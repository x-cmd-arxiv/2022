those from other sources, measurements impose isolation requirements which
restrict the hadronic radiation inside a cone around the photon. In this paper,
we perform a detailed factorization analysis of the QCD effects associated with
photon isolation. We show that for small cone radius $R$, photon isolation
effects can be captured by a fragmentation function describing the decay of a
parton into a photon accompanied by hadronic radiation. We compute this
fragmentation function for different isolation criteria and solve the
associated renormalization group equations to resum logarithms of $R$. For
small isolation energy, the cone fragmentation function factorizes further,
into collinear functions describing energetic quarks and gluons near the cone
boundary and functions encoding their soft radiation emitted into the cone.
Based on this factorization we also resum the non-global logarithms of the
ratio of the photon energy and the isolation energy, so that we control all
logarithmically enhanced terms in the cross section. Finally, we provide a
simple formula to convert NNLO cross section results from smooth-cone isolation
to fixed-cone isolation.

bandwidth, and form factor was not addressed in prior art. We investigate this
open research problem using a physically consistent modeling approach for
far-field (FF) MIMO communication based on multi-port circuit theory. In doing
so, we turn mutual coupling (MC) from a foe to a friend of MIMO systems design,
thereby challenging a basic percept in antenna systems engineering that
promotes MC mitigation/compensation. We show that tight MC widens the
operational bandwidth of antenna arrays thereby unleashing a missing MIMO gain

asymptotically optimum spacing-to-antenna-size ratio by establishing a
condition for tight coupling in the limit of large-size antenna arrays with
quasi-continuous apertures. We also optimize the antenna array size while
maximizing the achievable rate under fixed transmit power and inter-element

profiles from ab-initio numerical relativity binary neutron star merger

that the emission from thermal electrons dominates at early times. If the
interstellar medium density is high (${\simeq}0.1\,\ccm$) it adds an early time
peak to the light curve. As ejecta decelerates the spectral and temporal
indexes change in a characteristic way that, if observed, can be used to
reconstruct the ejecta velocity distribution. For the low interstellar medium
density, inferred for GRB 170817A, the emission from the non-thermal electron

curves change if the interstellar medium has been partially removed and
pre-accelerated by laterally expanding gamma-ray burst ejecta. We find that the
main effect is the emission suppression at early time ${\lesssim}10^{3}\,$days,

ejecta moves subsonically through the wake of laterally spreading gamma-ray

stochastic local winner-takes-all (LWTA) activations. This type of network
units results in sparse representations from each model layer, as the units are
organized into blocks where only one unit generates a non-zero output. The main
operating principle of the introduced units rely on stochastic principles, as
the network performs posterior sampling over competing units to select the
winner. Therefore, the proposed networks are explicitly designed to extract
input data representations of sparse stochastic nature, as opposed to the
currently standard deterministic representation paradigm. Our approach produces
state-of-the-art predictive accuracy on few-shot image classification and
regression experiments, as well as reduced predictive error on an active
learning setting; these improvements come with an immensely reduced
computational cost.

in flat spacetime from the perspective of boundary celestial conformal field
theory (CCFT). A key ingredient in connecting the two sides is the celestial
amplitude, which is given by the Mellin transform of momentum space scattering
amplitude in energy. As such, celestial amplitudes can be identified with the
correlation functions in celestial conformal field theory. In this paper, we
introduce the further notion of celestial Mellin amplitude, which is given by
the Mellin transform of celestial amplitude in coordinate. For technical
reasons, we focus on the celestial Mellin amplitudes for scalar fields in three
dimensional flat spacetime dual to 1D CCFT, and discuss the celestial Mellin
block expansion. In particular, the poles of the celestial Mellin amplitude
encode the scaling dimensions of the possible exchanged operators, while the
residues there are related to the OPE coefficient squares in a linear and
explicit way. We also compare the celestial Mellin amplitudes with the
coefficient functions which can be obtained using inversion formulae. Finally,
we make some comments about the possible generalizations of celestial Mellin
amplitudes to higher dimensions.

defect can be alternatively described as the degree in $q^{\pm 2}$ of the
fundamental Alexander polynomial, which formally corresponds to the case of no
colors. We also pose a question if these Alexander polynomials can be arbitrary
integer polynomials of a given degree. A first attempt to answer the latter
question is a preliminary analysis of antiparallel descendants of the 2-strand

The answer turns out to be positive in the case of defect zero knots, what can
be observed already in the case of twist knots. This proved conjecture also

using the limited resources of a software project.
  OBJECTIVE: The goal of this research is to assist managers and other
decision-makers in making informed choices about the use of software
vulnerability detection techniques through an empirical study of the efficiency
and effectiveness of four techniques on a Java-based web application.
  METHOD: We apply four different categories of vulnerability detection
techniques \textendash~ systematic manual penetration testing (SMPT),
exploratory manual penetration testing (EMPT), dynamic application security
testing (DAST), and static application security testing (SAST) \textendash\ to
an open-source medical records system.
  RESULTS: We found the most vulnerabilities using SAST. However, EMPT found
more severe vulnerabilities. With each technique, we found unique
vulnerabilities not found using the other techniques. The efficiency of manual
techniques (EMPT, SMPT) was comparable to or better than the efficiency of
automated techniques (DAST, SAST) in terms of Vulnerabilities per Hour (VpH).
  CONCLUSIONS: The vulnerability detection technique practitioners should
select may vary based on the goals and available resources of the project. If
the goal of an organization is to find ""all"" vulnerabilities in a project, they
need to use as many techniques as their resources allow.

of giant planets sculpting gas and dust in the disk, or the opening of a gap by

the observations of planets and deep depletions in gas within the gap some
disks, many T Tauri stars hosting transition disks accrete at rates typical for
an undepleted disk, raising the question of how gap opening occurs in these
objects. We thus present an analysis of the structure of the transition disk
around the T Tauri star DM Tau, which is strongly accreting ($\sim
10^{-8.3}~\mathrm{M}_\odot~ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) and turbulent ($\alpha=0.078 \pm
0.02$). Using the DALI thermochemical code, we fit disk models to
simultaneously reproduce the accretion rate, high level of turbulence, the gas
traced by ALMA band 6 observations of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O
J=2--1 lines, and the observed dust emission from the mm continuum and spectral
energy distribution. We find a shallow depletion in gas surface density of
$\sim 10$ relative to the outer disk and a gas rich inner disk is consistent
with the observations. The planet mass of $<1$ M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ implied by the
gap depth is in tension with predictions for dust trapping in a highly viscous
disk, which requires a more massive planet of of $\sim10$M$_\mathrm{Jup}$.
Photoevaporative models including a dead zone can qualitatively reproduce some
features of the DM Tau disk, but still struggle to explain the high accretion

history. However, only the brightest individual $z\gtrsim8$ objects could be
detected with Spitzer, making it difficult to robustly constrain activity at
$z\gtrsim10$. Here, we leverage the greatly improved rest-optical sensitivity
of JWST at $z\gtrsim8$ to constrain the ages of seven UV-bright
($M_{UV}\lesssim-19.5$) galaxies selected to lie at $z\sim8.5-11$, then
investigate implications for $z\gtrsim15$ star formation. We infer the
properties of individual objects with two spectral energy distribution

galaxies. We find a median age of $\sim20$ Myr, younger than that inferred at
$z\sim7$ with a similar analysis, consistent with an evolution towards larger
specific star formation rates at early times. The age distribution suggests
that only $\sim3$ percent of bright $z\sim8.5-11$ galaxies would be similarly
luminous at $z\gtrsim15$, implying that the number density of bright galaxies
declines by at least an order of magnitude between $z\sim8.5-11$ and $z\sim15$.
This evolution is challenging to reconcile with some early JWST results
suggesting the abundance of bright galaxies does not significantly decrease
towards very early times, but we suggest this tension may be eased if young
stellar populations form on top of older stellar components, or if bright

beyond, elevation has its limitations. The zero-elevation datum is defined by
arbitrary and inconsistent conventions, especially on planets without a sea
level, hence the lack of a universally standardized way to quantify relief.
Furthermore, when quantifying relief on such planets, the elevation of a point
is rather meaningless on its own, deriving most of its value when compared to
the elevation of other points. In light of these considerations, this paper
introduces a universally consistent framework for quantifying relief that does
not require a datum altogether, and is instead based on physically meaningful
concepts. Designed to be mathematically elegant and free of arbitrary
parameters, the so-called datumless measures are divided into the datumless
point measures and the datumless surface measures. As opposed to elevation,
which describes the vertical position of a point relative to a datum, the
datumless point measures directly describe the vertical position of a point
relative to local terrain, making them useful for comparing the relief of
features such as mountains across different planets. In the meantime, the
datumless surface measures quantify various aspects of relief within a region,
as opposed to that of a single point. This is done through datumless
formulations of surface area and surface mean value, which can be directly
applied to the fractal-like planetary surface without projecting it onto a
reference ellipsoid. Altogether, this paper lays the groundwork for a datumless
framework that enables future topographic tasks to transcend the limitations of
elevation.

functions can be leveraged to reliably compress large multidimensional medical
image datasets, with proof-of-concept application to 4D diffusion-weighted MRI
(dMRI). In the medical imaging landscape, multidimensional MRI is a key area of
research for developing biomarkers that are both sensitive and specific to the
underlying tissue microstructure. However, the high-dimensional nature of these
data poses a challenge in terms of both storage and sharing capabilities and
associated costs, requiring appropriate algorithms able to represent the
information in a low-dimensional space. Recent theoretical developments in deep
learning have shown how periodic activation functions are a powerful tool for
implicit neural representation of images and can be used for compression of 2D
images. Here we extend this approach to 4D images and show how any given 4D
dMRI dataset can be accurately represented through the parameters of a
sinusoidal activation network, achieving a data compression rate about 10 times
higher than the standard DEFLATE algorithm. Our results show that the proposed
approach outperforms benchmark ReLU and Tanh activation perceptron
architectures in terms of mean squared error, peak signal-to-noise ratio and
structural similarity index. Subsequent analyses using the tensor and spherical
harmonics representations demonstrate that the proposed lossy compression
reproduces accurately the characteristics of the original data, leading to
relative errors about 5 to 10 times lower than the benchmark JPEG2000 lossy
compression and similar to standard pre-processing steps such as MP-PCA
denosing, suggesting a loss of information within the currently accepted levels

manufacturing tasks. Yet, for dexterous, contact-rich tasks, it is often
difficult to find the right skill parameters. One strategy is to learn these
parameters by allowing the robot system to learn directly on the task. For a
learning problem, a robot operator can typically specify the type and range of
values of the parameters. Nevertheless, given their prior experience, robot
operators should be able to help the learning process further by providing
educated guesses about where in the parameter space potential optimal solutions
could be found. Interestingly, such prior knowledge is not exploited in current
robot learning frameworks. We introduce an approach that combines user priors
and Bayesian optimization to allow fast optimization of robot industrial tasks
at robot deployment time. We evaluate our method on three tasks that are
learned in simulation as well as on two tasks that are learned directly on a
real robot system. Additionally, we transfer knowledge from the corresponding
simulation tasks by automatically constructing priors from well-performing
configurations for learning on the real system. To handle potentially
contradicting task objectives, the tasks are modeled as multi-objective
problems. Our results show that operator priors, both user-specified and
transferred, vastly accelerate the discovery of rich Pareto fronts, and
typically produce final performance far superior to proposed baselines.

techniques for systems with circumstellar disks. Constrained RDI utilizes
either high-resolution polarized intensity (PI) images or disk models to
severely limit or even eliminate the signal loss due to oversubtraction that is
common to RDI.
  We demonstrate the ability of constrained RDI utilizing polarimetric data to

importantly, resulting output are frequently difficult to interpret, especially
without in-depth data science or statistical training. This endangers the final
step of analysis where an actionable and clinically meaningful interpretation
is needed.This study investigates approaches to perform patient stratification
analysis at scale using large EHR datasets and multiple clustering methods for
clinical research. We have developed several tools to facilitate the clinical
evaluation and interpretation of unsupervised patient stratification results,
namely pattern screening, meta clustering, surrogate modeling, and curation.
These tools can be used at different stages within the analysis. As compared to
a standard analysis approach, we demonstrate the ability to condense results

the number of patient clusters can be reduced from 72 to 3 in one example. In
another stratification result, by using surrogate models, we could quickly
identify that heart failure patients were stratified if blood sodium
measurements were available. As this is a routine measurement performed for all
patients with heart failure, this indicated a data bias. By using further
cohort and feature curation, these patients and other irrelevant features could
be removed to increase the clinical meaningfulness. These examples show the
effectiveness of the proposed methods and we hope to encourage further research

to dust attenuation throughout the galaxy. Considerable attention has focused
on identifying reionization-era galaxies with very blue UV slopes ($\beta<-3$).
Not only do such systems provide a signpost of low-metallicity stars, but they
also identify galaxies likely to leak ionizing photons from their HII regions
as such blue UV slopes require the reddening effect of nebular continuum to be
diminished. In this paper we present a search for reionization-era galaxies
with very blue UV colors in recent JWST/NIRCam imaging of the EGS field. We
characterize UV slopes for a large sample of$~z\simeq7-11~$galaxies, finding a
median of$~\beta=-2.0$. Two lower luminosity (M$_{\rm{UV}}\simeq-19.5$) and
lower stellar mass (6-10$\times10^7$M$_\odot$) systems exhibit extremely blue
UV slopes ($\beta=-2.9~$to$~-3.1$) and rest-optical photometry indicating weak
nebular line emission. Each system is very compact (r$_e\lesssim$260pc) with
very high star-formation-rate surface densities. We model the SEDs with a suite
of BEAGLE models with varying levels of ionizing photon escape. The SEDs cannot
be reproduced with our fiducial (f$_{\rm{esc,HII}}$=0) or alpha-enhanced
(Z$_\star<Z_{\rm{ISM}}$) models. The combined blue UV slopes and weak nebular
emission are best-fit by models with significant ionizing photon escape from
HII regions (f$_{\rm{esc,HII}}$=0.5-0.8) and extremely low-metallicity massive
stars (Z$_\star$=0.01-0.06Z$_\odot$). The discovery of these galaxies
highlights the potential for JWST to identify large numbers of candidate Lyman
Continuum leaking galaxies in the reionization-era and suggests low-metallicity
stellar populations may be common in dwarf galaxies at $z>7$.

using the first 90 arcmin$^2$ JWST/NIRCam images taken by the early release
observations (ERO) and early release science (ERS) programs. With the JWST
simulation images, we find that a number of foreground interlopers are selected
with a weak photo-$z$ determination ($\Delta\chi^2>4$). We thus carefully apply
a secure photo-$z$ selection criterion ($\Delta\chi^2>9$) and conventional
color criteria with confirmations of the ERO NIRSpec spectroscopic redshifts,
and obtain a total of 23 dropout galaxies at $z\sim9-16$, including two
candidates at $z_\mathrm{phot}=16.25_{-0.46}^{+0.24}$ and
$16.41_{-0.55}^{+0.66}$. We perform thorough comparisons of dropout galaxies
found in our work with recent JWST studies, and conclude that our galaxy sample
is reliable enough for statistical analyses. We derive the UV luminosity
functions at $z\sim9-16$, and confirm that our UV luminosity functions at
$z\sim 9$ and $12$ agree with those determined by other HST and JWST studies.
The cosmic star-formation rate density decreases from $z\sim9$ to $12$, and
perhaps to $16$, but the densities at $z\sim12-16$ are higher than the constant
star formation efficiency model. Interestingly, there are six bright galaxy
candidates at $z\sim10-16$ with $M_\mathrm{UV}<-19.5$ mag and $M_*\sim10^{8-9}
M_\odot$. Because a majority ($\sim80$\%) of these galaxies show no signatures
of AGNs in their morphologies, the high cosmic star-formation rate densities
and the existence of these UV-luminous galaxies are explained by no suppression
of star-formation by the UV background radiation at the pre-reionization epoch
and/or an efficient UV radiation production by a top-heavy IMF with Population
III-like star formation.

curves (AUCs) and their differences is a key task in diagnostic studies. We
aimed to derive, evaluate, and implement simple sample size formulas for such
studies with a focus on estimation rather than hypothesis testing.
  Materials and Methods: Sample size formulas were developed by explicitly
incorporating pre-specified precision and assurance, with precision denoted by
the lower limit of confidence interval and assurance denoted by the probability
of achieving that lower limit. A new variance function was proposed for valid
estimation allowing for unequal variances of observations in the disease and
non-disease groups. Performance of the proposed formulas was evaluated through
simulation.
  Results: Closed-form sample size formulas were obtained. Simulation results
demonstrated that the proposed formulas produced empirical assurance
probability close to the pre-specified assurance probability and empirical
coverage probability close to the nominal 95%. Real-world worked examples were
presented for illustration.
  Conclusions: Sample size formulas based on estimation of AUCs and their
differences were developed. Simulation results suggested good performance in
terms of achieving pre-specified precision and assurance probability. An online

gas mass tracers in galaxies, the $\rm ^{12}CO$(1-0), [CI]($^3P_1$-$^3P_0$)
lines, and the submm dust continuum emission, using a sample of 407 galaxies,
ranging from local disks to submillimetre-selected galaxies (SMGs) up to $z
\approx 6$. A Bayesian method is used to produce galaxy-scale universal
calibrations of these molecular gas indicators, that hold over 3-4 orders of
magnitude in infrared luminosity, $L_{\rm IR}$. Regarding the dust continuum,
we use a mass-weighted dust temperature, $T_{\rm mw}$, determined using new
empirical relations between temperature and luminosity. We find the average
$L/M_{\rm mol}$ gas mass conversion factors to be $\alpha_{850}=
6.9\times10^{12}\,\rm W\,Hz^{-1}\,M_{\odot}^{-1}$, $\alpha_{\rm CO} = \rm
4\,M_{\odot} (K\,km\,s^{-1}\,pc^2)^{-1}$ and $\alpha_{\rm CI} = \rm 17.0

dust properties of the sample ($\kappa_H$ = gas-to-dust ratio/dust emissivity)
will be similar to those of local metal rich galaxies and the MW. The tracer
with the least intrinsic scatter is [CI](1-0), while CO(1-0) has the highest.
The conversion factors show a weak but significant correlation with $L_{\rm
IR}$. Assuming dust properties typical of metal-rich galaxies, we infer a
neutral carbon abundance $X_{\rm CI} = [C^0/\rm mol]=1.6\times 10^{-5}$,
similar to that in the MW. We find no evidence for bimodality of $\alpha_{\rm
CO}$ between main-sequence (MS) galaxies and those with extreme star-formation
intensity, i.e. ULIRGs and SMGs. The means of the three conversion factors are
found to be similar between MS galaxies and ULIRGs/SMGs, to within 10-20%. We
show that for metal-rich galaxies, near-universal average values for
$\alpha_{\rm CO}$, $X_{\rm CI}$ and $\kappa_H$ are adequate for global
molecular gas estimates.

memristor crossbar arrays, and optical accelerators. Optical systems can
perform linear matrix operations at exceptionally high rate and efficiency,
motivating recent demonstrations of low latency linear algebra and optical
energy consumption below a photon per multiply-accumulate operation. However,
demonstrating systems that co-integrate both linear and nonlinear processing
units in a single chip remains a central challenge. Here we introduce such a
system in a scalable photonic integrated circuit (PIC), enabled by several key
advances: (i) high-bandwidth and low-power programmable nonlinear optical
function units (NOFUs); (ii) coherent matrix multiplication units (CMXUs); and
(iii) in situ training with optical acceleration. We experimentally demonstrate
this fully-integrated coherent optical neural network (FICONN) architecture for
a 3-layer DNN comprising 12 NOFUs and three CMXUs operating in the telecom
C-band. Using in situ training on a vowel classification task, the FICONN
achieves 92.7% accuracy on a test set, which is identical to the accuracy
obtained on a digital computer with the same number of weights. This work lends
experimental evidence to theoretical proposals for in situ training, unlocking
orders of magnitude improvements in the throughput of training data. Moreover,
the FICONN opens the path to inference at nanosecond latency and femtojoule per
operation energy efficiency.

thanks to their remarkable capabilities of generating highly diverse images
that follow given text prompts. Such text-based synthesis methods are
particularly appealing to humans who are used to verbally describe their
intent. Therefore, it is only natural to extend the text-driven image synthesis
to text-driven image editing. Editing is challenging for these generative
models, since an innate property of an editing technique is to preserve most of
the original image, while in the text-based models, even a small modification
of the text prompt often leads to a completely different outcome.
State-of-the-art methods mitigate this by requiring the users to provide a
spatial mask to localize the edit, hence, ignoring the original structure and
content within the masked region. In this paper, we pursue an intuitive
prompt-to-prompt editing framework, where the edits are controlled by text
only. To this end, we analyze a text-conditioned model in depth and observe
that the cross-attention layers are the key to controlling the relation between
the spatial layout of the image to each word in the prompt. With this
observation, we present several applications which monitor the image synthesis
by editing the textual prompt only. This includes localized editing by
replacing a word, global editing by adding a specification, and even delicately
controlling the extent to which a word is reflected in the image. We present
our results over diverse images and prompts, demonstrating high-quality
synthesis and fidelity to the edited prompts.

conformal partial wave expansion of celestial correlators which, at least
perturbatively, should be a meromorphic function of the spectral parameter. We
also discuss non-perturbative constraints from unitarity in Euclidean Conformal
Field Theory, which requires positivity of the spectral density. This extends
similar relations recently uncovered between boundary correlation functions in

morphologies. Here we report on a first view of starlight from a subset of the
HST-dark population that are bright with JWST/NIRCam (4.4$\mu$m<24.5mag) and
very faint or even invisible with HST ($<$1.6$\mu$m). In this Letter we focus
on a dramatic and unanticipated population of physically extended galaxies
($\gtrsim$0.17''). These 12 galaxies have photometric redshifts $2<z<6$, high
stellar masses $M_{\star}\gtrsim 10^{10}~M_{\odot}$, and significant
dust-attenuated star formation. Surprisingly, the galaxies have elongated
projected axis ratios at 4.4$\mu$m, suggesting that the population is
disk-dominated or prolate. Most of the galaxies appear red at all radii,
suggesting significant dust attenuation throughout. We refer to these red,
disky, HST-dark galaxies as Ultra-red Flattened Objects (UFOs). With
$r_e$(F444W)$\sim1-2$~kpc, the galaxies are similar in size to compact massive
galaxies at $z\sim2$ and the cores of massive galaxies and S0s at $z\sim0$. The
stellar masses, sizes, and morphologies of the sample suggest that some could
be progenitors of lenticular or fast-rotating galaxies in the local Universe.
The existence of this population suggests that our previous censuses of the
universe may have missed massive, dusty edge-on disks, in addition to
dust-obscured starbursts.

of coupled quantum dots with interactions decaying as $\frac{1}{r^{\alpha}}$,
where each dot hosts $N$ degrees of freedom. The large $N$ limit corresponds to
the mean-field description, while quantum fluctuations contributing to the OTOC

previously found for $N=1$ and generic finite $N$. In order to reproduce these
scalings, the fractional index $\mu$ in the FKPP equation needs to be shifted
from the na\""ive value of $\mu = 2\alpha - 1$ to a renormalized value $\mu =

wino-like neutralino is assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle
(LSP). The associated squark-wino production, $pp \to \tilde q \widetilde W$,
then leads to a monojet-like signature, where the high $p_T$ jet is originated
from the squark decay, $\tilde q \to q + \widetilde W$. We demonstrate that
this associated production, as well as the $pp \to \widetilde W \widetilde W +

squark-neutralino mass plane. The second scenario postulates that the lighter
of the squark and gluino is only a few GeV heavier than the LSP neutralino. The
associated squark-gluino production, $pp \to \tilde q \tilde g$, then leads to
a distinctive monojet signature, where the high $p_T$ jet is produced from the
decay of the heavier coloured particle into the lighter one ($\tilde q \to q +
\tilde g$ for $m_{\tilde q} > m_{\tilde g}$ and $\tilde g \to q + \tilde q$ for
$m_{\tilde g} > m_{\tilde q}$). The lighter coloured particle is effectively
regarded as an invisible particle since the decay products are soft due to the
approximate mass degeneracy. We recast existing monojet and dijet analyses and
find a non-trivial exclusion limit in the squark-gluino mass plane in this

a combination of the density, temperature, and shock age profiles of the X-ray

the results of numerical simulations with observations, we indicate that the
bubbles were created by a fast wind from the GC because it generates a strong
reverse shock and reproduces the observed temperature peak there. On the other
hand, instantaneous energy injection at the GC cannot reproduce the temperature
profile. The wind had a speed of ~1000 km/s, and blew for ~10^7 yr. Because the
mass flux of the wind is large, the entrainment of interstellar gas by
wide-angle outflows from the black hole is required. Thus, the wind may be the
same as active galactic nuclei outflows often observed in other galaxies and

retrieved atmospheric abundances (e.g. C/O, metallicity). This precludes clear
insights into the formation mechanisms of these companions. The Keck Planet
Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) uses adaptive optics and single-mode fibers to
transport light into NIRSPEC ($R\sim35,000$ in $K$ band), and aims to address
these challenges with high-resolution spectroscopy. Using an atmospheric
retrieval framework based on petitRADTRANS, we analyze KPIC high-resolution
spectrum ($2.29-2.49~\mu$m) and archival low-resolution spectrum ($1-2.2~\mu$m)
of the benchmark brown dwarf HD 4747 B ($m=67.2\pm1.8~M_{\rm{Jup}}$,

the $K$ band high-resolution spectrum are also independent of our choice of
cloud model. In contrast, the retrieved parameters from the low-resolution

gas, radiation, and (minimum-energy) magnetic pressures around $\approx$200
star-forming regions in a sample of nearby normal and luminous infrared
galaxies is presented. Given the range of galaxy distances, pressure estimates
are made on spatial scales spanning $\sim$0.1$-3$kpc. The ratio of thermal
gas-to-radiation pressures does not appear to significantly depend on star
formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), but exhibits a steady
decrease with increasing physical size of the aperture over which the
quantities are measured. The ratio of magnetic-to-radiation pressures appears
to be relatively flat as a function of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and similar in value
for both nuclear and extranuclear regions, but unlike the ratio of thermal
gas-to-radiation pressures, exhibits a steady increase with increasing aperture
size. Furthermore, it seems that the magnetic pressure is typically weaker than
the radiation pressure on sub-kpc scales, and only starts to play a significant
role on few-kpc scales. When the internal pressure terms are summed, their
ratio to the ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$-inferred) kpc-scale dynamical equilibrium
pressure estimates is roughly constant. Consequently, it appears that the
physical area of the galaxy disk, and not necessarily environment (e.g.,
nuclear vs. extranuclear regions) or star formation activity, may play the
dominant role in determining which pressure term is most active around
star-forming regions. These results are consistent with a scenario in which a
combination of processes acting primarily on different physical scales work
collectively to regulate the star formation process in galaxy disks.

we show that this may not be true. We examined and identified 45 ram-pressure
stripped galaxy candidates from a sample of 1311 galaxy group members within
125 spectroscopically-selected galaxy groups. 13 of these galaxies are the most
secure candidates with multiple distinct features. These candidate ram pressure
stripped galaxies have similar properties to those found in clusters -- they
occur at a range of stellar masses, are largely blue and star-forming and have
phase-space distributions consistent with being first infallers into their
groups. The only stand-out feature of these candidates is they exist not in
clusters, but in groups, with a median halo mass of 10$^{13.5}$ M$_\odot$.
Although this may seem surprising, we employ an analytic model of the expected
ram pressure stripping force in groups and find that reasonable estimates of
the relevant infall speeds and intragroup medium content would result in ram
pressure stripped galaxies at these halo masses. Finally, given the
considerable uncertainty on the lifetime of the ram-pressure phase, this
physical mechanism could be the dominant quenching mechanism in galaxy groups,
if our ram pressure stripped candidates can be confirmed.

BH mass. The accuracy of these single-epoch masses, however, is unknown, and
there are few empirical constraints on the variance of $f$ between objects. We
attempt to calibrate single-epoch BH masses using spectropolarimetric

notoriously challenging to hunt in laboratory experiments. Here we propose a
novel pathway to test such a production in the context of a non-standard
cosmological history, using both gravitational wave (GW) and laboratory
searches. We investigate the formation of DM from the decay of a scalar field
that we dub as the reheaton, as it also reheats the Universe when it decays. We
consider the possibility that the Universe undergoes a phase %of kination with
\textit{kination-like} stiff equation-of-state ($w_{\rm kin}>1/3$) before the
reheaton dominates the energy density of the Universe and eventually decays
into Standard Model and DM particles. We then study how first-order tensor
perturbations generated during inflation, the amplitude of which may get
amplified during the kination era and lead to detectable GW signals. Demanding
that the reheaton produces the observed DM relic density, we show that the
reheaton's lifetime and branching fractions are dictated by the cosmological
scenario. In particular, we show that it is long-lived and can be searched by
various experiments such as DUNE, FASER, FASER-II, MATHUSLA, SHiP, etc. We also
identify the parameter space which leads to complementary observables for GW
detectors such as LISA and u-DECIGO. In particular we find that a kination-like
period with an equation-of-state parameter $w_{\rm kin}\approx 0.5$ and a
reheaton mass $\mathcal O(0.5-5)$ GeV and a DM mass of $\mathcal O (10-100)$
keV may lead to sizeable imprints in both kinds of searches.

constraints on the future dynamical evolution of massive overcontact systems by
measuring the rate at which the periods change for a sample of six such
objects. Furthermore, we aim to investigate whether the periods of unequal mass
systems show higher rates of change than their equal mass counterparts as
theoretical models predict. Using archival photometric data from various
ground- and space-based missions covering up to ~40 years, we measure the
periods of each system over several smaller time spans. We then fit a linear
regression through the measured periods to determine the rate at which the
period is changing over the entire data set. We find that all of the stars in
our sample have very small period changes and that there does not seem to be a
correlation with the mass ratio. This implies that the orbital periods for
these systems are stable on the nuclear timescale, and that the unequal mass
systems may not equalize as expected. When comparing our results with
population synthesis distributions, we find large discrepancies between the
expected mass ratios and period stabilities. We find that these discrepancies
can be mitigated to a degree by removing systems with shorter initial periods,
suggesting that the observed sample of overcontact systems may originate from
binary systems with longer initial orbital periods.

the higher stellar masses, but Pop~III-dominated galaxies are too faint to be

historic optical dimming during 2020 January 27 $-$ February 13. Many imaging
and spectroscopic observations across the electromagnetic spectrum were
obtained prior to, during, and subsequent to this dimming event. These
observations of Betelgeuse reveal that a substantial surface mass ejection
(SME) occurred and moved out through the extended atmosphere of the supergiant.
A photospheric shock occurred in 2019 January - March, progressed through the
extended atmosphere of the star during the following 11 months and led to dust
production in the atmosphere. Resulting from the substantial mass outflow, the
stellar photosphere was left with lower temperatures and the chromosphere with
a lower density. The mass ejected could represent a significant fraction of the
total annual mass loss rate from the star suggesting that episodic mass loss
events can contribute an amount comparable to that of the stellar wind.
Following the SME, Betelgeuse was left with a cooler average photosphere, an
unusual short photometric oscillation, reduced velocity excursions, and the

U-Band Efficient Spectrograph (CUBES) that is now in construction for the Very

across Solar System, Galactic and extragalactic astronomy, where observations
are limited by the performance of current ground-based spectrographs shortwards
of 400nm. A brief background to each case is presented and specific technical
requirements on the instrument design that flow-down from each case are
identified. These were used as inputs to the CUBES design, that will provide a
factor of ten gain in efficiency for astronomical spectroscopy over 300-405nm,
at resolving powers of R~24,000 and ~7,000. We include performance estimates
that demonstrate the ability of CUBES to observe sources that are up to three
magnitudes fainter than currently possible at ground-ultraviolet wavelengths,
and we place its predicted performance in the context of existing facillities.

rotation profile in a low-mass lower-luminosity giant star. For most low- and
intermediate-mass stars, the rotation on the main sequence seems to be close to
rigid. As these stars evolve into giants, the core contracts and the envelope
expands, which should suggest a radial rotation profile with a fast core and a
slower envelope and surface. KIC 9267654, however, seems to show a surface
rotation rate that is faster than its bulk envelope rotation rate, in conflict
with this simple angular momentum conservation argument. We improve the
spectroscopic surface constraint, show that the pulsation frequencies are
consistent with the previously published core and envelope rotation rates, and
demonstrate that the star does not show strong chemical peculiarities. We
discuss the evidence against any tidally interacting stellar companion.
Finally, we discuss the possible origin of this unusual rotation profile,
including the potential ingestion of a giant planet or unusual angular momentum
transport by tidal inertial waves triggered by a close substellar companion,
and encourage further observational and theoretical efforts.

the total infrared (derived from 12$\mu$m) to radio luminosity ratio, q(TIR),

activity in massive galaxies generally appearing quiescent in the infrared, it
becomes less reliable for cases where the emission from star formation in the
host galaxy is dominant. However, we find that the q(TIR) can identify up to 70

cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in the artificial

been focused on developing practical MARL algorithms whose effectiveness has
been studied only empirically, thereby lacking theoretical guarantees. As
recent studies have revealed, MARL methods often achieve performance that is
unstable in terms of reward monotonicity or suboptimal at convergence. To
resolve these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework named
Heterogeneous-Agent Mirror Learning (HAML) that provides a general template for

template satisfy the desired properties of the monotonic improvement of the
joint reward and the convergence to Nash equilibrium. We verify the
practicality of HAML by proving that the current state-of-the-art cooperative

natural outcome of our theory, we propose HAML extensions of two well-known RL
algorithms, HAA2C (for A2C) and HADDPG (for DDPG), and demonstrate their
effectiveness against strong baselines on StarCraftII and Multi-Agent MuJoCo

each property's loss function, which is done in a matrix-free manner via
randomized numerical linear algebra. We evaluate our hypothesis on two

to derive a compact surface representation for a given dense point cloud or

the Loop subdivision surface, which in the limit yields the smooth surface
underlying the point cloud, and can handle complex surface topology better than
other popular compact representations, such as NURBS. The principal idea is to
fit the Loop subdivision surface not directly to the point cloud, but to the

both Loop subdivision and IMLS have analytical expressions, we are able to
formulate the problem as an unconstrained minimization problem of a completely

Differentiability enables us to integrate the subdivision surface into any deep

  Collaboration (OpenSym 2022)",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Motivation. Digital commons is an emerging phenomenon and of increasing
importance, as we enter a digital society. Open data is one example that makes
up a pivotal input and foundation for many of today's digital services and
applications. Ensuring sustainable provisioning and maintenance of the data,
therefore, becomes even more important. Aim. We aim to investigate how such
provisioning and maintenance can be collaboratively performed in the community
surrounding a common. Specifically, we look at Open Data Ecosystems (ODEs), a
type of community of actors, openly sharing and evolving data on a
technological platform. Method. We use Elinor Ostrom's design principles for
Common Pool Resources as a lens to systematically analyze the governance of
earlier reported cases of ODEs using a theory-oriented software engineering
framework. Results. We find that, while natural commons must regulate
consumption, digital commons such as open data maintained by an ODE must
stimulate both use and data provisioning. Governance needs to enable such
stimulus while also ensuring that the collective action can still be
coordinated and managed within the frame of available maintenance resources of
a community. Subtractability is, in this sense, a concern regarding the
resources required to maintain the quality and value of the data, rather than
the availability of data. Further, we derive empirically-based recommended
practices for ODEs based on the design principles by Ostrom for how to design a
governance structure in a way that enables a sustainable and collaborative
provisioning and maintenance of the data. Conclusion. ODEs are expected to play
a role in data provisioning which democratize the digital society and enables
innovation from smaller commercial actors. Our empirically based guidelines
intend to support this development.

  Systems to Enhance Cultural Citizenship","The 16th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems",,"10.1145/3523227.3551476",,"cs.CY cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recommender systems have become the dominant means of curating cultural
content, significantly influencing the nature of individual cultural
experience. While the majority of research on recommender systems optimizes for
personalized user experience, this paradigm does not capture the ways that
recommender systems impact cultural experience in the aggregate, across
populations of users. Although existing novelty, diversity, and fairness
studies probe how systems relate to the broader social role of cultural
content, they do not adequately center culture as a core concept and challenge.
In this work, we introduce commonality as a new measure that reflects the
degree to which recommendations familiarize a given user population with
specified categories of cultural content. Our proposed commonality metric
responds to a set of arguments developed through an interdisciplinary dialogue
between researchers in computer science and the social sciences and humanities.
With reference to principles underpinning non-profit, public service media
systems in democratic societies, we identify universality of address and
content diversity in the service of strengthening cultural citizenship as
particularly relevant goals for recommender systems delivering cultural
content. Taking diversity in movie recommendation as a case study in enhancing
pluralistic cultural experience, we empirically compare systems' performance
using commonality and existing utility, diversity, and fairness metrics. Our
results demonstrate that commonality captures a property of system behavior
complementary to existing metrics and suggest the need for alternative,
non-personalized interventions in recommender systems oriented to strengthening
cultural citizenship across populations of users. In this way, commonality
contributes to a growing body of scholarship developing 'public good'
rationales for digital media and ML systems.

multi-domain operations. CAPD addresses this problem by providing a
context-aware, policy-driven framework supporting data and knowledge exchange
among autonomous entities in a battlespace. We propose an IoBT ontology that
facilitates controlled information sharing to enable semantic interoperability
between systems. Its key contributions include providing a knowledge graph with
a shared semantic schema, integration with background knowledge, efficient
mechanisms for enforcing data consistency and drawing inferences, and
supporting attribute-based access control. The sensors in the IoBT provide data
that create populated knowledge graphs based on the ontology. This paper
describes using CAPD to detect and mitigate adversary actions. CAPD enables
situational awareness using reasoning over the sensed data and SPARQL queries.
For example, adversaries can cause sensor failure or hijacking and disrupt the
tactical networks to degrade video surveillance. In such instances, CAPD uses
an ontology-based reasoner to see how alternative approaches can still support
the mission. Depending on bandwidth availability, the reasoner initiates the
creation of a reduced frame rate grayscale video by active transcoding or
transmits only still images. This ability to reason over the mission sensed
environment and attack context permits the autonomous IoBT system to exhibit
resilience in contested conditions.

driving velocity. This field opposes the change of the external driving field
in a way reminiscent of Faraday's law of induction, justifying the term
'quantum dynamo effect'. For the specific situation of a periodically driven
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ on the Bloch sphere, we show that the work done by rolling
the spin from north to south pole can efficiently be converted into a coherent
displacement of the resonant bosonic modes, the effect thus corresponds to a
work-to-work conversion and allows to interpret this transmitted energy into
the bath as work. We study this effect, its performance and limitations in
detail for a driven spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ in the presence of a radial magnetic
field addressing a relation with topological systems through the formation of
an effective charge in the core of the sphere. We show that the dynamo effect
is directly related to the dynamically measured topology of this

protected method to convert driving work into a coherent field in the
reservoir. The quantum dynamo model is realizable in mesoscopic and atomic

training triplets equally, which ignores the subtle difference between
different positive or negative items. On the other hand, even though some other
works make use of the auxiliary information (e.g., dwell time) of user

to obtain. To mitigate the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel training

and block sizes under strong or long-range dependence. To establish guideposts
in block selection, we consider a broad class of strongly dependent time
processes, formed by a transformation of a stationary long-memory Gaussian
series, and examine block-based resampling estimators for the variance of the
prototypical sample mean; extensions to general statistical functionals are
also considered. Unlike weak dependence, the properties of resampling
estimators under strong dependence are shown to depend intricately on the
nature of non-linearity in the time series (beyond Hermite ranks) in addition
the long-memory coefficient and block size. Additionally, the intuition has
often been that optimal block sizes should be larger under strong dependence
(say $O(n^{1/2})$ for a sample size $n$) than the optimal order $O(n^{1/3})$
known under weak dependence. This intuition turns out to be largely incorrect,
though a block order $O(n^{1/2})$ may be reasonable (and even optimal) in many
cases, owing to non-linearity in a long-memory time series. While optimal block
sizes are more complex under long-range dependence compared to short-range, we
provide a consistent data-driven rule for block selection, and numerical
studies illustrate that the guides for block selection perform well in other

the case of $\tau$ decay with one heavy final-state neutrino with a mass around
$10^2 - 10^3$ MeV, where the linear term suppression could be of order
$10^{-4}$, low enough to be measured in current and forthcoming experiments.

stellar activity, convection noise, and instrumental noise, distorts the
exoplanet transit light curves and leads to biases in the best-fit transit
parameters. An optimal fitting algorithm can provide stability against the
presence of correlated noises and lead to statistically consistent results,
namely, the actual biases are usually within the error interval. This is not
automatically satisfied by most of the algorithms in everyday use and the
testing of the algorithms is necessary. Aims. In this paper, we describe a
bootstrapping-like test to handle with the general case and we apply it to the
wavelet-based Transit and Light Curve Modeller (TLCM) algorithm, testing it for
the stability against the correlated noise. We compare and contrast the results
with regard to the FITSH algorithm, which is based on an assumption of white
noise. Methods. We simulated transit light curves with previously known
parameters in the presence of a correlated noise model generated by an
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) process. Then we solved the
simulated observations and examined the resulting parameters and error
intervals. Results. We have found that the assumption of FITSH, namely, that
only white noise is present, has led to inconsistencies in the results: the
distribution of best-fit parameters is then broader than the determined error
intervals by a factor of 3-6. On the other hand, the wavelet-based TLCM
algorithm handles the correlated noise properly, leading to both properly
determined parameter and error intervals that are perfectly consistent with the
actual biases

modeling stochastic dynamical systems. When the event is rare in comparison
with the timescales of simulation and/or measurement needed to resolve the

challenging. In such cases a more effective approach is to cast statistics of
interest as solutions to Feynman-Kac equations (partial differential
equations). Here, we develop an approach to solve Feynman-Kac equations by
training neural networks on short-trajectory data. Our approach is based on a
Markov approximation but otherwise avoids assumptions about the underlying
model and dynamics. This makes it applicable to treating complex computational
models and observational data. We illustrate the advantages of our method using
a low-dimensional model that facilitates visualization, and this analysis
motivates an adaptive sampling strategy that allows on-the-fly identification
of and addition of data to regions important for predicting the statistics of
interest. Finally, we demonstrate that we can compute accurate statistics for a
75-dimensional model of sudden stratospheric warming. This system provides a
stringent test bed for our method.

with a new algorithm to estimate $\Psi(x,y)$, with a performance improvement to
an established algorithm, and with empirically based advice on how to choose an

  Our new algorithm to estimate $\Psi(x,y)$ is based on Ennola's second theorem

It takes $O(y^2/\log y)$ arithmetic operations of precomputation and $O(y\log

ranges of applicability, as given in theorems, often include unknown constants

regenerative relaying-based wireless communication system assisted by
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In particular, the setup consists
of a source node communicating with a destination node via a regenerative
relay. In this setup, a RIS is installed in each hop to increase the
source-relay and relay-destination communications reliability, where the RISs'
phase shifts are subject to quantization errors. The legitimate transmission is
performed under the presence of a malicious eavesdropper attempting to
compromise the legitimate transmissions by overhearing the broadcasted signal
from the relay. To overcome this problem, we incorporate a jammer to increase
the system's secrecy by disrupting the eavesdropper through a broadcasted
jamming signal. Leveraging the well-adopted Gamma and Exponential distributions
approximations, the system's secrecy level is quantified by deriving
approximate and asymptotic expressions of the secrecy intercept probability
(IP) metric in terms of the main network parameters. The results show that the
secrecy is enhanced significantly by increasing the jamming power and/or the
number of reflective elements (REs). In particular, an IP of approximately
$10^{-4}$ can be reached with $40$ REs and $10$ dB of jamming power-to-noise
ratio even when the legitimate links' average signal-to-noise ratios are
$10$-dB less than the eavesdropper's one. We show that cooperative jamming is
very helpful in strong eavesdropping scenarios with a fixed number of REs, and
the number of quantization bits does not influence the secrecy when exceeding
$3$ bits. All the analytical results are endorsed by Monte Carlo simulations.

expressions are possible for harmonic systems, anharmonic systems tend to be
much more difficult to treat. In this manuscript, we investigate how the
microscopic probability for anharmonic systems is modified in the presence of
non-conservative forces. We recount how non-conservative corrections to
microscopic probabilities in generic systems can be represented as integrals
over Green's function kernels, and that these Green's functions take the form
of path integrals. We show how using analytically tractable form of these
functions allows us to calculate corrections to the microscopic probability for
a generic anharmonic system. These results are compared to active Brownian
particles inside a harmonic or anharmonic well. From this it can be shown that
accumulation of probability away from its equilibrium minima is a natural
effect arising in anharmonic but not harmonic systems. Finally, we extend the
microscopic results to study small active polymers with anharmonic backbone
potentials. The interplay of the active driving with the anharmonic backbone
potential can be used to understand how the end-to-end distance and mode space
distributions of anharmonic active polymers scales with active driving. In

weighted-sum average Age of Information (AoI) in the presence of correlation.
First, we discuss how to find optimal stationary randomized policies and show
that they are at-most a factor of two away from optimal policies in general.
Then, we develop a Lyapunov drift-based max-weight policy that performs better
than randomized policies in practice and show that it is also at-most a factor
of two away from optimal. Next, we derive scaling results that show how AoI
improves in large networks in the presence of correlation. We also show that
for stationary randomized policies, the expression for average AoI is robust to
the way in which the correlation structure is modeled. Finally, for the setting
where correlation parameters are unknown and time-varying, we develop a
heuristic policy that adapts its scheduling decisions by learning the
correlation parameters in an online manner. We also provide numerical
simulations to support our theoretical results.

parameters. Due to resource limitations, ``breadth-first'' high-throughput
experiments take only a few independent samples of each parameter, and so it is
challenging to assess estimator error. We propose a new model-free method for
bounding type S errors in this context, based on a quantity we call the
Cross-replicate Sign Error Rate (CSER). The CSER is the expected sign agreement
between a fixed set of estimates and estimates based on an independent
experimental replicate. To show the CSER can be estimated with enough accuracy
to be useful in practice, we develop new improvements to Hoeffding's bounds for
sums of bounded random variables, obtaining the tightest bounds that can be
obtained from the Chernoff inequality. We apply this method to analyzing
measurements from cell-perturbation experiments. Our method reveals that
existing error control practices fail to control error at their nominal level
in some cases and are needlessly conservative in others. The CSER is easy to
estimate, enabling practitioners to detect problems in their experimental
designs and identify subsets of parameters with a low proportion of type S
errors.

wireless channels due to the impurities of the propagation environments, such
as deep fading, blockages, etc., multiple RISs are deployed in the considered
IoT network to mitigate the propagation-induced impairments, to enhance the
quality of the wireless links, and to ensure that the required freshness of
information is achieved. In this setup, an optimization problem has been
formulated to minimize the average sum Age of Information (AoI) by optimizing
the transmit power of the IoTDs, the IoTDs clustering policy, and the RISs
configurations. The formulated problem ends up to be a mixed-integer non-convex
problem. In order to tackle this challenge, the RISs configurations are first
obtained by adopting a semi-definite relaxation (SDR) approach. Then, the joint
power allocation and user-clustering problem is solved using the concept of
bi-level optimization, where the original problem is decomposed into an outer
IoTDs clustering problem and an inner power allocation problem. Optimal
closed-form expressions are derived for the inner problem and the Hungarian
method is invoked to solve the outer problem. Numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed approach achieves lowest AoI compared to the other baseline
approaches.

affected many areas of human social interaction. These biases have been shown
to impact machine learning (ML) models, and for natural language processing

gender bias in information retrieval (IR) is important to avoid propagating
stereotypes. In this work, we employ a dataset consisting of two components:
(1) relevance of a document to a query and (2) ""gender"" of a document, in which
pronouns are replaced by male, female, and neutral conjugations. We
definitively show that pre-trained models for IR do not perform well in
zero-shot retrieval tasks when full fine-tuning of a large pre-trained BERT
encoder is performed and that lightweight fine-tuning performed with adapter
networks improves zero-shot retrieval performance almost by 20% over baseline.
We also illustrate that pre-trained models have gender biases that result in
retrieved articles tending to be more often male than female. We overcome this
by introducing a debiasing technique that penalizes the model when it prefers
males over females, resulting in an effective model that retrieves articles in
a balanced fashion across genders.

descriptors for interatomic potentials, tensor products of spherical harmonics
have been used to characterize complex atomic environments. When coupled with a
radial basis, the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) basis is obtained. However,
symmetrization with respect to both rotation and permutation results in an
overcomplete set of ACE descriptors with linear dependencies occurring within
blocks of functions corresponding to particular generalized Wigner symbols. All
practical applications of ACE employ semi-numerical constructions to generate a
complete, fully independent basis. While computationally tractable, the
resultant basis cannot be expressed analytically, is susceptible to numerical
instability, and thus has limited reproducibility. Here we present a procedure
for generating explicit analytic expressions for a complete and independent set
of ACE descriptors. The procedure uses a coupling scheme that is maximally
symmetric w.r.t. permutation of the atoms, exposing the permutational
symmetries of the generalized Wigner symbols, and yields a permutation-adapted
rotationally and permutationally invariant basis (PA-RPI ACE). Theoretical
support for the approach is presented, as well as numerical evidence of
completeness and independence. A summary of explicit enumeration of PA-RPI
functions up to rank 6 and polynomial degree 32 is provided. The PA-RPI blocks
corresponding to particular generalized Wigner symbols may be either larger or
smaller than the corresponding blocks in the simpler rotationally invariant
basis. Finally, we demonstrate that basis functions of high polynomial degree
persist under strong regularization, indicating the importance of not
restricting the maximum degree of basis functions in ACE models a priori.

RGB-D saliency detection that is robust to the low-quality depths which
primarily appear in two forms: inaccuracy due to noise and the misalignment to
RGB. To this end, we propose a robust RGB-D fusion method that benefits from
(1) layer-wise, and (2) trident spatial, attention mechanisms. On the one hand,
layer-wise attention (LWA) learns the trade-off between early and late fusion
of RGB and depth features, depending upon the depth accuracy. On the other
hand, trident spatial attention (TSA) aggregates the features from a wider
spatial context to address the depth misalignment problem. The proposed LWA and
TSA mechanisms allow us to efficiently exploit the multi-modal inputs for
saliency detection while being robust against low-quality depths. Our
experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed fusion

manipulation of magnetic textures. Here we theoretically study the effect of a
spin-polarized current on the magnetic texture corresponding to a chiral
soliton lattice in a monoaxial helimagnet under a transverse magnetic field. At
sufficiently small current density the chiral soliton lattice reaches a steady
motion state with a velocity proportional to the intensity of the applied
current, the mobility being independent of the density of solitons and the
magnetic field. This motion is accompanied with a small conical distortion of
the chiral soliton lattice. At large current density the spin-transfer torque
destabilizes the chiral soliton lattice, driving the system to a ferromagnetic
state parallel to the magnetic field. We analyze how the deformation of the
chiral soliton lattice depends on the applied current density. The destruction
of the chiral soliton lattice under current could serve as a possible erasure
mechanisms for spintronic applications.

materials. Indeed, the latter category has greatly expanded in the last decade
or so, with the discoveries of new forms of superfluidity in artificial
heterostructures and the exploitation of proximitization. The former category
continues to surprise through the Fe-based pnictides and chalcogenides, and
nickelates as well as others. It is the goal of this review to present this
two-pronged investigation into superconductors, with a focus on those which we
have come to understand belong somewhere between the BCS and Bose-Einstein

superfluidity in Fermi gases. In the process, we address the multiple ways of
promoting a system out of the BCS and into the BCS-BEC crossover regime within
the context of concrete experimental realizations. These involve natural
materials, such as organic conductors, as well as artificial, mostly
two-dimensional materials, such as magic-angle twisted bilayer and trilayer
graphene, or gate-controlled devices, as well as one-layer and interfacial
superconducting films. This work should be viewed as a celebration of BCS
theory by showing that even though this theory was initially implemented with
the special case of weak correlations in mind, it can in a very natural way be
extended to treat the case of these more exotic strongly correlated
superconductors.

(LTCs) and high dimensional expanders. Here, an LTC is called good if it has
constant rate and linear distance. Our emphasis in this work is on LTCs
testable with only $2$ queries, which are of particular interest to theoretical
computer science. This is done by introducing a new object called a sheaf that
is put on top of a high dimensional expander. Sheaves are vastly studied in
topology. Here, we introduce sheaves on simplicial complexes. Moreover, we
define a notion of an expanding sheaf that has not been studied before.
  We present a framework to get good infinite families of $2$-query LTCs from
expanding sheaves on high dimensional expanders, utilizing towers of coverings
of these high dimensional expanders. Starting with a high dimensional expander
and an expanding sheaf, our framework produces an infinite family of codes
admitting a $2$-query tester. We show that if the initial sheaved high
dimensional expander satisfies some conditions, which can be checked in
constant time, then these codes form a family of good $2$-query LTCs.
  We give candidates for sheaved high dimensional expanders which can be fed
into our framework, in the form of an iterative process which conjecturally
produces such candidates given a high dimensional expander and a special
auxiliary sheaf. (We could not verify the prerequisites of our framework for
these candidates directly because of computational limitations.) We analyse
this process experimentally and heuristically, and identify some properties of
the fundamental group of the high dimensional expander at hand which are
sufficient (but not necessary) to get the desired sheaf, and consequently an
infinite family of good $2$-query LTCs.

there is little experimental evidence to guide designers as to what is the
right amount of text to show within a chart, what its qualitative properties
should be, and where it should be placed. Prior work also shows variation in
personal preferences for charts versus textual representations. In this paper,
we explore several research questions about the relative value of textual
components of visualizations. 302 participants ranked univariate line charts
containing varying amounts of text, ranging from no text (except for the axes)
to a written paragraph with no visuals. Participants also described what
information they could take away from line charts containing text with varying
semantic content. We find that heavily annotated charts were not penalized. In
fact, participants preferred the charts with the largest number of textual
annotations over charts with fewer annotations or text alone. We also find
effects of semantic content. For instance, the text that describes statistical
or relational components of a chart leads to more takeaways referring to
statistics or relational comparisons than text describing elemental or encoded
components. Finally, we find different effects for the semantic levels based on
the placement of the text on the chart; some kinds of information are best
placed in the title, while others should be placed closer to the data. We
compile these results into four chart design guidelines and discuss future
implications for the combination of text and charts.

processes tasks according to the transmission order, the problem is NP-hard.
However, it is difficult for traditional optimization methods to quickly obtain
the optimal solution, while approaches based on reinforcement learning face
with the challenge of excessively large action space and slow convergence. In
this paper, we propose a Digital Twin (DT)-assisted RL-based task scheduling
method in order to improve the performance and convergence of the RL. We use DT
to simulate the results of different decisions made by the agent, so that one
agent can try multiple actions at a time, or, similarly, multiple agents can
interact with environment in parallel in DT. In this way, the exploration
efficiency of RL can be significantly improved via DT, and thus RL can
converges faster and local optimality is less likely to happen. Particularly,
two algorithms are designed to made task scheduling decisions, i.e.,
DT-assisted asynchronous Q-learning (DTAQL) and DT-assisted exploring
Q-learning (DTEQL). Simulation results show that both algorithms significantly
improve the convergence speed of Q-learning by increasing the exploration

resulted in significant dispersion of MW levels within metropolitan areas. In
this paper, we study the effect of MW changes on local housing rental markets
exploiting the placed-based nature of MW policies. For each location we define
both the log MW where the average resident works (the ""workplace MW"") and the
log MW in the location itself (the ""residence MW""). We derive a
partial-equilibrium model of a housing market in which MW levels in each
location affect housing demand by changing the income of commuters and the
prices of non-tradable consumption. The model shows that the workplace MW has a
positive effect on rents whereas the residence MW has a negative effect. We
construct a ZIP code by month panel using rents data from Zillow, and use a
difference-in-differences design to estimate the effect of residence and
workplace MW changes on median housing rents. Our baseline results imply that a
10 percent increase in the workplace MW and no change in the residence MW will
increase rents by 0.69 percent (SE=0.29). If the residence MW also increases by
10 percent, then rents will increase by 0.47 percent (SE=0.16). We use our
results to study the incidence of two counterfactual MW policies: a federal MW
increase and a city MW increase. We estimate that landlords pocket 9.2 and 11.0
cents for every dollar increase in worker income in areas affected by these
policies. However, the incidence varies systematically across space.

Thus, the theory of regular Lagrangian flows cannot be applied to construct the

strategy is applicable even if some subsystems are regarded as black boxes,
requiring only twists and wrenches at the connection points between them. To

displayed dramatic, systematic variations in intensity, velocity width,

indicate that the host galaxy contains a pseudobulge and a total stellar mass
of $3.56_{-0.35}^{+0.38} \times 10^{9}\, M_\odot$. Enhanced continuum radiation
from the outburst produced an accretion disk wind, which condensed into BLR
clouds in the region above and below the temporary eccentric disk. Broad Balmer
lines emerged $\sim 100$ days after the outburst, together with an unexpected,
additional component of narrow-line emission. The newly formed BLR clouds then
traveled along a similar eccentric orbit ($e \approx 0.6$). The Balmer
decrement of the BLR increased by a factor of $\sim 4-5$ as a result of secular
changes in cloud density. The drop in density at late times allowed the
production of \hei\ and \heii\ emission. The mass of the black hole cannot be
derived from the broad emission lines because the BLR is not virialized.
Instead, we use the stellar properties of the host galaxy to estimate
$M_\mathrm{BH} = 1.38_{-0.66}^{+1.25} \times 10^{6}\, M_\odot$. The nucleus

Amplification can be achieved with a linear Markovian CPTP channel by placing

However, although several diagnosis systems have already achieved acceptable
performance in diagnosis precision and speed, hardly have the researchers
discussed the method of monitoring point choosing and its layout. For this
reason, redundant measuring data are used to train the diagnostic model,
leading to high uncertainty of the classification, extra training time
consumption, and higher probability of overfitting while training. In this
study, a method of choosing thermal hydraulics parameters of a nuclear power
plant is proposed, using the theory of post-hoc interpretability theory in deep
learning. At the start, a novel Time-sequential Residual Convolutional Neural
Network (TRES-CNN) diagnosis model is introduced to identify the position and
hydrodynamic diameter of breaks in LOCA, using 38 parameters manually chosen on

to evaluate the attributions of diagnosis model's outputs, deciding which 15
parameters to be more decisive in diagnosing LOCA details. The results show
that the TRES-CNN based diagnostic model successfully predicts the position and
size of breaks in LOCA via selected 15 parameters of HPR1000, with 25% of time
consumption while training the model compared the process using total 38
parameters. In addition, the relative diagnostic accuracy error is within 1.5
percent compared with the model using parameters chosen empirically, which can
be regarded as the same amount of diagnostic reliability.

explored the power of global simulation envelope tests constructed around data
on quantile-quantile plots, or around trend lines on residual vs fits plots or
scale-location plots. Global envelope tests compared favorably to commonly used
tests of assumptions at detecting violations of distributional and linearity

dimensionality reduction strategy are introduced in a unified networked
framework to lighten the communication burden. Then, two kinds of compensation
strategies in terms of a unified model are designed to restructure the
untransmitted information, and the local/fusion estimators are proposed based
on the compensation information. Furthermore, the linearization errors caused
by the Taylor expansion are modeled by the state-dependent matrices with
uncertain parameters when establishing estimation error systems, and then
different robust recursive optimization problems are constructed to determine
the estimator gains and the fusion criteria. Meanwhile, the stability
conditions are also proposed such that the square errors of the designed

their performance suffers from insufficient human-labeled question-answer (QA)
pairs. However, we observe that, in general, the scene text is not fully
exploited in the existing datasets -- only a small portion of the text in each
image participates in the annotated QA activities. This results in a huge waste
of useful information. To address this deficiency, we develop a new method to
generate high-quality and diverse QA pairs by explicitly utilizing the existing
rich text available in the scene context of each image. Specifically, we
propose, TAG, a text-aware visual question-answer generation architecture that
learns to produce meaningful, and accurate QA samples using a multimodal
transformer. The architecture exploits underexplored scene text information and
enhances scene understanding of Text-VQA models by combining the generated QA
pairs with the initial training data. Extensive experimental results on two
well-known Text-VQA benchmarks (TextVQA and ST-VQA) demonstrate that our
proposed TAG effectively enlarges the training data that helps improve the
Text-VQA performance without extra labeling effort. Moreover, our model
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches that are pre-trained with extra

sentence completion, retrieval-based sentence completion, and phrase

JWST/NIRCam observations. Due to the (redshifted) break produced by neutral
hydrogen absorption of rest-frame UV photons, these sources are expected to
drop out in the bluer filters while being well detected in redder filters.
However, here we show that dust-enshrouded star-forming galaxies at lower
redshifts (z<7) may also mimic the near-infrared (near-IR) colors of z>10 LBGs,
representing potential contaminants in LBG candidate samples. First, we analyze
CEERS-DSFG-1, a NIRCam dropout undetected in the F115W and F150W filters but
detected at longer wavelengths. Combining the JWST data with (sub)millimeter
constraints, including deep NOEMA interferometric observations, we show that
this source is a dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) at z~5.1. We also present a
tentative 2.6sigma SCUBA-2 detection at 850um around a recently identified z~16
LBG candidate in the same field and show that, if the emission is real and
associated with this candidate, the available photometry is consistent with a
z~5 dusty galaxy with strong nebular emission lines despite its blue near-IR
colors. Further observations on this candidate are imperative to mitigate the
low confidence of this tentative submillimeter emission and its positional
uncertainty. Our analysis shows that robust (sub)millimeter detections of
NIRCam dropout galaxies likely imply z=4-6 redshift solutions, where the
observed near-IR break would be the result of a strong rest-frame optical
Balmer break combined with high dust attenuation and strong nebular line
emission, rather than the rest-frame UV Lyman break. This provides evidence
that DSFGs may contaminate searches for ultra high-redshift LBG candidates from
JWST observations.

contourlet network consisting of a convolutional neural network and a
contourlet transform branch. In the encoder stage, we design a spatial-spectral
fusion module to effectively fuse two types of cues. Contrary to the encoder,
we employ the inverse contourlet transform with learned low-pass subbands and
band-pass directional subbands to compose the depth in the decoder. Experiments

emerging attention as a practical attack scenario, where the attacker injects
malicious nodes instead of modifying node features or edges to degrade the
performance of GNNs. Despite the initial success of node injection attacks, we
find that the injected nodes by existing methods are easy to be distinguished
from the original normal nodes by defense methods and limiting their attack
performance in practice. To solve the above issues, we devote to camouflage
node injection attack, i.e., camouflaging injected malicious nodes
(structure/attributes) as the normal ones that appear legitimate/imperceptible
to defense methods. The non-Euclidean nature of graph data and the lack of
human prior brings great challenges to the formalization, implementation, and
evaluation of camouflage on graphs. In this paper, we first propose and
formulate the camouflage of injected nodes from both the fidelity and diversity
of the ego networks centered around injected nodes. Then, we design an
adversarial CAmouflage framework for Node injection Attack, namely CANA, to
improve the camouflage while ensuring the attack performance. Several novel
indicators for graph camouflage are further designed for a comprehensive
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that when equipping existing node
injection attack methods with our proposed CANA framework, the attack
performance against defense methods as well as node camouflage is significantly
improved.

domains. However, the majority of existing link prediction approaches assume
the given graph follows homophily assumption, and designs similarity-based
heuristics or representation learning approaches to predict links. However,
many real-world graphs are heterophilic graphs, where the homophily assumption
does not hold, which challenges existing link prediction methods. Generally, in
heterophilic graphs, there are many latent factors causing the link formation,
and two linked nodes tend to be similar in one or two factors but might be
dissimilar in other factors, leading to low overall similarity. Thus, one way
is to learn disentangled representation for each node with each vector
capturing the latent representation of a node on one factor, which paves a way
to model the link formation in heterophilic graphs, resulting in better node
representation learning and link prediction performance. However, the work on
this is rather limited. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of
exploring disentangled representation learning for link prediction on
heterophilic graphs. We propose a novel framework DisenLink which can learn
disentangled representations by modeling the link formation and perform
factor-aware message-passing to facilitate link prediction. Extensive

a novel Nussbaum gain technique and some positive integrable function into the

current state-of-art controllability condition is further relaxed, which
enlarges the class of systems that can be considered in the proposed control
scheme. All the closed-loop signals are ensured to be globally ultimately
uniformly bounded. Moreover, such control methodology is further extended to
the case involving intermittent actuator faults, with application to robotic
systems. Finally, simulation studies are carried out to demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of this method.

large number of experiments were implemented on the LoRa devices in the real

results demonstrate the following main phenomena. (1) Compared to other
lightweight transmission-parameter selection schemes, collisions between LoRa
devices can be efficiently avoided by our proposed scheme in LoRaWAN
irrespective of changes in the available channels. (2) The frame success rate

  Enhancement",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Motivated by the ever-increasing concerns on personal data privacy and the
rapidly growing data volume at local clients, federated learning (FL) has
emerged as a new machine learning setting. An FL system is comprised of a
central parameter server and multiple local clients. It keeps data at local
clients and learns a centralized model by sharing the model parameters learned
locally. No local data needs to be shared, and privacy can be well protected.
Nevertheless, since it is the model instead of the raw data that is shared, the
system can be exposed to the poisoning model attacks launched by malicious
clients. Furthermore, it is challenging to identify malicious clients since no
local client data is available on the server. Besides, membership inference
attacks can still be performed by using the uploaded model to estimate the
client's local data, leading to privacy disclosure. In this work, we first
propose a model update based federated averaging algorithm to defend against
Byzantine attacks such as additive noise attacks and sign-flipping attacks. The
individual client model initialization method is presented to provide further
privacy protections from the membership inference attacks by hiding the
individual local machine learning model. When combining these two schemes,
privacy and security can be both effectively enhanced. The proposed schemes are
proved to converge experimentally under non-IID data distribution when there
are no attacks. Under Byzantine attacks, the proposed schemes perform much
better than the classical model based FedAvg algorithm.

unfolding network (DUN) has attracted much attention in recent years for image
compressed sensing (CS). However, there still exist several issues in existing
DUNs: 1) For each iteration, a simple stacked convolutional network is usually
adopted, which apparently limits the expressiveness of these models. 2) Once
the training is completed, most hyperparameters of existing DUNs are fixed for
any input content, which significantly weakens their adaptability. In this
paper, by unfolding the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm
(FISTA), a novel fast hierarchical DUN, dubbed FHDUN, is proposed for image
compressed sensing, in which a well-designed hierarchical unfolding
architecture is developed to cooperatively explore richer contextual prior
information in multi-scale spaces. To further enhance the adaptability, series
of hyperparametric generation networks are developed in our framework to
dynamically produce the corresponding optimal hyperparameters according to the
input content. Furthermore, due to the accelerated policy in FISTA, the newly
embedded acceleration module makes the proposed FHDUN save more than 50% of the
iterative loops against recent DUNs. Extensive CS experiments manifest that the
proposed FHDUN outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS methods, while
maintaining fewer iterations.

decomposed to give hydrogen and low-molecular-weight alkanes (CH4 and C2H6),

remaining carbon atoms without C-H bonds accumulate and nucleate to form
diamond crystals. The process of diamond growth is found to associated with a

Graph Generation (WSSGG). The mainstream solution for WSSGG typically follows
the same pipeline: they first align text entities in the weak image-level
supervisions (e.g., unlocalized relation triplets or captions) with image
regions, and then train SGG models in a fully-supervised manner with aligned
instance-level ""pseudo"" labels. However, we argue that most existing WSSGG
works only focus on object-consistency, which means the grounded regions should
have the same object category label as text entities. While they neglect
another basic requirement for an ideal alignment: interaction-consistency,
which means the grounded region pairs should have the same interactions (i.e.,
visual relations) as text entity pairs. Hence, in this paper, we propose to
enhance a simple grounding module with both object-aware and interaction-aware
knowledge to acquire more reliable pseudo labels. To better leverage these two
types of knowledge, we regard them as two teachers and fuse their generated
targets to guide the training process of our grounding module. Specifically, we
design two different strategies to adaptively assign weights to different
teachers by assessing their reliability on each training sample. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated that our method consistently improves WSSGG

residual blocks, namely EMC2A blocks with multiscale receptive fields(RFs),
based on a multibranch structure and then designed an efficient isotopic
architecture deep CNN (DCNN), EMC2A-Net. EMC2A blocks utilize parallel dilated
convolution with different dilation rates, which can effectively capture
multiscale context features without significantly increasing the computational
burden. To further improve the efficiency of multiscale feature fusion, this
paper proposed a multiscale feature cross-channel attention module, namely the
EMC2A module, adopting a local multiscale feature interaction strategy without
dimensionality reduction. This strategy adaptively adjusts the weights of each
channel through efficient one-dimensional (1D)-circular convolution and sigmoid
function to guide attention at the global channel wise level. The comparative
results on the MSTAR dataset show that EMC2A-Net outperforms the existing

the two-fluid model of superfluid helium-4 based on smoothed-particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) is equivalent to solving a many-body quantum mechanical
equation under specific conditions. This study further verifies the existence
of this equivalence. First, we derived the SPH form of the motion equation for
the superfluid component of the two-fluid model, i.e., the motion equation
driven by the chemical potential gradient obtained using the Gibbs-Duhem
equation. We then derived the SPH form of the motion equation for condensates
based on the Gross-Pitaevskii theory, i.e., the motion equation driven by the
chemical potential gradient obtained from the Schrodinger equation of
interacting bosons. Following this, we compared the two discretized equations.
Consequently, we discovered that a condition maintaining zero internal energy
for each fluid particle ensures the equivalence of the equations when the
quantum pressure is negligible. Moreover, their equivalence holds even when the
quantum pressure is nonnegligible if the quantum pressure gradient force equals
the mutual friction force. A zero internal energy indicates the thermodynamic
ground state, which includes an elementary excitation state. Therefore, the
condition can be sufficiently satisfied when the velocities of fluid particles
do not exceed the Landau critical velocity, which is not a stringent condition
for simulations with a characteristic velocity of a few cms-1 in a laboratory
system. Based on the above, we performed a simulation of rotating liquid
helium-4 and succeeded in generating a vortex lattice with quantized
circulation, known as a quantum lattice.

obtained by perturbing the diagonal elements of the Wigner matrix. The
eigenvector $\mathbf{x}_{\rm min}$ of the minimal eigenvalue $\lambda_{\rm

certain types of perturbations and in the limit of the large components, this
condensation becomes a sharp phase transition, the mechanism of which can be
identified with the Bose-Einstein condensation in a mathematical level. We
study this Bose-Einstein like condensation phenomenon by means of the replica

statistical properties of $\mathbf{x}_{\rm min}$. Then, we apply the formula
for two solvable cases: when the distribution of the perturbation has the
double peak, and when it has a continuous distribution. For the double peak, we
find that at the transition point, the participation ratio changes
discontinuously from a finite value to zero. On the contrary, in the case of a
continuous distribution, the participation ratio goes to zero either
continuously or discontinuously, depending on the distribution.

exhibited by the multiple types of behaviors, effectively modeling complex
behavior dependencies is crucial for multi-behavior prediction. The
state-of-the-art multi-behavior models learn behavior dependencies
indistinguishably with all historical interactions as input. However, different
behaviors may reflect different aspects of user preference, which means that
some irrelevant interactions may play as noises to the target behavior to be
predicted. To address the aforementioned limitations, we introduce
multi-interest learning to the multi-behavior recommendation. More
specifically, we propose a novel Coarse-to-fine Knowledge-enhanced
Multi-interest Learning (CKML) framework to learn shared and behavior-specific
interests for different behaviors. CKML introduces two advanced modules, namely
Coarse-grained Interest Extracting (CIE) and Fine-grained Behavioral
Correlation (FBC), which work jointly to capture fine-grained behavioral
dependencies. CIE uses knowledge-aware information to extract initial
representations of each interest. FBC incorporates a dynamic routing scheme to
further assign each behavior among interests. Additionally, we use the
self-attention mechanism to correlate different behavioral information at the
interest level. Empirical results on three real-world datasets verify the
effectiveness and efficiency of our model in exploiting multi-behavior data.
Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each module and the
robustness and superiority of the shared and specific modelling paradigm for

appropriately weighted. For demonstration, the experiments are conducted with
Graph convolutional neural network(GCNN) architecture, however, the proposed

conversion of the initial current to a relativistic runaway electron beam.
Validated predictive tools are required to optimize the scenarios and
mitigation actuators to avoid the excessive damage that can be caused by such
events. Many of the simulation tools applied in fusion energy research require
the user to specify several input parameters that are not constrained by the
available experimental information. Hence, a typical validation exercise
requires multiparameter optimization to calibrate the uncertain input
parameters for the best possible representation of the investigated physical
system. The conventional approach, where an expert modeler conducts the
parameter calibration based on domain knowledge, is prone to lead to an
intractable validation challenge. For a typical simulation, conducting
exhaustive multiparameter investigations manually to ensure a globally optimal
solution and to rigorously quantify the uncertainties is an unattainable task,
typically covered only partially and unsystematically. Bayesian inference
algorithms offer a promising alternative approach that naturally includes
uncertainty quantification and is less subjective to user bias in choosing the
input parameters. The main challenge in using these methods is the
computational cost of simulating enough samples to construct the posterior
distributions for the uncertain input parameters. This challenge can be
overcome by combining probabilistic surrogate modelling, such as Gaussian
Process regression, with Bayesian optimization, which can reduce the number of
required simulations by several orders of magnitude. Here, we implement this
type of Bayesian optimization framework for a model for analysis of disruption
runaway electrons, and explore for simulations of current quench in a JET
plasma discharge with an argon induced disruption.

This leads to questions about whether such deviations are physical or
numerical; code validation studies are important and necessary tools for
studying these questions. We provide the first direct comparison between the
Monash stellar evolution program and MESA for a $2M_{\odot}$ model evolved from
the zero-age main sequence to the tip of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant
branch. We compare the internal structure of the two models at six critical
evolutionary points and find that they are in excellent agreement in
characteristics like central temperature, central density and the temperature
at the base of the convective envelope during the thermally pulsing asymptotic
giant branch. The hydrogen-exhausted core mass between the models differs by
less than 4.2% throughout the entire evolution, the final values vary only by
1.5%. Surface quantities such as luminosity and radius vary by less than 0.2%
prior to the asymptotic giant branch. During thermal pulses, the difference
extends to 3.4%, largely due to uncertainties in mixing and the treatment of
atmospheric boundary conditions. Given that the veteran Monash code is closed
source, the present work provides the first fully open-source computational
analog. This increases accessibility to precision modeling on the asymptotic

highly expressive, deep neural networks are black-box models, making their

In this paper, we introduce a structured way of forecasting the movement of
opposing racecars with deep neural networks. The resulting set of possible
output trajectories is constrained. Hence quality guarantees about the
prediction can be given. We report the performance of the model by evaluating
it together with an LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture on data acquired

outperforms the baseline regarding the prediction accuracy but still fulfills
the quality guarantees. Thus, a robust real-world application of the model is
proven. The presented model was deployed on the racecar of the Technical

is used to implement a non-transversal logical CNOT gate between two five qubit

which are provided by including quantum error correction circuit primitives
known as flagging and pieceable fault tolerance. In the second instance, a

decoding, are implemented during runtime using a classical compute environment
that is tightly integrated with the quantum processor. For different
combinations of the primitives, logical state fidelity measurements are made
after applying the gate to different input states, providing bounds on the
process fidelity. We find the highest fidelity operations with the color code,
with the fault-tolerant SPAM operation achieving fidelities of 0.99939(15) and
0.99959(13) when preparing eigenstates of the logical X and Z operators, which
is higher than the average physical qubit SPAM fidelities of 0.9968(2) and

logical transversal CNOT gate, we find the color code to perform the
sequence--state preparation, CNOT, measure out--with an average fidelity
bounded by [0.9957,0.9963]. The logical fidelity bounds are higher than the
analogous physical-level fidelity bounds, which we find to be [0.9850,0.9903],

quantity with model complexity. Tools such as identifiability analysis and

cannot always resolve the mismatch between available data and the granularity
required in mathematical models to answer important biological questions.
Often, it is only simple phenomenological models, such as the logistic and
Gompertz growth models, that are identifiable from standard experimental
measurements. To draw insights from the complex, non-identifiable models that
incorporate key biological mechanisms of interest, we study the geometry of a
map in parameter space from the complex model to a simple, identifiable,
surrogate model. By studying how non-identifiable parameters in the complex
model quantitatively relate to identifiable parameters in surrogate, we
introduce and exploit a layer of interpretation between the set of
non-identifiable parameters and the goodness-of-fit metric or likelihood
studied in typical identifiability analysis. We demonstrate our approach by
analysing a hierarchy of mathematical models for multicellular tumour spheroid
growth. Typical data from tumour spheroid experiments are limited and noisy,
and corresponding mathematical models are very often made arbitrarily complex.
Our geometric approach is able to predict non-identifiabilities, subset
non-identifiable parameter spaces into identifiable parameter combinations that
relate to individual data features, and overall provide additional biological

lower bound of the secrecy rate and derive a first-order Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
(KKT) condition to identify local optimal solutions with respect to the
precoders. Interpreting the condition as a generalized eigenvalue problem, we
solve the problem by using a power iteration-based method. In the second phase,
we adopt a weighted-sum approach and derive KKT conditions in terms of the

provides better fuel efficiency in a combustion system. However, approaching
towards lean combustion can make engines more susceptible to lean blowout. Lean
blowout (LBO) is an undesirable phenomenon that can cause sudden flame
extinction leading to sudden loss of power. During the design stage, it is
quite challenging for the scientists to accurately determine the optimal
operating limits to avoid sudden LBO occurrence. Therefore, it is crucial to
develop accurate and computationally tractable frameworks for online LBO
detection in low NOx emission engines. To the best of our knowledge, for the
first time, we propose a deep learning approach to detect lean blowout in
combustion systems. In this work, we utilize a laboratory-scale combustor to
collect data for different protocols. We start far from LBO for each protocol
and gradually move towards the LBO regime, capturing a quasi-static time series
dataset at each condition. Using one of the protocols in our dataset as the
reference protocol and with conditions annotated by domain experts, we find a
transition state metric for our trained deep learning model to detect LBO in
the other test protocols. We find that our proposed approach is more accurate
and computationally faster than other baseline models to detect the transitions
to LBO. Therefore, we recommend this method for real-time performance
monitoring in lean combustion engines.

gauge for spacetime configurations where the both the metric and connection are
static and spherically symmetric, and write out the respective form of the
coincident gauge metrics. Taking different options in fixing the freedom in the
connection allowed by the symmetry and the field equations, the Schwarzschild
metric in the coincident gauge can take for instance the Cartesian,
Kerr-Schild, and diagonal (isotropic-like) forms, while the BBMB black hole
metric in symmetric teleparallel scalar-tensor theory a certain diagonal form
fits the coincident gauge requirements but the Cartesian and Kerr-Schild forms
do not. Different connections imply different value for the boundary term which

  Vertex Domain Filtering",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper provides a new strategy for the Heterogeneous Change Detection
(HCD) problem: solving HCD from the perspective of Graph Signal Processing
(GSP). We construct a graph for each image to capture the structure
information, and treat each image as the graph signal. In this way, we convert
the HCD into a GSP problem: a comparison of the responses of the two signals on
different systems defined on the two graphs, which attempts to find structural
differences (Part I) and signal differences (Part II) due to the changes
between heterogeneous images. In this first part, we analyze the HCD with GSP
from the vertex domain. We first show that for the unchanged images, their
structures are consistent, and then the outputs of the same signal on systems
defined on the two graphs are similar. However, once a region has changed, the
local structure of the image changes, i.e., the connectivity of the vertex
containing this region changes. Then, we can compare the output signals of the
same input graph signal passing through filters defined on the two graphs to
detect changes. We design different filters from the vertex domain, which can
flexibly explore the high-order neighborhood information hidden in original
graphs. We also analyze the detrimental effects of changing regions on the
change detection results from the viewpoint of signal propagation. Experiments
conducted on seven real data sets show the effectiveness of the vertex domain
filtering based HCD method.

as indicated by observed superluminal radio blobs. The energy source of these
jets is widely discussed in the theoretical framework of Blandford-Znajek
process, the electromagnetic energy extraction from rotating black holes (BHs),
while formation mechanism of the radio blobs in the
electromagnetically-dominated jets has been a long-standing problem. Recent
high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetically arrested disks
exhibited magnetic reconnection in a transient magnetically-dominated part of
the equatorial disk near the BH horizon, which led to a promising scenario of
efficient MeV gamma-ray production and subsequent electron-positron pair
loading into BH magnetosphere. We develop this scenario to build a theoretical
framework on energetics, timescales and particle number density of the
superluminal radio blobs and discuss observable signatures in other wavebands.
We analytically show that the non-thermal electrons emit broadband photons from
optical to multi-MeV bands. The electron-positron pairs produced in the
magnetosphere are optically thick for synchrotron-self absorption, so that the
injected energy is stored in the plasma. The stored energy is enough to power
the superluminal radio blobs observed in M87. This scenario predicts rather dim
radio blobs around Sgr A*, which are consistent with no clear detection by
current facilities. In addition, this scenario inevitably produces strong X-ray
flares in a short timescale, which will be detectable by future X-ray
satellites.

a need for a new design for wind power systems to be able to fulfil the black

challenges, and possible solutions in integrating BS services into OWFs will be
presented. A first challenge is represented by the implementation of a BS unit.
The BS unit should be capable of firstly forming the wind farm power island and
withstanding transient phenomena due to energisation. There could be several
different solutions, e.g., the integration of grid-forming converters in the
wind farm design which could be battery energy storage systems (BESSs). In this
paper, specific challenges are analysed using simulations on a wind farm
equipped with a grid-forming BESS, and the proposed solutions discussed. It can
be concluded that a hybrid system comprised of a BESS and an OWF, in

gravitationally unstable to structure formation as evidenced by the existence
of molecular clouds and ongoing star formation. This paper adopts a 3D
perspective to obtain a general picture of instabilities in flattened rotating
disks, using the 3D dispersion relation to describe how disks evolve when
perturbed over their vertical extents. By explicitly adding a vertical
perturbation to an unperturbed equilibrium disk, stability is shown to vary
with height above the mid-plane. Near to $z$=0 where the equilibrium density is
roughly constant, instability takes on a Jeans-like quality, occurring on
scales larger than the Jeans length and subject to a threshold
$Q_M=\kappa^2/(4\pi G\rho)=1$ or roughly $Q_T\approx 2$. Far from the
mid-plane, on the other hand, stability is pervasive, and the threshold for the
total disk (out to $z=\pm\infty$) to be stabilized is lowered to $Q_T=1$ as a
consequence. In this new framework, gas disks are able to fragment through
partial 3D instability even where total 2D instability is suppressed. The
growth rates of the fragments formed via 3D instability are comparable to, or
faster than, Toomre instabilities. The rich structure in molecular disks on the
scale of 10s of pc can thus be viewed as a natural consequence of their 3D
nature and their exposure to a variety of vertical perturbations acting on
roughly a disk scale height, i.e. due to their situation within the more
extended galaxy potential, participation in the disk-halo flow, and exposure to
star formation feedback.

also are influenced by the user's previous behaviors (e.g., clicks, purchases)

are likely to click frequently but purchase periodically. To this end, we
develop a new multi-scale user behavior network named Hierarchical rEcurrent
Ranking On the Entire Space (HEROES) which incorporates the contextual

Concretely, we introduce a hierarchical framework, where the lower layer models

satisfaction behaviors. The proposed architecture can automatically learn a
suitable time scale for each layer to capture the dynamic user's behavioral

form a novel recurrent unit which can not only encode the items' features in

unbiased ranking systems through combinations with the survival analysis

provides a resolution of 0.01 pc even in its most compact configuration. For
abundant molecules, such as HCO+, NH3, N2H+, and CO isotopomers, cloud

usually transmit data to a road side unit (RSU) at the network edge to process
data. However, vehicles are usually reluctant to share data with each other due
to the privacy issue. For the traditional federated learning (FL), vehicles
train the data locally to obtain a local model and then upload the local model
to the RSU to update the global model, thus the data privacy can be protected
through sharing model parameters instead of data. The traditional FL updates
the global model synchronously, i.e., the RSU needs to wait for all vehicles to
upload their models for the global model updating. However, vehicles may
usually drive out of the coverage of the RSU before they obtain their local
models through training, which reduces the accuracy of the global model. It is
necessary to propose an asynchronous federated learning (AFL) to solve this
problem, where the RSU updates the global model once it receives a local model
from a vehicle. However, the amount of data, computing capability and vehicle
mobility may affect the accuracy of the global model. In this paper, we jointly
consider the amount of data, computing capability and vehicle mobility to
design an AFL scheme to improve the accuracy of the global model. Extensive

distance from the star. We developed a model for the growth of a large
planetesimal (embryo) embedded in a population of smaller planetesimals formed
in a filament by the streaming instability. The model includes in a
self-consistent way the collisional mass growth of the embryo, the
fragmentation of the planetesimals, the velocity evolution of all involved
bodies, as well as the viscous spreading of the filament. We find that the
embryo accretes all available material in the filament during the lifetime of
the protoplanetary disc only in the inner regions of the disc. In contrast, we
find little or no growth in the outer parts of the disc beyond 5--10 AU.
Overall, our results demonstrate very long timescales for collisional growth of
planetesimals in the regions of the protoplanetary disc where giant planets
form. As such, in order to form giant planets in cold orbits, pebble accretion

decomposes the source signal into the regressed signal and changed signal, and
requires the regressed signal have the same spectral property as the target

proposed regression model is flexible and scalable. Experiments conducted on

has become the most popular scaling solution for the Bitcoin blockchain. The
security of the LN hinges on the ability of the nodes to close a channel by
settling their balances, which requires confirming a transaction on the Bitcoin
blockchain within a pre-agreed time period. This inherent timing restriction
that the LN must satisfy, make it susceptible to attacks that seek to increase
the congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain, thus preventing correct protocol
execution. We study the susceptibility of the LN to \emph{mass exit} attacks,
in the presence of a small coalition of adversarial nodes. This is a scenario
where an adversary forces a large set of honest protocol participants to
interact with the blockchain. We focus on two types of attacks: (i) The first
is a \emph{zombie} attack, where a set of $k$ nodes become unresponsive with
the goal to lock the funds of many channels for a period of time longer than
what the LN protocol dictates. (ii) The second is a \emph{mass double-spend}
attack, where a set of $k$ nodes attempt to steal funds by submitting many
closing transactions that settle channels using expired protocol states; this
causes many honest nodes to have to quickly respond by submitting invalidating
transactions. We show via simulations that, under historically-plausible
congestion conditions, with mild statistical assumptions on channel balances,
both of the attacks can be performed by a very small coalition. To perform our
simulations, we formulate the problem of finding a worst-case coalition of $k$
adversarial nodes as a graph cut problem. Our experimental findings are
supported by a theoretical justification based on the scale-free topology of
the LN.

predicate categories and fail to recognize rare ones due to the severe
imbalanced distribution of predicates. To improve the robustness of SGG models
on different predicate categories, recent research has focused on unbiased SGG
and adopted mean Recall@K (mR@K) as the main evaluation metric. However, we
discovered two overlooked issues about this de facto standard metric, which
makes current unbiased SGG evaluation vulnerable and unfair: 1) mR@K neglects
the correlations among predicates and unintentionally breaks category
independence when ranking all the triplet predictions together regardless of
the predicate categories. 2) mR@K neglects the compositional diversity of
different predicates and assigns excessively high weights to some oversimple
category samples with limited composable relation triplet types. In addition,
we investigate the under-explored correlation between objects and predicates,
which can serve as a simple but strong baseline for unbiased SGG. In this
paper, we refine mR@K and propose two complementary evaluation metrics for
unbiased SGG: Independent Mean Recall (MR) and weighted IMR (wIMR). These two
metrics are designed by considering the category independence and diversity of
composable relation triplets, respectively. We compare the proposed metrics
with the de facto standard metrics through extensive experiments and discuss
the solutions to evaluate unbiased SGG in a more trustworthy way.

example, while simulations are an excellent way of economical data collection,
a Synthetic-to-Real domain shift leads to a > 60% drop in accuracy when
recognizing activities of Daily Living (ADLs). We tackle this challenge and
introduce an activity domain generation framework which creates novel ADL
appearances (novel domains) from different existing activity modalities (source
domains) inferred from video training data. Our framework computes human poses,
heatmaps of body joints, and optical flow maps and uses them alongside the
original RGB videos to learn the essence of source domains in order to generate
completely new ADL domains. The model is optimized by maximizing the distance
between the existing source appearances and the generated novel appearances
while ensuring that the semantics of an activity is preserved through an
additional classification loss. While source data multimodality is an important
concept in this design, our setup does not rely on multi-sensor setups, (i.e.,
all source modalities are inferred from a single video only.) The newly created
activity domains are then integrated in the training of the ADL classification
networks, resulting in models far less susceptible to changes in data
distributions. Extensive experiments on the Synthetic-to-Real benchmark
Sims4Action demonstrate the potential of the domain generation paradigm for
cross-domain ADL recognition, setting new state-of-the-art results. Our code is

quantitative formulation of this principle within networks. We say that a
network is homophillic with respect to a given labeled partition of its
vertices, when the classes of the partition induce subgraphs that are
significantly denser than what we expect under a random labeled partition into
classes maintaining the same cardinalities (type). This is the recently
introduced \emph{random coloring model} for network homophily. In this
perspective, the vector whose entries are the sizes of the subgraphs induced by
the corresponding classes, is viewed as the observed outcome of the random
vector described by picking labeled partitions at random among partitions with
the same type.\,Consequently, the input network is homophillic at the
significance level $\alpha$ whenever the one-sided tail probability of
observing an outcome at least as extreme as the observed one, is smaller than
$\alpha$. Clearly, $\alpha$ can also be thought of as a quantifier of homophily
in the scale $[0,1]$. Since, as we show, even approximating this tail
probability is an NP-hard problem, we resort multidimensional extensions of
classical Cantelli's inequality to bound $\alpha$ from above. This upper bound
is the homophily index we propose. It requires the knowledge of the covariance
matrix of the random vector, which was not previously known within the random
coloring model. In this paper we close this gap by computing the covariance
matrix of subgraph sizes under the random coloring model. Interestingly, the
matrix depends on the input partition only through its type and on the network
only through its degrees. Furthermore all the covariances have the same sign
and this sign is a graph invariant. Plugging this structure into Cantelli's
bound yields a meaningful, easy to compute index for measuring network
homophily.

recent advances in machine learning. The purpose of the paper is to discuss the
potential advantages of gene recommendation performed by artificial
intelligence (AI). Indeed, gene recommendation engines try to solve this
problem: if the user is interested in a set of genes, which other genes are
likely to be related to the starting set and should be investigated? This task
was solved with a custom deep learning recommendation engine, DeepProphet2
(DP2), which is freely available to researchers worldwide via
https://www.generecommender.com?utm_source=DeepProphet2_paper&utm_medium=pdf.
Hereafter, insights behind the algorithm and its practical applications are
illustrated.
  The gene recommendation problem can be addressed by mapping the genes to a
metric space where a distance can be defined to represent the real semantic
distance between them. To achieve this objective a transformer-based model has
been trained on a well-curated freely available paper corpus, PubMed. The paper
describes multiple optimization procedures that were employed to obtain the
best bias-variance trade-off, focusing on embedding size and network depth. In
this context, the model's ability to discover sets of genes implicated in
diseases and pathways was assessed through cross-validation. A simple
assumption guided the procedure: the network had no direct knowledge of
pathways and diseases but learned genes' similarities and the interactions
among them. Moreover, to further investigate the space where the neural network
represents genes, the dimensionality of the embedding was reduced, and the
results were projected onto a human-comprehensible space. In conclusion, a set
of use cases illustrates the algorithm's potential applications in a real word
setting.

attention of researchers. Various studies on adversarial attacks and defenses
evolve in a spiral. However, the existing adversarial attack methods are all
designed in the time domain. They introduce more high-frequency components in

from the perspective of frequency domain, we propose a spectrum focused

transferability in the black-box attacks. Extensive experiments, qualitative

concentrate the adversarial energy on the spectrum where the signal is located,
significantly improve the adversarial attack performance while maintaining the
concealment in the frequency domain.

only two arbitrary channel samples are known. We also derive a lower-bound of

galaxies host large bulges or are entirely spheroidal. Here, we test this
scenario by presenting a full census of the kinematic morphologies of a
volume-limited sample of galaxies in the local Universe extracted from the
MaNGA galaxy survey. We measure the integrated stellar line-of-sight velocity
to velocity dispersion ratio ($V/\sigma$) for 4574 galaxies in the stellar mass
range $9.75 < \log M_{\star}[\rm{M}_{\odot}] < 11.75$. We show that at fixed
stellar mass, the distribution of $V/\sigma$ is not bimodal, and that a simple
separation between fast and slow rotators is over-simplistic. Fast rotators are
a mixture of at least two populations, referred to here as dynamically-cold
disks and intermediate systems, with disks dominating in both total stellar
mass and number. When considering star-forming and passive galaxies separately,
the star-forming population is almost entirely made up of disks, while the
passive population is mixed, implying an array of quenching mechanisms. Passive
disks represent $\sim$30% (both in number and mass) of passive galaxies, nearly
a factor of two higher than that of slow rotators, reiterating that these are
an important population for understanding galaxy quenching. These results paint
a picture of a local Universe dominated by disky galaxies, most of which become
somewhat less rotation-supported upon or after quenching. While spheroids are
present to a degree, they are certainly not the evolutionary end-point for the

dynamics of the membrane. We obtain an analytic expression for the deformation
and local membrane velocity, and thereby the evolution of clustering mediated
by a single integrin. The deformation, velocity and lipid clustering evolve
nonmonotonically and their dependences on the stochastic shuttling timescales

calculations relevant for the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. The relation
to the photoabsorption cross section allows to experimentally constrain photon
strength functions by investigating the photo-response of atomic nuclei.
[Purpose] We determine the photoresponse of $^{66}$Zn in the energy region of
5.6 MeV to 9.9 MeV and analyze the contribution of the ""elastic"" decay channel
back to the ground state. In addition, for the elastic channel electric and
magnetic dipole transitions were separated. [Methods] Nuclear resonance
fluorescence experiments were performed using a linearly-polarized
quasi-monoenergetic photon beam at the High Intensity $\gamma$-ray Source.
Photon beam energies from 5.6 to 9.9 MeV with an energy spread of about 3% were
selected in steps of 200-300 keV. Two High Purity Germanium detectors were used
for the subsequent $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy. [Results] Full photoabsorption
cross sections are extracted from the data making use of the monoenergetic
character of the photon beam. For the ground-state decay channel, the average
contribution of electric and magnetic dipole strengths is disentangled. The
average branching ratio back to the ground state is determined as well.
[Conclusions] The new results indicate lower cross sections when compared to
the values extracted from a former experiment using bremsstrahlung on
$^{66}$Zn. In the latter, the average branching ratio to the ground state is
estimated from statistical-model calculations in order to analyze the data.
Corresponding estimates from statistical-model calculations underestimate this
branching ratio compared to the values extracted from the present analysis,
which would partly explain the high cross sections determined from the
bremsstrahlung data.

holes. Surprisingly, in any black hole, the emergence of islands causes the
rise of the entanglement entropy of the radiation to decelerate after the Page

fine-grained entropy reaches a saturation value that is twice the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. For evaporating black holes, the fine-grained

failures. There are two dominant failure models, namely crash fault and
Byzantine fault. Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocols offer stronger
security guarantees, and thus are widely used in blockchain systems. However,
their security guarantees come at a dear cost to their performance and
scalability. Several works have improved BFT protocols, and Trusted Execution
Environment (TEE) has been shown to be an effective solution. However, existing
such works typically assume that each participating node is equipped with TEE.
For blockchain systems wherein participants typically have different hardware
configurations, i.e., some nodes feature TEE while others do not, existing
TEE-based BFT protocols are not applicable.
  This work studies the setting wherein not all participating nodes feature
TEE, under which we propose a new fault model called mixed fault. We explore a
new approach to designing efficient distributed fault-tolerant protocols under
the mixed fault model. In general, mixed fault tolerance (MFT) protocols assume
a network of $n$ nodes, among which up to $f = \frac{n-2}{3}$ can be subject to
mixed faults. We identify two key principles for designing efficient MFT
protocols, namely, (i) prioritizing non-equivocating nodes in leading the
protocol, and (ii) advocating the use of public-key cryptographic primitives
that allow authenticated messages to be aggregated. We showcase these design
principles by prescribing an MFT protocol, namely MRaft.
  We implemented a prototype of MRaft using Intel SGX, integrated it into the
CCF blockchain framework, conducted experiments, and showed that MFT protocols
can obtain the same security guarantees as their BFT counterparts while still
providing better performance (both transaction throughput and latency) and
scalability.

query, where query is registered by a single tight visual crop of the object in

  Our study is based on the three-stage baseline introduced in the Episodic
Memory benchmark. The baseline solves the problem by detection and tracking:
detect the similar objects in all the frames, then run a tracker from the most
confident detection result. In the VQ2D challenge, we identified two
limitations of the current baseline. (1) The training configuration has
redundant computation. Although the training set has millions of instances,
most of them are repetitive and the number of unique object is only around
14.6k. The repeated gradient computation of the same object lead to an
inefficient training; (2) The false positive rate is high on background frames.
This is due to the distribution gap between training and evaluation. During
training, the model is only able to see the clean, stable, and labeled frames,
but the egocentric videos also have noisy, blurry, or unlabeled background
frames. To this end, we developed a more efficient and effective solution.
Concretely, we bring the training loop from ~15 days to less than 24 hours, and
we achieve 0.17% spatial-temporal AP, which is 31% higher than the baseline.

quantum lack of causal structure. For example, the process known as the quantum
switch applies two operations ${\cal A}$ and ${\cal B}$ in a superposition of
the two possible orders, ${\cal A}$ before ${\cal B}$ and ${\cal B}$ before
${\cal A}$. Experimental implementations of the quantum switch have been
challenged by some on the grounds that the operations ${\cal A}$ and ${\cal B}$
were implemented more than once, thereby simulating indefinite causal order
rather than actually implementing it. Motivated by this debate, we consider a
situation in which the quantum operations are physically described by a
light-matter interaction model. While for our model the two processes are
indistinguishable in the infinite energy regime, restricting the energy
available for the implementation of the operations introduces imperfections,
which allow one to distinguish processes using different number of operations.
We consider such an energetically-constrained scenario and compare the quantum
switch to one of its natural simulations, where each operation is implemented
twice. Considering a commuting-vs-anticommuting unitary discrimination task, we
find that within our model the quantum switch performs better, for some fixed
amount of energy, than its simulation. In addition to the known computational
or communication advantages of causal superpositions, our work raises new
questions about their potential energetic advantages.

provide better human-robot interactions. The existing works are limited to
trimmed video-level emotion classification, failing to locate the temporal
window corresponding to the emotion. In this paper, we introduce a new task,
named Temporal Emotion Localization in videos~(TEL), which aims to detect human
emotions and localize their corresponding temporal boundaries in untrimmed
videos with aligned subtitles. TEL presents three unique challenges compared to
temporal action localization: 1) The emotions have extremely varied temporal
dynamics; 2) The emotion cues are embedded in both appearances and complex
plots; 3) The fine-grained temporal annotations are complicated and
labor-intensive. To address the first two challenges, we propose a novel
dilated context integrated network with a coarse-fine two-stream architecture.
The coarse stream captures varied temporal dynamics by modeling
multi-granularity temporal contexts. The fine stream achieves complex plots
understanding by reasoning the dependency between the multi-granularity
temporal contexts from the coarse stream and adaptively integrates them into
fine-grained video segment features. To address the third challenge, we
introduce a cross-modal consensus learning paradigm, which leverages the
inherent semantic consensus between the aligned video and subtitle to achieve
weakly-supervised learning. We contribute a new testing set with 3,000
manually-annotated temporal boundaries so that future research on the TEL
problem can be quantitatively evaluated. Extensive experiments show the
effectiveness of our approach on temporal emotion localization. The repository

the accuracy for ImageNet and similar datasets increased over time, the
performance on tasks beyond the classification of natural images is yet to be
explored. Most Semi-Supervised Learning methods rely on a carefully manually
designed data augmentation pipeline that is not transferable for learning on
images of other domains. In this work, we propose a Semi-Supervised Learning
method that automatically selects the most effective data augmentation policy
for a particular dataset. We build upon the Fixmatch method and extend it with
meta-learning of augmentations. The augmentation is learned in additional
training before the classification training and makes use of bi-level
optimization, to optimize the augmentation policy and maximize accuracy. We
evaluate our approach on two domain-specific datasets, containing satellite
images and hand-drawn sketches, and obtain state-of-the-art results. We further
investigate in an ablation the different parameters relevant for learning
augmentation policies and show how policy learning can be used to adapt
augmentations to datasets beyond ImageNet.

where spatial and temporal pairwise relations among objects are encoded via
localized polar coordinates on graph edges. This representation makes our
geometric relations invariant to global transformations and smooth trajectory
changes, especially under non-holonomic motion. This allows our graph neural
network to learn to effectively encode temporal and spatial interactions and
fully leverage contextual and motion cues to obtain final scene interpretation
by posing data association as edge classification. We establish a new

statistics and machine learning. The optimal ""transport of probability
measures"" is also a recurring theme in stochastic control and distributed
control, where in the latter application the probability measure corresponds to
an empirical distribution associated with a large collection of distributed
agents, subject to local and global control. The goal of this paper is to make
precise these connections, which inspires new relaxations of optimal transport
for application in new and traditional domains. The proposed relaxation
replaces a target measure with a ""moment class"": a set of probability measures
defined by generalized moment constraints. This is motivated by applications to
control, outlier detection, and to address computational complexity. The main
conclusions are (i) A characterization of the solution is obtained, similar to
Kantorovich duality, in which one of the dual functions in the classical theory
is replaced by a linear combination of the features defining the generalized
moments. Hence the dimension of the optimization problem coincides with the
number of constraints, even with an uncountable state space; (ii) By
introducing regularization in the form of relative entropy, the solution can be
interpreted as replacing a maximum with a softmax in the dual; (iii) In
applications such as control for which it is not known a-priori if the moment
class is non-empty, a relaxation is proposed whose solution admits a similar
characterization; (iv) The gradient of the dual function can be expressed in
terms of the expectation of the features under a tilted probability measure,
which motivates Monte-Carlo techniques for computation.

2 \pi$) two-dimensional periodic domain leads to the emergence of a
system-sized coherent vortex dipole. We report a numerical hyperviscous study
of the spatial vorticity profile inside one of the vortices. The exciting force
was shortly correlated in time, random in space, and had a correlation length
$l_f = 2\pi/k_f$ with $k_f$ ranging from $100$ to $12.5$. Previously, it was
found that in the asymptotic limit of small-scale forcing, the vorticity
exhibits the power-law behavior $\Omega(r) = (3 \epsilon/\alpha)^{1/2} r^{-1}$,
where $r$ is the distance to the vortex center, $\alpha$ is the bottom friction
coefficient, and $\epsilon$ is the inverse energy flux. Now we show that for a
spatially homogeneous forcing with finite $k_f$ the vorticity profile becomes
steeper, with the difference increasing with the pumping scale but decreasing
with the Reynolds number at the forcing scale. Qualitatively, this behaviour is
related to a decrease in the effective pumping of the coherent vortex with
distance from its center. To support this statement, we perform an additional
simulation with spatially localized forcing, in which the effective pumping of
the coherent vortex, on the contrary, increases with $r$ and show for the first
time that in this case the vorticity profile can be flatter than the asymptotic

F-statistic in the Monte Carlo analysis of Andrews (2018), who found in a
heteroskedastic grouped-data design that even for very large values of the
robust F-statistic, the standard 2SLS confidence intervals had large coverage
distortions. This finding appears to discredit the robust F-statistic as a test
for underidentification. However, it is shown here that large values of the
robust F-statistic do imply that there is first-stage information, but this may
not be utilized well by the 2SLS estimator, or the standard GMM estimator. An
estimator that corrects for this is a robust GMM estimator, denoted GMMf, with
the robust weight matrix not based on the structural residuals, but on the
first-stage residuals. For the grouped-data setting of Andrews (2018), this
GMMf estimator gives the weights to the group specific estimators according to
the group specific concentration parameters in the same way as 2SLS does under
homoskedasticity, which is formally shown using weak instrument asymptotics.
The GMMf estimator is much better behaved than the 2SLS estimator in the
Andrews (2018) design, behaving well in terms of relative bias and Wald-test
size distortion at more standard values of the robust F-statistic. We show that
the same patterns can occur in a dynamic panel data model when the error
variance is heteroskedastic over time. We further derive the conditions under
which the Stock and Yogo (2005) weak instruments critical values apply to the
robust F-statistic in relation to the behaviour of the GMMf estimator.

a comprehensive method of entanglement detection when only a very limited

For quantum background states that are peaked on trajectories of the effective
description of Loop Quantum Cosmology, the main difference between the two
considered formalisms is found in the expression of this mass. The value of the
mass at the bounce is especially important, since it is only in a short
interval around this event that the quantum geometry effects on the
perturbations are relevant. In a previous article, the properties of this mass
were discussed for an inflaton potential of quadratic form, or with similar
characteristics. In the present work, we extend this study to other interesting
potentials in cosmology, namely the Starobinsky and the exponential potentials.
We prove that there exists a finite interval of values of the potential (which
includes the zero but typically goes beyond the sector of kinetically dominated
inflaton energy density) for which the hybrid mass is positive at the bounce

the field of natural language processing (NLP), and two deep learning (DL)
models long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN).
For datasets we used four datasets Profilence, BlueGene/L (BGL), Hadoop
Distributed File System (HDFS) and Hadoop. Other settings are the size of the
sliding window which determines how many surrounding events we are using to
predict a given event, mask position (the position within the window we are
predicting), the usage of only unique sequences, and the portion of data that
is used for training. The results show clear indications of settings that can
be generalized across datasets. The performance of the DL models does not
deteriorate as the window size increases while the N-Gram model shows worse
performance with large window sizes on the BGL and Profilence datasets. Despite
the popularity of Next Event Prediction, the results show that in this context
it is better not to predict events at the edges of the subsequence, i.e., first
or last event, with the best result coming from predicting the fourth event
when the window size is five. Regarding the amount of data used for training,
the results show differences across datasets and models. For example, the
N-Gram model appears to be more sensitive toward the lack of data than the DL
models. Overall, for similar experimental setups we suggest the following
general baseline: Window size 10, mask position second to last, do not filter
out non-unique sequences, and use a half of the total data for training.

there exists distribution shift between deployment and training. Domain
Generalization (DG) aims to safely transfer a model to unseen target domains by
only relying on a set of source domains. Although various DG approaches have
been proposed, a recent study named DomainBed, reveals that most of them do not
beat the simple Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). To this end, we propose a
general framework that is orthogonal to existing DG algorithms and could
improve their performance consistently. Unlike previous DG works that stake on
a static source model to be hopefully a universal one, our proposed AdaODM
adaptively modifies the source model at test time for different target domains.
Specifically, we create multiple domain-specific classifiers upon a shared
domain-generic feature extractor. The feature extractor and classifiers are
trained in an adversarial way, where the feature extractor embeds the input
samples into a domain-invariant space, and the multiple classifiers capture the
distinct decision boundaries that each of them relates to a specific source
domain. During testing, distribution differences between target and source
domains could be effectively measured by leveraging prediction disagreement
among source classifiers. By fine-tuning source models to minimize the
disagreement at test time, target domain features are well aligned to the
invariant feature space. We verify AdaODM on two popular DG methods, namely ERM
and CORAL, and four DG benchmarks, namely VLCS, PACS, OfficeHome, and
TerraIncognita. The results show AdaODM stably improves the generalization
capacity on unseen domains and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

learning under supervision of manually pre-defined targets (e.g., one-hot or
the Hadamard codes). Such target coding schemes are less flexible to model
inter-class correlation and are sensitive to sparse and imbalanced data
distribution as well. In light of this, this paper introduces a novel target
coding scheme -- dynamic target relation graphs (DTRG), which, as an auxiliary
feature regularization, is a self-generated structural output to be mapped from
input images. Specifically, online computation of class-level feature centers
is designed to generate cross-category distance in the representation space,
which can thus be depicted by a dynamic graph in a non-parametric manner.
Explicitly minimizing intra-class feature variations anchored on those
class-level centers can encourage learning of discriminative features.
Moreover, owing to exploiting inter-class dependency, the proposed target
graphs can alleviate data sparsity and imbalanceness in representation
learning. Inspired by recent success of the mixup style data augmentation, this
paper introduces randomness into soft construction of dynamic target relation
graphs to further explore relation diversity of target classes. Experimental
results can demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a number of diverse
benchmarks of multiple visual classification tasks, especially achieving the
state-of-the-art performance on popular fine-grained object benchmarks and
superior robustness against sparse and imbalanced data. Source codes are made

potential (IP), double ionization potential (DIP), and lifetime (or decay
width) of the temporary bound state in these non-radiative decay processes. We
have chosen LiH-NH$_3$ and LiH-H$_2$O as test systems. The equation of motion

increases these quantities compared to neutral systems. The protonation closes
the inner valence state relaxation channels for ICD/ETMD. For example, the
decay of the O-2s/N-2s state stops in protonated systems (LiH$_2^+$-H$_2$O,
LiH$_2^+$-NH$_3$, and LiH-NH$_4^+$). Our study also shows that the efficiency,

Approaches, Autonomous UAS, aircraft self-separation and others. In order to
leverage the introduction of such concepts, it is necessary to develop solid
knowledge on the foundations of safety in complex systems and use this
knowledge to elaborate sound demonstrations of either safety or unsafety of new
system designs. These demonstrations at early design stages will help reducing
costs both on development of new technology as well as reducing the risk of
such technology causing accidents when in use.

enhance receptive field of small face, and use NWD Loss to make up for the
sensitivity of IoU to the location deviation of tiny objects. For face
occlusion, we present an attention module named SEAM and introduce Repulsion
Loss to solve it. Moreover, we use a weight function Slide to solve the

signal shaping. These components have to be examined regarding the effect of
ionizing radiation. A Total Ionizing Dose (TID) test was done with prototype
detector modules with 64x64 DEPFETs and one SWITCHER and VERITAS ASIC each. The
current design of the WFI detector head features a proton shield equivalent to
4 cm of aluminum in order to prevent a strong increase of leakage current in
the fully depleted 450 $\mu$m thick bulk of the sensor. This keeps the expected
doses and dose rates during the nominal mission relatively low ($\sim$5 Gy). It
is nevertheless important to study the current system in a dedicated TID test
in order to exclude unforeseen effects and to study any radiation related
changes that can have an effect on the very sensitive readout chain and the
detector performance. The combination of low doses, low dose rates, low
operating temperature (<-60{\deg}C) but high sensitivity on small changes of
the threshold voltages represent somehow unusual boundary conditions in
comparison to TID tests for standard radiation hard electronic components.
Under these circumstances it was found beneficial to do the test in our own
laboratory with an X-ray source in order to realize irradiation during nominal
operation conditions. Furthermore, it facilitated to take annealing effects
into account. Reasonably accurate dosimetry is achieved by measuring the X-ray
spectrum and intensity with the device under test. After irradiation to a total
dose of 14 Gy and subsequent annealing the threshold voltage of the DEPFETs
were shifted by a mean value of 80 mV, the performance remained unchanged apart
from a slight increase in readout noise by 10%.

The study of the oldest and most metal-poor stars in our Galaxy
promotes our understanding of the Galactic chemical evolution and the beginning
of Galaxy and star formation. However, they are notoriously difficult to find,
with only five stars at $\mathrm{[Fe/H]<-5.0}$ having been detected to date.
Thus, the spectrophotometric data of 219 million sources which became available
in the third Gaia Data Release comprise a very promising dataset for the
identification of metal-poor stars. Aims. We want to use the low-resolution
Gaia Blue Photometer / Red Photometer (BP/RP) spectra to identify metal-poor
stars. Our primary aspiration is to help populate the poorly constrained tail
of the metallicity distribution function of the stellar halo of the Galaxy.
Methods. We developed a metal-poor candidate selection method based on flux
ratios from the BP/RP Gaia spectra, using simulated synthetic spectra. Results.
We found a relation between the relative iron abundance and the flux ratio of
the Ca H \& K region to that of the $\mathrm{H\beta}$ line. This relation is
temperature and surface gravity dependent, and it holds for stars with
$\mathrm{4800\,K \leq T_{eff}\leq6300\,K}$. We applied it to noisy simulated
synthetic spectra and inferred $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$ with an uncertainty of
$\sigma_{\mathrm{[Fe/H]}}\lessapprox0.65$ dex for $\mathrm{-3\leq[Fe/H]}\leq
0.5$ and G=15-17mag, which is sufficient to identify stars at
$\mathrm{[Fe/H]<-2.0 }$ reliably. We predict that by selecting stars with
inferred $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\leq-2.5$ dex, we can retrieve 80% of the stars with
$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\leq-3$ and have a success rate of about 50%, that is one in
two stars we select would have $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\leq-3$. We do not take into
account the effect of reddening, so our method should only be applied to stars
which are located in regions of low extinction.

spaces. Determining equilibria in auction games is computationally hard in
general and no exact solution theory is known. We introduce an algorithmic
framework in which we discretize type and action space and then learn
distributional strategies via online optimization algorithms. One advantage of
distributional strategies is that we do not have to make any assumptions on the
shape of the bid function. Besides, the expected utility of agents is linear in
the strategies. It follows that if our optimization algorithms converge to a
pure strategy, then they converge to an approximate equilibrium of the
discretized game with high precision. Importantly, we show that the equilibrium
of the discretized game approximates an equilibrium in the continuous game. In
a wide variety of auction games, we provide empirical evidence that the
approach approximates the analytical (pure) Bayes Nash equilibrium closely.
This speed and precision is remarkable, because in many finite games learning
dynamics do not converge or are even chaotic. In standard models where agents
are symmetric, we find equilibrium in seconds. While we focus on dual
averaging, we show that the overall approach converges independent of the
regularizer and alternative online convex optimization methods achieve similar
results, even though the discretized game neither satisfies monotonicity nor
variational stability globally. The method allows for interdependent valuations
and different types of utility functions and provides a foundation for broadly
applicable equilibrium solvers that can push the boundaries of equilibrium
analysis in auction markets and beyond.

problem-specific heuristics for making locally optimal choices at each stage,
we use QAs that sample from the ground state of problem-dependent Hamiltonians
at cryogenic temperatures and use retrieved samples to estimate the probability
distribution of problem variables. More specifically, we look at each spin of
the Ising model as a random variable and contract all problem variables whose
corresponding uncertainties are negligible. Our empirical results on a D-Wave
2000Q quantum processor demonstrate that the proposed quantum-assisted greedy
algorithm (QAGA) scheme can find notably better solutions compared to the
state-of-the-art techniques in the realm of quantum annealing

cost-effective designing of web applications controlled via everyday
smartphones. At its core, SmartControllerJS establishes a connection between
two webpages, one page running on a desktop browser and the other on the user's
smartphone. The smartphone webpage loads a controller interface allowing users
to control a web application running on their computer's browser. The
SmartControllerJS framework enables fast iteration loops when designing
interactive user experiments because it has minimal friction and allows for
scaling, while having no running costs. We first describe how this library is
built, how it can be used, and provide interactive examples. We then present
two games designed for public screens along with results from user studies
evaluating acceptability and ease of use. Finally, we implement a custom
controller based on user feedback and introduce connection monitoring tools. We
believe SmartControllerJS can accelerate the design of interactive experiments
for researchers in Human-Computer Interaction, and be a useful tool for
educational projects. All our code is available at
https://github.com/SmartControllerJS and links to all demos can be found in

investigate changes in birefringence in a simple transmission geometry. In
spite of the polycrystalline nature of the film and its moderate thickness, the
field-induced transition produces a sizeable effect observable under a

homogeneous birefringent medium. The time evolution of this field-induced
birefringence provides information about irreversibilities in the
antiferroelectric switching process and its slow dynamics. The change in
birefringence has two main contributions, one that responds briskly (~ 0.5 s),
and a slower one that rises and saturates over a period of as long as 30
minutes. Possible origins for this long saturation and relaxation times are

transmitted surface waves are amplified. Second, we show that when a capacitive
boundary is switched to an inductive one, the surface wave stops completely,
with a ""frozen"" static magnetic field distribution. The static magnetic fields
are ""melt"" and restore propagating surface waves when the boundary is switched
back to a capacitive one. Third, we show that temporal jumps of the boundary
impedance couple free-space propagating waves to the surface wave, which is an
analog to a spatial prism. These interesting effects enabled by temporal jumps

  in the embedding space","Submitted to Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Catastrophic forgetting (CF) occurs when a neural network loses the
information previously learned while training on a set of samples from a
different distribution, i.e., a new task. Existing approaches have achieved
remarkable results in mitigating CF, especially in a scenario called task
incremental learning. However, this scenario is not realistic, and limited work
has been done to achieve good results on more realistic scenarios. In this
paper, we propose a novel regularization method called Centroids Matching,
that, inspired by meta-learning approaches, fights CF by operating in the
feature space produced by the neural network, achieving good results while
requiring a small memory footprint. Specifically, the approach classifies the
samples directly using the feature vectors produced by the neural network, by
matching those vectors with the centroids representing the classes from the
current task, or all the tasks up to that point. Centroids Matching is faster
than competing baselines, and it can be exploited to efficiently mitigate CF,
by preserving the distances between the embedding space produced by the model
when past tasks were over, and the one currently produced, leading to a method
that achieves high accuracy on all the tasks, without using an external memory
when operating on easy scenarios, or using a small one for more realistic ones.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Centroids Matching achieves accuracy
gains on multiple datasets and scenarios.

This paper proposes a new shape control task for Deformable Linear Objects

emerging from diverse types of nodes and edges, there is a bursting research
interest in learning expressive node representations in multiplex heterogeneous
networks. One of the most important tasks in recommender systems is to predict
the potential connection between two nodes under a specific edge type (i.e.,
relationship). Although existing studies utilize explicit metapaths to
aggregate neighbors, practically they only consider intra-relationship
metapaths and thus fail to leverage the potential uplift by inter-relationship
information. Moreover, it is not always straightforward to exploit
inter-relationship metapaths comprehensively under diverse relationships,
especially with the increasing number of node and edge types. In addition,
contributions of different relationships between two nodes are difficult to
measure. To address the challenges, we propose HybridGNN, an end-to-end GNN
model with hybrid aggregation flows and hierarchical attentions to fully
utilize the heterogeneity in the multiplex scenarios. Specifically, HybridGNN
applies a randomized inter-relationship exploration module to exploit the
multiplexity property among different relationships. Then, our model leverages
hybrid aggregation flows under intra-relationship metapaths and randomized
exploration to learn the rich semantics. To explore the importance of different
aggregation flow and take advantage of the multiplexity property, we bring
forward a novel hierarchical attention module which leverages both
metapath-level attention and relationship-level attention. Extensive
experimental results suggest that HybridGNN achieves the best performance
compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.

nuclear physics input and the astrophysical site. The former strongly affects
the ratios of isotopes of close mass (129I/127I, 244Pu/238U, and 247Pu/235U).
The 129I/247Cm ratio, instead, which involves isotopes of a very different
mass, is much more variable than those listed above and is more affected by the
physics of the astrophysical site. We consider possible scenarios for the
evolution of the abundances of these radioactive nuclei in the galactic
interstellar medium and verify under which scenarios and conditions solutions
can be found for the origin of 244Pu that are consistent with the origin of the
other isotopes. Solutions are generally found for all the possible different
regimes controlled by the interval ($\delta$) between additions from the source
to the parcel of interstellar medium gas that ended up in the Solar System,
relative to decay timescales. If r-process ejecta in interstellar medium are
mixed within a relatively small area (leading to a long $\delta$), we derive
that the last event that explains the 129I and 247Cm abundances in the early
Solar System can also account for the abundance of 244Pu. Due to its longer
half life, however, 244Pu may have originated from a few events instead of one
only. If r-process ejecta in interstellar medium are mixed within a relatively
large area (leading to a short $\delta$), we derive that the time elapsed from

(EsGB) theories evade no-hair theorems and allow for scalarized compact objects

the main character in the process and nature of scalarization. With the right
choice, the theory becomes an extension of general relativity (GR) in the sense
any solution to the GR field equations remains a solution in the EsGB theory,
but it can destabilize if a certain threshold value of the spacetime curvature
is exceeded. Thus BHs can spontaneously scalarized. The most studied driving
mechanism to this phenomenon is a tachyonic instability due to an effective
negative squared mass for the scalar field. However, even when the coupling is
chosen such that this mass is zero, higher order terms with respect to the
scalar field can lead to what is coined nonlinear scalarization. In this paper
we investigate how Kerr BHs spontaneously scalarize by evolving the scalar
field on a fixed background via solving the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation. We
consider two different coupling functions with higher order terms, one that
yields a non-zero effective mass and another that does not. We sweep through
the Kerr parameter space in its mass and spin and obtain the scalar charge by
the end of the evolution when the field settles in an equilibrium stationary
state. When there is no tachyonic instability present, there is no probe limit
in which the BH scalarizes with zero charge, i.e. there is a gap between bald
and hairy BHs and they only connect when the mass goes to zero together with
the charge.

goal of nuclear structure physics. A flexible framework which easily includes
excited states and many-body correlations is the configuration-interaction
shell model (SM), but the exponential growth of the basis means one needs an
efficient truncation scheme, ideally one that includes both deformation and
pairing correlations.
  Purpose: We propose an efficient truncation scheme of the SM: starting from a
pair condensate variationally defined by Hartree-Fock single-particle states
and the particle-number conserved Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (NBCS)
approximation, we carry out projection of states with good angular momentum.
  Methods: After generating Hartree-Fock single-particle states with Kramers
degeneracy in a SM space, we optimize the pair amplitudes in the NBCS by
minimizing the energy, and then use linear algebra projection (LAP) of states
with good angular momentum. Both NBCS and LAP are computationally fast.
  Results: Our calculations yield good agreement with full
configuration-interaction SM calculations for low-lying states of transitional
and rotational nuclei with axially symmetric and triaxial deformation in
medium- and heavy-mass regions: $^{44,46,48}$Ti, $^{48,50}$Cr, $^{52}$Fe,
$^{60,62,64}$Zn, $^{66,68}$Ge, $^{68}$Se, and $^{108,110}$Xe. We predict
low-lying states of $^{112-114}\textrm{Ba}$ and $^{116-120}\textrm{Ce}$, nuclei
difficult to reach by large-scale SM calculations.
  Conclusions: Both pair correlation and the configuration mixing between
different intrinsic states play a key role in reproducing collectivity and
shape coexistence, demonstrating the utility of this truncation scheme of the
SM to study transitional and deformed nuclei.

required regularity conditions are not satisfied. In particular, this is the
case for rectified linear unit (ReLU) networks. In this paper, we prove a
variant of the relevant dynamical systems result, a center-stable manifold
theorem, in which we relax some of the regularity requirements. Then, we verify
that shallow ReLU networks fit into the new framework. Building on a
classification of critical points of the square integral loss of shallow ReLU
networks measured against an affine target function, we deduce that gradient
descent avoids most saddle points. We proceed to prove convergence to global
minima if the initialization is sufficiently good, which is expressed by an
explicit threshold on the limiting loss.

fine-tune the largescale audio and image pre-trained models on the target
dataset, then either fuse the intermediate representations of the audio model
and the visual model, or fuse the coarse-grained decision of both models at the
clip level. Such methods ignore the detailed audio events and visual objects in
audio-visual scenes (AVS), while humans often identify different scenes through
audio events and visual objects within and the congruence between them. To
exploit the fine-grained information of audio events and visual objects in AVS,
and coordinate the implicit relationship between audio events and visual
objects, this paper proposes a multibranch model equipped with contrastive
event-object alignment (CEOA) and semantic-based fusion (SF) for AVSC. CEOA
aims to align the learned embeddings of audio events and visual objects by
comparing the difference between audio-visual event-object pairs. Then, visual
objects associated with certain audio events and vice versa are accentuated by
cross-attention and undergo SF for semantic-level fusion. Experiments show
that: 1) the proposed AVSC model equipped with CEOA and SF outperforms the
results of audio-only and visual-only models, i.e., the audio-visual results
are better than the results from a single modality. 2) CEOA aligns the
embeddings of audio events and related visual objects on a fine-grained level,
and the SF effectively integrates both; 3) Compared with other large-scale
integrated systems, the proposed model shows competitive performance, even
without using additional datasets and data augmentation tricks.

considered. Buoys on both sides are used for decomposing bi-directional waves

the middle buoy is predicted by these decomposed waves. The deterministic wave
prediction is based on the impulse response function, and a cosine-filtered
impulse response function is proposed to reduce an error due to the truncation

libraries. However, for large binaries, the runtime is prohibitively high.
Other automated approaches focused on cryptographic implementations and media
software but are not directly applicable to user input. Hence, discovering and
eliminating all user input side-channel leakage on a cache-line granularity
within huge code bases are impractical.
  In this paper, we present a new generic cache template attack technique,
LBTA, layered binary templating attacks. LBTA uses multiple coarser-grained
side channel layers as an extension to cache-line granularity templating to
speed up the runtime of cache templating attacks. We describe LBTA with a
variable number of layers with concrete side channels of different granularity,
ranging from 64 B to 2MB in practice and in theory beyond. In particular the
software-level page cache side channel in combination with the hardware-level
L3 cache side channel, already reduces the templating runtime by three orders
of magnitude. We apply LBTAs to different software projects and thereby
discover data deduplication and dead-stripping during compilation and linking
as novel security issues. We show that these mechanisms introduce large spatial
distances in binaries for data accessed during a keystroke, enabling reliable
leakage of keystrokes. Using LBTA on Chromium-based applications, we can build
a full unprivileged cache-based keylogger. Our findings show that all user
input to Chromium-based apps is affected and we demonstrate this on a selection
of popular apps including Signal, Threema, Discord, and password manager apps

conclude that all apps that use the framework will also be affected, i.e.,

the interference of optical lattices whose spatial periods differ by a factor
of two, OSL gives rise to a periodic potential that acts on atomic translation
via the AC Stark effect. The latter system, also known as the generalized
planar pendulum (GPP), is realized by subjecting a planar rigid rotor to
combined orienting and aligning interactions due to the coupling of the rotor's
permanent and induced electric dipole moments with the combined fields. The
mapping makes it possible to establish correspondence between concepts
developed for the two eigenproblems individually, such as localization on the
one hand and orientation/alignment on the other. Moreover, since the GPP
problem is conditionally quasi-exactly solvable (C-QES), so is atomic trapping
in an OSL. We make use of both the correspondence and the quasi-exact
solvability to treat ultracold atoms in an optical superlattice as a
semifinite-gap system. The band structure of this system follows from the
eigenenergies and their genuine and avoided crossings obtained previously for
the GPP as analytic solutions of the Whittaker-Hill equation. These solutions
characterize both the squeezing and the tunneling of atoms trapped in an

form.

dataset, which incurs high labeling and computational costs. To reduce such
costs, a selective training strategy, called active learning (AL), chooses only
a subset of the original dataset to learn while maintaining the trained model's
performance. Here, we design and implement two AL-enpowered variational quantum
classifiers, to investigate the potential applications and effectiveness of AL
in quantum machine learning. Firstly, we build a programmable free-space
photonic quantum processor, which enables the programmed implementation of
various hybrid quantum-classical computing algorithms. Then, we code the
designed variational quantum classifier with AL into the quantum processor, and
execute comparative tests for the classifiers with and without the AL strategy.
The results validate the great advantage of AL in quantum machine learning, as
it saves at most $85\%$ labeling efforts and $91.6\%$ percent computational
efforts compared to the training without AL on a data classification task. Our
results inspire AL's further applications in large-scale quantum machine
learning to drastically reduce training data and speed up training,
underpinning the exploration of practical quantum advantages in quantum physics

the semi-supervised setting, where a training dataset with all normal instances
is required. However, preparing such a dataset is very laborious since each
single data instance should be fully guaranteed to be normal. It is, therefore,
desired to explore multivariate time series anomaly detection methods based on
the dataset without any label knowledge. In this paper, we propose MTGFlow, an
unsupervised anomaly detection approach for multivariate time series anomaly
detection via dynamic graph and entity-aware normalizing flow, leaning only on
a widely accepted hypothesis that abnormal instances exhibit sparse densities
than the normal. However, the complex interdependencies among entities and the
diverse inherent characteristics of each entity pose significant challenges on
the density estimation, let alone to detect anomalies based on the estimated
possibility distribution. To tackle these problems, we propose to learn the
mutual and dynamic relations among entities via a graph structure learning
model, which helps to model accurate distribution of multivariate time series.
Moreover, taking account of distinct characteristics of the individual
entities, an entity-aware normalizing flow is developed to describe each entity
into a parameterized normal distribution, thereby producing fine-grained
density estimation. Incorporating these two strategies, MTGFlow achieves
superior anomaly detection performance. Experiments on five public datasets

another noncoplanar vortex crystal phase without a net scalar chirality in the

Automated convoy of heavy-duty trucks in the form of platooning is one such
application designed to maintain close gaps between trucks to exploit drafting
benefits and improve fuel economy, and has traditionally been handled with
classically-designed connected and adaptive cruise control (CACC). This paper
is motivated by demonstrated limitations of such a control strategy, in which a
classical CACC was unable to efficiently handle real-world road grade and
velocity transient disturbances without the assistance of fleet operator
intervention, and is non-adaptive to varied hardware and loading conditions of
the operating truck. This automation strategy is addressed by forming a
cooperative model predictive control (MPC) for eco-platooning that considers
interactions with trailing trucks to incentivize platoon harmonization under
road disturbances, velocity transients, and engine limitations, and further
improves energy economy by reducing unnecessary engine effort. This is
accomplished for each truck by sharing load, maximum engine power, transmission
ratios, control states, and intended trajectories with its nearest neighbors.
The performance of the considerate and cooperative strategy was demonstrated on
a real-world driving scenario against a similar non-considerate control
strategy, and overall it was found that the considerate strategy significantly
improved harmonization between the platooned trucks in a real-time
implementable manner.

arises from the new degrees of freedom and length scales which are not present

article we compute the energy carried by gravitational waves in bigravity
starting from the action, using the canonical current formalism. The canonical

  Communication over Quantum Channels",,,,,"quant-ph cs.IT math-ph math.IT math.MP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Achievability in information theory refers to demonstrating a coding strategy
that accomplishes a prescribed performance benchmark for the underlying task.
In quantum information theory, the crafted Hayashi-Nagaoka operator inequality
is an essential technique in proving a wealth of one-shot achievability bounds
since it effectively resembles a union bound in various problems. In this work,
we show that the pretty-good measurement naturally plays a role as the union
bound as well. A judicious application of it considerably simplifies the
derivation of one-shot achievability for classical-quantum (c-q) channel coding
via an elegant three-line proof.
  The proposed analysis enjoys the following favorable features: (i) The
established one-shot bound admits a closed-form expression as in the celebrated
Holevo-Helstrom Theorem. Namely, the average error probability of sending $M$
messages through a c-q channel is upper bounded by the error of distinguishing
the joint state between channel input and output against $(M-1)$-many products
of its marginals. (ii) Our bound directly yields asymptotic results in the
large deviation, small deviation, and moderate deviation regimes in a unified
manner. (iii) The coefficients incurred in applying the Hayashi-Nagaoka
operator inequality are no longer needed. Hence, the derived one-shot bound
sharpens existing results that rely on the Hayashi-Nagaoka operator inequality.
In particular, we obtain the tightest achievable $\epsilon$-one-shot capacity
for c-q channel heretofore, and it improves the third-order coding rate in the
asymptotic scenario. (iv) Our result holds for infinite-dimensional Hilbert
space. (v) The proposed method applies to deriving one-shot bounds for data
compression with quantum side information, entanglement-assisted classical
communication over quantum channels, and various quantum network
information-processing protocols.

  on infectious disease dynamics",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Vaccination is essential for the management of infectious diseases, many of
which continue to pose devastating public health and economic challenges across
the world. However, many vaccines are imperfect having only a partial
protective effect in decreasing disease transmission and/or favouring recovery
of infected individuals, and possibly exhibiting trade-off between these two
properties. Furthermore, population turnover, that is the rate at which
individuals enter and exit the population, is another key factor determining
the epidemiological dynamics. While these factors have yet been studied
separately, we investigate the interplay between the efficiency and property of
an imperfect vaccine and population turnover. We build a mathematical model
with frequency incidence rate, a recovered compartment, and an heterogeneous
host population with respect to vaccination. We first compute the basic
reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ and study the global stability of the
equilibrium points. Using a sensitivity analysis, we then assess the most
influential parameters determining the total number of infected and
$\mathcal{R}_0$ over time. We derive analytically and numerically conditions
for the vaccination coverage and efficiency to achieve disease eradication
($\mathcal{R}_0 < 1$) assuming different intensity of the population turnover
(weak and strong), vaccine properties (transmission and/or recovery) and
trade-off between the latter. We show that the minimum vaccination coverage
increases with lower population turnover, decreases with higher vaccine
efficiency (transmission or recovery), and is increased/decreased by up to 15\%
depending on the trade-off between the vaccine properties. We conclude that the
coverage target for vaccination campaigns should be evaluated based on the
interplay between these factors.

wide range of applications in data mining, machine learning, and multivariate
statistical analysis. When the data set is large, this process will be
time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an efficient quantum MC algorithm
based on the block-encoding technique, which enables the existing quantum
algorithms can get rid of the assumption that the original data set has been
classically mean-centered. Specifically, we first adopt the strategy that MC
can be achieved by multiplying by the centering matrix $C$, i.e., removing the
row means, column means and row-column means of the original data matrix $X$
can be expressed as $XC$, $CX$ and $CXC$, respectively. This allows many
classical problems involving MC, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to
directly solve the matrix algebra problems related to $XC$, $CX$ or $CXC$.
Next, we can employ the block-encoding technique to realize MC. To achieve it,
we first show how to construct the block-encoding of the centering matrix $C$,
and then further obtain the block-encodings of $XC$, $CX$ and $CXC$. Finally,
we describe one by one how to apply our MC algorithm to PCA and other
algorithms.

remains an open challenge in vision perception pre-training. In this paper, we
propose GPPF, a General Perception Pre-training Framework, that pre-trains a
task-level dynamic network, which is composed by knowledge ""legos"" in each
layers, on labeled multi-task and multi-domain datasets. By inspecting humans'
innate ability to learn in complex environment, we recognize and transfer three
critical elements to deep networks: (1) simultaneous exposure to diverse
cross-task and cross-domain information in each batch. (2) partitioned
knowledge storage in separate lego units driven by knowledge sharing. (3)
sparse activation of a subset of lego units for both pre-training and
downstream tasks. Noteworthy, the joint training of disparate vision tasks is
non-trivial due to their differences in input shapes, loss functions, output
formats, data distributions, etc. Therefore, we innovatively develop a
plug-and-play multi-task training algorithm, which supports Single Iteration
Multiple Tasks (SIMT) concurrently training. SIMT lays the foundation of
pre-training with large-scale multi-task multi-domain datasets and is proved
essential for stable training in our GPPF experiments. Excitingly, the
exhaustive experiments show that, our GPPF-R50 model achieves significant
improvements of 2.5-5.8 over a strong baseline of the 8 pre-training tasks in
GPPF-15M and harvests a range of SOTAs over the 22 downstream tasks with
similar computation budgets. We also validate the generalization ability of
GPPF to SOTA vision transformers with consistent improvements. These solid
experimental results fully prove the effective knowledge learning, storing,
sharing, and transfer provided by our novel GPPF framework.

(SIC) and frequency downconversion method is proposed for in-band full-duplex
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems using the least square (LS)
algorithm with adaptive order. The SIC and frequency downconversion are
achieved in the optical domain via a dual-parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator
(DP-MZM), while the downconverted signal is processed by the LS algorithm with
adaptive order that is used to track the response of the multipath
self-interference (SI) channel and reconstruct the reference signal for SIC.
The proposed method can overcome the reconstruction difficulty of the multipath
analog reference signal for SIC with high complexity in the MIMO scenario and
can also solve the problem that the order of the reference reconstruction
algorithm is not optimized when the wireless environment changes. An experiment
is carried out to verify the concept. 30.2, 26.9, 23.5, 19.5, and 15.8 dB SIC

that most of the single hyperparameters are either negatively or positively

found that overfitting overall tends to negatively correlate with learning

ablates parts of the sequence at a time and ask the model to perform the same
task to emulate counterfactual learning and achieve input attribution. Based on
theoretical analysis of its properties, we also propose a variant of SpanDrop
based on the beta-Bernoulli distribution, which yields diverse augmented
sequences while providing a learning objective that is more consistent with the

carefully designed toy tasks, as well as various natural language processing

dynamics of active matter systems, such as Janus microswimmers. In particular,
the analytical expression for an ABP's mean-squared-displacement (MSD) is
useful as it provides a means to describe the essential physics of a
self-propelled, spherical Brownian particle. However, the truncated or
'short-time' form of the MSD equation is typically fitted, which can lead to
significant problems in parameter estimation. Furthermore, heteroscedasticity
and the often statistically dependent observations of an ABP's MSD lead to a
situation where standard ordinary least squares (OLS) regression will obtain
biased estimates and unreliable confidence intervals. Here, we propose to
revert to always fitting the full expression of an ABP's MSD at short
timescales, using bootstrapping to construct confidence intervals of the fitted
parameters. Additionally, after comparison between different fitting
strategies, we propose to extract the physical parameters of an ABP using its
mean logarithmic squared displacement (MLSD). These steps improve the
estimation of an ABP's physical properties, and provide more reliable
confidence intervals, which are critical in the context of a growing interest
in the interactions of microswimmers with confining boundaries and the
influence on their motion.

competitive cosmological probe. The main cosmological probe with observations
of clusters is their number count, within which the halo mass function (HMF) is
a key theoretical quantity. We present a new calibration of the analytic HMF,
at the level of accuracy and precision required for the uncertainty in this
quantity to be subdominant with respect to other sources of uncertainty in
recovering cosmological parameters from Euclid cluster counts. Our model is
calibrated against a suite of N-body simulations using a Bayesian approach
taking into account systematic errors arising from numerical effects in the
simulation. First, we test the convergence of HMF predictions from different
N-body codes, by using initial conditions generated with different orders of
Lagrangian Perturbation theory, and adopting different simulation box sizes and
mass resolution. Then, we quantify the effect of using different halo-finder
algorithms, and how the resulting differences propagate to the cosmological
constraints. In order to trace the violation of universality in the HMF, we
also analyse simulations based on initial conditions characterised by
scale-free power spectra with different spectral indexes, assuming both
Einstein--de Sitter and standard $\Lambda$CDM expansion histories. Based on
these results, we construct a fitting function for the HMF that we demonstrate
to be sub-percent accurate in reproducing results from 9 different variants of
the $\Lambda$CDM model including massive neutrinos cosmologies. The calibration
systematic uncertainty is largely sub-dominant with respect to the expected
precision of future mass-observation relations; with the only notable exception
of the effect due to the halo finder, that could lead to biased cosmological
inference.

decision-making. It is thus critical to simultaneously optimize the AVs'

reinforcement learning (RL) framework to characterize efficient network
selection and autonomous driving policies in a multi-band vehicular network

frequencies. The proposed framework is designed to (i) maximize the traffic
flow and minimize collisions by controlling the vehicle's motion dynamics
(i.e., speed and acceleration) from autonomous driving perspective, and (ii)
maximize the data rates and minimize handoffs by jointly controlling the
vehicle's motion dynamics and network selection from telecommunication
perspective. We cast this problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and
develop a deep Q-learning based solution to optimize the actions such as
acceleration, deceleration, lane-changes, and AV-base station assignments for a
given AV's state. The AV's state is defined based on the velocities and
communication channel states of AVs. Numerical results demonstrate interesting
insights related to the inter-dependency of vehicle's motion dynamics,
handoffs, and the communication data rate. The proposed policies enable AVs to
adopt safe driving behaviors with improved connectivity.

real-time decisions, and this property is key to avoid catastrophic accidents.
Moreover, all the decision processes must require low power consumption, to
increase the lifetime and autonomy of battery-driven systems. These challenges
can be addressed through efficient implementations of Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs) on Neuromorphic Chips and the use of event-based cameras instead of
traditional frame-based cameras.
  In this paper, we present a new SNN-based approach, called LaneSNN, for
detecting the lanes marked on the streets using the event-based camera input.
We develop four novel SNN models characterized by low complexity and fast
response, and train them using an offline supervised learning rule. Afterward,
we implement and map the learned SNNs models onto the Intel Loihi Neuromorphic
Research Chip. For the loss function, we develop a novel method based on the
linear composition of Weighted binary Cross Entropy (WCE) and Mean Squared
Error (MSE) measures. Our experimental results show a maximum Intersection over
Union (IoU) measure of about 0.62 and very low power consumption of about 1 W.
The best IoU is achieved with an SNN implementation that occupies only 36
neurocores on the Loihi processor while providing a low latency of less than 8
ms to recognize an image, thereby enabling real-time performance. The IoU
measures provided by our networks are comparable with the state-of-the-art, but

decomposition method, i.e., Higher-Order Proper Generalized Decomposition
(HOPGD) that relies on non-intrusive data learning and construction of reduced
order surrogate models. Once calibrated, the stochastic model can be used to
predict the roughness and porosity at part scale at a significantly reduced
computational cost compared to detailed powder-scale deterministic simulations.
The stochastic simulation predictions are validated against AFRL multi-layer
and multitrack experiments and reported as more accurate when compared with
regular deterministic simulation results.

of nanoscale optics, playing an essential role for the design of devices in
plasmonics and all-dielectric nanophotonics. Challenging the traditional
division into electric and magnetic moments, toroidal moments have been
proposed as a physically distinct family of multipoles with significant
contributions to the properties of matter. However, the apparent impossibility
of separately measuring their response sheds doubt on their true physical
significance. Here, we confirm the possibility of selectively exciting toroidal
moments without any other multipole. We develop a set of general conditions
that any current distribution must fulfill to be entirely described by toroidal
moments, and prove our results in an analytically solvable case. Our new theory
allows us to design and verify experimentally for the first time an artificial
structure supporting a pure, broadband toroidal dipole response in the complete
absence of the electric dipole and other 'ordinary' multipole contributions. In
addition, we propose a structure capable of supporting a novel type of
nonradiating source, a 'toroidal anapole', originating from the destructive
interference of the toroidal dipole with the unconventional electromagnetic
sources known as mean square radii. The results in this work provide conclusive
evidence on the independent excitation of toroidal moments in electrodynamics.

describes, a measurement system based on standard optical components and a
detector able of converting single photons to an electrical signal. To verify
the model's predictions, single-point measurements for targets of different

R-squared value greater than 0.990 for simulated and measured signal amplitude
levels. Noise modeling shows good accordance with the performed measurements
for different target irradiance levels. The presented results have a guiding
significance in the modeling of the complex signal processing chain of LiDAR

dynamics, as pointed out by Poincar\'{e}. Small denominators appear most
commonly in perturbative theory. The Duffing equation is the simplest example
of a non-integrable system exhibiting all problems due to small denominators.
In this paper, using the forced Duffing equation as an example, we illustrate
that the famous ``small denominator problems'' never appear if a
non-perturbative approach based on the homotopy analysis method (HAM), namely
``the method of directly defining inverse mapping'' (MDDiM), is used. The
HAM-based MDDiM provides us great freedom to directly define the inverse
operator of an undetermined linear operator so that all small denominators can
be completely avoided and besides the convergent series of multiple
limit-cycles of the forced Duffing equation with high nonlinearity are
successfully obtained. So, from the viewpoint of the HAM, the famous ``small
denominator problems'' are only artifacts of perturbation methods. Therefore,
completely abandoning perturbation methods but using the HAM-based MDDiM, one
would be never troubled by ``small denominators''. The HAM-based MDDiM has
general meanings in mathematics and thus can be used to attack many open
problems related to the so-called ``small denominators''.

case for imaging methods relying on absorbing masks or gratings, with various
tunable properties, such as pitch, aperture size, and thickness. In this work,
we present the virtual grating approach to overcome this limitation. By
replacing the gratings in the simulation with virtual gratings, the parameters
of the gratings can be changed after the simulation, thereby significantly
reducing the overall simulation time. The method is validated by comparison to
explicit grating simulations, followed by representative demonstration cases.

  Multi-Objective Decision-Making","20 pages",,,,"math.OC cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For a long time, water and hydroelectric power are relatively important
resources. Their rational distribution is closely related to regional
agriculture, industry, residents, etc. In this paper, we mainly study the
problem of allocation scheme for Glen Canyon Dam and Hoover Dam in the Colorado
River Basin. Taking into consideration of various factors, we build models to
achieve optimal scheduling. Firstly, we propose the Water Strategy Decision
Model, which can obtain different distribution methods for the different water
levels. Also, we connect the two dams in series to consider the coupling effect
between them and integrate this part into the main model. Secondly, we propose
three criteria of allocation for water and power generation, namely, economic,
social, and environmental benefits. Social benefits mainly include the minimum
shortage of water and electricity for agriculture, industry, and residents. For
this multi-objective plan, the model is solved using a multi-objective ant
colony genetic algorithm under the constraint of constant total water volume,
and finally, the current reservoir capacities of the two lakes are input to
derive the annual water supply to the five states. Thirdly, based on the
location and development characteristics of the five states, we obtain a water
scheduling model based on the priority of geographic-industry characteristics.
Fourthly, we can regard the model as a four-dimensional space of industrial,
agricultural, residential and power generation water demand. The partial
derivative calculation formula of multi-dimensional space can be used to obtain
the results. Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of the model, and it shows
that the model has strong adaptability and is easier to popularize. Moreover,
we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the models.

the second-by-second pattern differences in the physiological arousal of
preschool-age children who do stutter (CWS) and who do not stutter (CWNS) while
speaking perceptually fluently in two challenging conditions i.e speaking in
stressful situations and narration. The first condition may affect children's
speech due to high arousal; the latter introduces linguistic, cognitive, and
communicative demands on speakers. We collected physiological parameters data
from 70 children in the two target conditions. First, we adopt a novel
modality-wise multiple-instance-learning (MI-MIL) approach to classify CWS vs.
CWNS in different conditions effectively. The evaluation of this classifier
addresses four critical research questions that align with state-of-the-art
speech science studies' interests. Later, we leverage SHAP classifier
interpretations to visualize the salient, fine-grain, and temporal
physiological parameters unique to CWS at the population/group-level and
personalized-level. While group-level identification of distinct patterns would
enhance our understanding of stuttering etiology and development, the
personalized-level identification would enable remote, continuous, and
real-time assessment of stuttering children's physiological arousal, which may
lead to personalized, just-in-time interventions, resulting in an improvement
in speech fluency. The presented MI-MIL approach is novel, generalizable to
different domains, and real-time executable. Finally, comprehensive evaluations
are done on multiple datasets, presented framework, and several baselines that
