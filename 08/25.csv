supersymmetric, or SUSY, ones.
  In this paper, we try to lift operads involving fermionic coordinates to
quantum operads. We have to restrict ourselves by lifting operads of
supersymmetric rings. We also show that $1D$ supersymmetric algebras have an
operad structure, and we analyze their symmetries, through their relation to

many neuropsychiatric disorders. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
directly alters regional activity and indirectly alters FC. Predicting how FC
will change following TMS is difficult, but would allow novel therapies that
target FC to improve symptoms. We address this challenge by proposing a
predictive model that explains how TMS-induced activation can change the
strength of FC. Here, we focus on the FC of the frontoparietal (FPS) and
default mode (DMS) systems given the importance of their FC in executive
function and affective disorders. We fit this model to neuroimaging data in 29
individuals who received TMS to the frontal cortex and evaluated the FC between
the FPS and DMS. For each individual, we measured the TMS-induced change in FC
between the FPS and DMS (the FC network), and the structural coupling between
the stimulated area and the FPS and DMS (the structural context network (SCN)).
We find that TMS-induced FC changes are best predicted when the model accounts
for white matter fibers from the stimulated area to the two systems. We find
that the correlation between these two networks (structure-function coupling) -
and therefore the predictability of the TMS-induced modulation - was highest
when the SCN contained a dense core of intraconnected regions, indicating that
the stimulated area had ample access to an anatomical module. Further, we found
that when the core of the SCN overlapped with the FPS and DMS, we observed the
greatest change in the strength of their FC. Broadly, our findings explain how
the structural connectivity of a stimulated region modulates TMS-induced
changes in the brain's functional network. Efforts to account for such
structural connections could improve predictions of TMS response, further
informing the development of TMS protocols for clinical translation.

$Re_\tau=2003$. We use the linear coherence spectrum to quantify the
wall-normal coherence within the velocity field generated by the linearized
dynamics. In addition to the linearized Navier-Stokes equations around the
turbulent mean velocity profile, we consider an enhanced variant in which
molecular viscosity is augmented with turbulent eddy-viscosity. We use
judiciously shaped white- and colored-in-time stochastic forcing to generate a
statistical response with energetic attributes that are consistent with the
result of direct numerical simulation (DNS). Specifically, white-in-time
forcing is scaled to ensure that the two-dimensional energy spectrum is
reproduced and colored-in-time forcing is shaped to match normal and shear
stress profiles. We show that the addition of eddy-viscosity significantly
strengthens the self-similar attributes of the resulting stochastic velocity
field within the logarithmic layer and leads to an inner-scaled coherence
spectrum. We use this coherence spectrum to extract the energetic signature of
self-similar motions that actively contribute to momentum transfer and are
responsible for producing Reynolds shear stress. Our findings support the use
of colored-in-time forcing in conjunction with the dynamic damping afforded by
turbulent eddy-viscosity in improving predictions of the scaling trends
associated with such active motions in accordance with DNS-based spectral
decomposition.

existence of a (global) strictly positive minimum inter-event times thereby

medium is continually perturbed by a myriad of different solar winds and storms
that transport solar material across the whole heliosphere. If there is a
consensus on the source of the fast solar wind that is known to originate in
coronal holes, the question is still largely debated on the origin of the slow
solar wind (SSW). The recent observations from the Parker Solar Probe mission
provide new insights on the nascent solar wind. And a great challenge remains
to explain both the composition and bulk properties of the SSW in a
self-consistent manner. For this purpose we exploit and develop models with
various degrees of complexity. This context constitutes the backbone of this
thesis which is structured as follows: we exploit the first images taken by the
Wide-Field Imager for Solar PRobe (WISPR) from inside the solar corona to test
our global models at smaller scales, because WISPR offers an unprecedented
close-up view of the fine structure of the nascent SSW. This work provides
further evidence for the transient release of plasma trapped in coronal loops
into the solar wind, that we interpret by exploiting high-resolution
magneto-hydrodynamics simulations. Finally we develop and exploit a new
multi-specie model of coronal loops called the Irap Solar Atmosphere Model
(ISAM) to provide an in-depth analysis of the plasma transport mechanisms at
play between the chromosphere and the corona. ISAM solves for the coupled
transport of the main constituents of the solar wind with minor ions through a
comprehensive treatment of collisions as well as partial ionization and
radiative cooling/heating mechanisms near the top of the chromosphere. We use
this model to study the different mechanisms that can preferentially extract
ions according to their first ionization potential (FIP) from the chromosphere
to the corona.

multi-point distributions in the space-time domain have been computed recently.

multi-point distributions can be expressed in terms of so-called integrable
operators. We then consider a class of operators that include the ones arising
from the KPZ and the periodic KPZ fixed points, and find that they are related

the generic agent. Given that the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP) of
the agent is communicating, we provide finite sample convergence guarantees in
terms of convergence of the mean-field and control policy to the mean-field
equilibrium. The sample complexity of the Sandbox learning algorithm is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$ where $\epsilon$ is the MFE approximation
error. This is similar to works which assume access to oracle. Finally, we

years thanks to the design of novel neural network architectures and the
availability of large scale datasets. However, current methods have a
significant limitation: they are able to detect only the classes observed
during training time, that are only a subset of all the classes that a detector
may encounter in the real world. Furthermore, the presence of unknown classes
is often not considered at training time, resulting in methods not even able to
detect that an unknown object is present in the image. In this work, we address
the problem of detecting unknown objects, known as open-set object detection.
We propose a novel training strategy, called UNKAD, able to predict unknown
objects without requiring any annotation of them, exploiting non annotated
objects that are already present in the background of training images. In
particular, exploiting the four-steps training strategy of Faster R-CNN, UNKAD
first identifies and pseudo-labels unknown objects and then uses the
pseudo-annotations to train an additional unknown class. While UNKAD can
directly detect unknown objects, we further combine it with previous unknown
detection techniques, showing that it improves their performance at no costs.

dependence of the viscosity on temperature near the transition. A continuum
model interrupted randomly by asymmetric rigid defects with orientational
degrees of freedom is considered. Such defects are orthogonal to the continuum
excitations, and are required to be imprisoned by rotational motion of the
nearby atoms of the continuum. The defects interact with an angle dependent
$\mu/r^3$ potential. A renormalization group for the elastic constants, and the
fugacity of the defects in 3D is constructed. The principal results are that
there is a scale-invariant reduction of $\mu$ as a function of length at any
temperature $T < T_0$, above which it is 0 macrosopically but has a finite
correlation length $\xi(T)$ which diverges as $T \to T_0$. Viscosity is shown
to be proportional to $\xi^2(T)$ and has the Vogel-Fulcher form. The specific

analyses (NBAs), have become a hotly researched topic in recent years. DNNs
have been wildly successful at pushing the performance and accuracy envelopes
in the natural language and image processing domains. Thus, DNNs are highly
promising for solving binary analysis problems that are typically hard due to a
lack of complete information resulting from the lossy compilation process.
Despite this promise, it is unclear that the prevailing strategy of repurposing
embeddings and model architectures originally developed for other problem
domains is sound given the adversarial contexts under which binary analysis
often operates.
  In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that the current state of the art
in neural function boundary detection is vulnerable to both inadvertent and
deliberate adversarial attacks. We proceed from the insight that current
generation NBAs are built upon embeddings and model architectures intended to
solve syntactic problems. We devise a simple, reproducible, and scalable
black-box methodology for exploring the space of inadvertent attacks -
instruction sequences that could be emitted by common compiler toolchains and
configurations - that exploits this syntactic design focus. We then show that
these inadvertent misclassifications can be exploited by an attacker, serving
as the basis for a highly effective black-box adversarial example generation
process. We evaluate this methodology against two state-of-the-art neural
function boundary detectors: XDA and DeepDi. We conclude with an analysis of
the evaluation data and recommendations for how future research might avoid
succumbing to similar attacks.

trends previously reported in a sample of star-forming MaNGA galaxies, and also
to search for spectroscopic signatures of ongoing quenching in the so-called
""Green Valley"", which is generally believed to contain galaxies that are
migrating from the star-forming (SF) population to the quenched population of
galaxies. Applying SFR$_{79}$ to our large sample of SDSS galaxies, we first
confirm the basic results of SF galaxies published by Wang & Lilly. We then
discuss in detail the calibration and meaning of SFR$_{79}$ for galaxies that
are well below the SFMS and establish what would be the expected signatures of
systematic ongoing quenching within the population. We conclude that it is not
possible at present to establish unambiguous observational evidence for
systematic ongoing quenching processes with the data at hand, due to
limitations of noise in the observational data, in particular in the
measurements of H$\delta$ absorption, and in the calibration of SFR$_{79}$, as
well as biases introduced by the necessity of selecting objects with
significant amounts of H$\alpha$ emission. We do however see plausible
indications of ongoing quenching, which are quantitatively consistent with
expectations from pertinent ""growth+quenching"" models of galaxy evolution and a
typical e-folding timescale for quenching of order $\sim500$ Myr.

with federated training seems intuitive for reducing communication costs -- by
pruning the model parameters right before the communication step. Moreover,
such a progressive model pruning approach during training can also reduce
training times/costs. To this end, we propose FedSparsify, which performs model
pruning during federated training. In our experiments in centralized and

$\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ is labeled a trap and the probability with which it is labeled
a target, are shown to have probability $0$ of culminating in draws when $p+q >
0$. We show that, for fixed $p$ and $q$, the probability of draw in each of
these games is $0$ if and only if a certain $1$-dimensional probabilistic
cellular automaton (PCA) $F_{p,q}$ with a size-$3$ neighbourhood is ergodic.
This allows us to conclude that $F_{p,q}$ is ergodic whenever $p+q > 0$,
thereby rigorously establishing ergodicity for a considerable class of PCAs.

BART-fusion, a novel model for generating lyric interpretations from lyrics and
music audio that combines a large-scale pre-trained language model with an
audio encoder. We employ a cross-modal attention module to incorporate the
audio representation into the lyrics representation to help the pre-trained
language model understand the song from an audio perspective, while preserving
the language model's original generative performance. We also release the Song
Interpretation Dataset, a new large-scale dataset for training and evaluating
our model. Experimental results show that the additional audio information
helps our model to understand words and music better, and to generate precise

retrieval shows that interpretations generated by BART-fusion can also help
people retrieve music more accurately than with the original BART.

multiplier algebra of a $C^*$-algebra. Then, we investigate the basic
properties and examples of the multiplier algebras. In order to make sense of
multiplier algebra, we establish two key results of the multiplier algebras. We
demonstrate that $M(\mathcal{S})$ is an unital Banach algebra if $\mathcal{S}$
is a left-cancellative semigroup. In the consideration, $G$ is a group, we
demonstrate that $M(G)$ is a $C^*$-algebra.
  We illustrate that the associated multiplier algebras $M(\mathbb{Z}_{+}),
M(\mathbb{Z}^2_+)$ are identified with respective Hardy algebras
$H^{\infty}(\mathbb{D})$ and $H^{\infty}(\mathbb{D}^2)$ for
$\mathcal{S}=\mathbb{Z}_{+}, \mathbb{Z}^2_{+}.$ Next, we discuss that
multiplier algebra associated to the free semigroup
$\mathcal{S}=\mathbb{F}^+_{n}$. We clearly show that the well-known
non-commutative Hardy algebra $\mathbb{F}_{n}^{\infty}$ (introduced and
thoroughly studied by G. Popescu) and the multiplier algebra
$M(\mathbb{F}_{n}^+)$ are isometrically isomorphic.
  Finally, using the operator space technique, we have demonstrated an
intriguing result that $M(\mathcal{S})$ is an operator algebra (specifically,
thanks to celebrated Blecher-Ruan-Sinclair theorem).

the transmission and storage of images. To further reduce the compression cost
while maintaining the quality of JPEG images, lossless transcoding technology
has been proposed to recompress the compressed JPEG image in the DCT domain.
Previous works, on the other hand, typically reduce the redundancy of DCT
coefficients and optimize the probability prediction of entropy coding in a
hand-crafted manner that lacks generalization ability and flexibility. To
tackle the above challenge, we propose the learned lossless JPEG transcoding
framework via Joint Lossy and Residual Compression. Instead of directly
optimizing the entropy estimation, we focus on the redundancy that exists in
the DCT coefficients. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize
the learned end-to-end lossy transform coding to reduce the redundancy of DCT
coefficients in a compact representational domain. We also introduce residual
compression for lossless transcoding, which adaptively learns the distribution
of residual DCT coefficients before compressing them using context-based
entropy coding. Our proposed transcoding architecture shows significant
superiority in the compression of JPEG images thanks to the collaboration of
learned lossy transform coding and residual entropy coding. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets have demonstrated that our proposed framework
can achieve about 21.49% bits saving in average based on JPEG compression,
which outperforms the typical lossless transcoding framework JPEG-XL by 3.51%.

in handling different cooperation regimes at the CSI sharing level, TMMSE

it is inherently not scalable. In this work, inspired by recent advances on

then successfully applied to derive a variety of novel, optimal, and efficient

  Identification of Vulnerable Nodes in Active Electrical Distribution Network",,,,,"eess.SY cs.NE cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  With the commitment to climate, globally many countries started reducing
brownfield energy production and strongly opting towards green energy
resources. However, the optimal allocation of distributed energy resources
(DERs) in electrical distribution systems still pertains as a challenging issue
to attain the maximum benefits. It happens due to the systems complex behaviour
and inappropriate integration of DERs that adversely affects the distribution
grid. In this work, we propose a methodology for the optimal allocation of DERs
with vulnerable node identification in active electrical distribution networks.
A failure or extreme event at the vulnerable node would interrupt the power
flow in the distribution network. Also, the power variation in these vulnerable
nodes would significantly affect the operation of other linked nodes. Thus,
these nodes are found suitable for the optimal placement of DERs. We
demonstrate the proposed data-driven approach on a standard IEEE-123 bus test
feeder. Initially, we partitioned the distribution system into optimal
microgrids using graph theory and graph neural network (GNN) architecture.
Further, using Granger causality analysis, we identified vulnerable nodes in
the partitioned microgrid; suitable for DERs integration. The placement of DERs
on the vulnerable nodes enhanced network reliability and resilience.
Improvement in resilience is validated by computing the percolation threshold
for the microgrid networks. The results show a 20.45% improvement in the
resilience of the system due to the optimal allocation of DERs.

7,438 are M31 sources with well measured radial velocities. The observations
reveal intricate coherent kinematic structure in the positions and velocities
of individual stars: streams, wedges, and chevrons. While hints of coherent
structures have been previously detected in M31, this is the first time they
have been seen with such detail and clarity in a galaxy beyond the Milky Way.
We find clear kinematic evidence for shell structures in the Giant Stellar
Stream, the Northeast Shelf and Western Shelf regions. The kinematics are
remarkably similar to the predictions of dynamical models constructed to
explain the spatial morphology of the inner halo. The results are consistent
with the interpretation that much of the substructure in the inner halo of M31
is produced by a single galactic immigration event 1 - 2 Gyr ago. Significant
numbers of metal-rich stars ([Fe/H]$>-0.5$) are present in all of the detected
substructures, suggesting that the immigrating galaxy had an extended star
formation history. We also investigate the ability of the shells and Giant
Stellar Stream to constrain the gravitational potential of M31, and estimate
the mass within a projected radius of 125 kpc to be ${\rm log_{10}}\, M_{\rm

the bounce of a ball that can be modelled as a rigid sphere and the surface as
supplying an elasto-plastic contact force in addition to Coulomb friction. A
general formulation is proposed that models the finite time interval of bounce
from touch-down to lift-off. Key to the analysis is understanding transitions
between slip and roll during the bounce. Starting from the rigid-body limit
with a an energetic or Poisson coefficient of restitution, it is shown that
slip reversal during the contact phase cannot be captured in this case, which
result generalises to the case of pure normal compliance. Yet, the introduction
of linear tangential stiffness and damping, does enable slip reversal. This
result is extended to general weakly nonlinear normal and tangential
compliance. An analysis using Filippov theory of piecewise-smooth systems leads
to an argument in a natural limit that lift-off while rolling is non-generic
and that almost all trajectories that lift off, do so under slip conditions.
Moreover, there is a codimension-one surface in the space of incoming velocity
and spin which divides balls that lift off with backspin from those that lift
off with topspin. The results are compared with recent experimental
measurements on golf ball bounce and the theory is shown to capture the main
features of the data.

Upper limits on the nuclearite flux for masses up to $10^{17}$ GeV/c$^{2}$ at

When a general choice of boundary geometry is immaterial in approaching the
thermodynamic limit, systems that exhibit non-commuting Gauge Like symmetries,
such as the orbital compass model, must have an exponential (in the size of the
boundary) degeneracy of each of their spectral levels. We briefly discuss why,
in spite of the proven large degeneracy associated with infrared-ultraviolet

of those of systems with non-extensive degeneracies, due to entropic ""order by

of planetary atmospheres. In the context of exoplanets, CO2 is an indicator of
the metal enrichment (i.e., elements heavier than helium, also called
""metallicity""), and thus formation processes of the primary atmospheres of hot
gas giants. It is also one of the most promising species to detect in the
secondary atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets. Previous photometric
measurements of transiting planets with the Spitzer Space Telescope have given
hints of the presence of CO2 but have not yielded definitive detections due to
the lack of unambiguous spectroscopic identification. Here we present the
detection of CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant exoplanet WASP-39b from
transmission spectroscopy observations obtained with JWST as part of the Early
Release Science Program (ERS). The data used in this study span 3.0 to 5.5
{\mu}m in wavelength and show a prominent CO2 absorption feature at 4.3 {\mu}m
(26{\sigma} significance). The overall spectrum is well matched by
one-dimensional, 10x solar metallicity models that assume
radiative-convective-thermochemical equilibrium and have moderate cloud
opacity. These models predict that the atmosphere should have water, carbon
monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide in addition to CO2, but little methane.
Furthermore, we also tentatively detect a small absorption feature near 4.0
{\mu}m that is not reproduced by these models.

  Invariant Post Randomization",,,,,"cs.CR cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A large amount of high-dimensional and heterogeneous data appear in practical
applications, which are often published to third parties for data analysis,
recommendations, targeted advertising, and reliable predictions. However,
publishing these data may disclose personal sensitive information, resulting in
an increasing concern on privacy violations. Privacy-preserving data publishing
has received considerable attention in recent years. Unfortunately, the
differentially private publication of high dimensional data remains a
challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a differentially private
high-dimensional data publication mechanism (DP2-Pub) that runs in two phases:
a Markov-blanket-based attribute clustering phase and an invariant post
randomization (PRAM) phase. Specifically, splitting attributes into several
low-dimensional clusters with high intra-cluster cohesion and low inter-cluster
coupling helps obtain a reasonable allocation of privacy budget, while a
double-perturbation mechanism satisfying local differential privacy facilitates
an invariant PRAM to ensure no loss of statistical information and thus
significantly preserves data utility. We also extend our DP2-Pub mechanism to
the scenario with a semi-honest server which satisfies local differential
privacy. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and the
experimental results demonstrate that our mechanism can significantly improve
the data utility of the published data while satisfying differential privacy.

single-site measurements in an appropriate basis on the cluster states in

correlation functions of certain $d$-dimensional classical models at finite

exact correspondence between the measurement-prepared critical states and
conformal field theories of a range of critical spin models, including familiar
Ising models and gauge theories. Furthermore, by mapping the long-range

protocols to decode the resulting quantum phases and transitions without

5$\,\mu$G, we carry out a full virial analysis including all time-independent
surface and volume terms as well as the time-dependent term. The initial
magnetic field strength influences the fragmentation properties of the forming
cloud because it prohibits motions perpendicular to the field direction and
hence alters, or even suppresses, the formation of filamentary substructures.
Molecular clump and core formation occurs anyhow. As a result, with increasing
field strength, we find more fragments with a smaller average mass; yet the
initial field strength is dynamically not relevant for the fragments which
constitute our molecular clumps and cores. %yet the magnetic field overall is
dynamically negligible for the fragments which constitute our molecular clumps

which seem to be weakly confined by ram pressure or thermal pressure,
indicating that they are swept up by the turbulent flow. They experience
significant fluctuations in the mass flux through their surface, indicating
that the Eulerian reference frame gives rise to a dominant time-dependent term

gas, which is additionally highly shielded. Most cores are in
gravitational-kinetic equipartition and are already well described by the

by the decay of heavy long-lived particles. The subsequent thermalization
occurs through the splitting of high-energy primary particles into lower-energy
daughters in primordial thermal plasma. The principal example of such processes
is reheating after inflation caused by the decay of inflatons into SM
particles. Understanding of the thermalization at reheating is extremely
important as it reveals the origin of the hot Universe, and could open up new
mechanisms for generating dark matter and/or baryon asymmetry. In this paper,
we investigate the thermalization of high-energy SM particles in thermal
plasma, taking into account the Landau--Pomeranchuk--Migdal effect in the
leading-log approximation. The whole SM particle content and all the relevant
SM interactions are included for the first time, i.e., the full gauge
interactions of SU(3)$_c\times$SU(2)$_L\times$U(1)$_Y$ and the top Yukawa
interaction. The distribution function of each SM species is computed both
numerically and analytically. We have analytically obtained the distribution
function of each SM species after the first few splittings. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that, after a sufficient number of splittings, the particle
distributions are asymptotic to certain values at low momentum, independent of
the high-energy particles injected by inflaton decay. The results are useful to
calculate the DM abundance produced during the pre-thermal phase. An example is
provided to illustrate a way to calculate the DM abundance from the scattering
between the thermal plasma and high-energy particles in the cascade.

oscillations which are superimposed on the conventional power spectra. The
frequency of these oscillations only depends on the location of the cutoff
scale and the first inflationary slow-roll parameter, while the amplitude and
phase are also moderately sensitive to how smoothly the cutoff turns on. The

enhance experimental sensitivity in observations of the cosmic microwave

challenge. While quantum error correction ultimately promises fault-tolerant
operation, the required qubit overhead and error thresholds are daunting, and
many codes break down under correlated noise. Recent proposals have suggested a
complementary approach based on co-located, auxiliary 'spectator' qubits. These
act as in-situ probes of noise, and enable real-time, coherent corrections of
the resulting errors on the data qubits. Here, we use an array of cesium
spectator qubits to correct correlated phase errors on an array of rubidium
data qubits. Crucially, by combining in-sequence readouts, data processing, and
feed-forward operations, these correlated errors are suppressed within the
execution of the quantum circuit. The protocol is broadly applicable to quantum
information platforms, and our approach establishes key tools for scaling
neutral-atom quantum processors: mid-circuit readout of atom arrays, real-time
processing and feed-forward, and coherent mid-circuit reloading of atomic
qubits.

corresponding mode structure. This leads to a non-monotonic dependence of the
emission on the frequency of the secondary star $\omega_2$, for fixed frequency
$\omega_1$ of the primary. This phenomenology, which has not been found for the

or more species can often be even critical for improving its functional
properties. To produce a highly ordered alloy, a longtime high-temperature (up
to T=1000 K) treatment of the alloy is typically necessary because of
insufficient vacancy concentration (c_v) and their mobility. However, such
processing affects the morphology and complicates the technology of functional
alloys. We show theoretically that the ordering in the practically important
FePt system (Fe_xPt_1-x with x being close to 0.5) is already achievable at
T=450 K for reasonable times t<10^3 s due to frozen nonequilibrium vacancies.
Our simulation is based on the Dienes equation for relaxation of the long-range
order parameter (S), with taking additionally into account that the ordering
kinetics in the alloy is mediated by vacancies. Importantly, the results of
such simulation are in good agreement with previous experimental data on the
ordering kinetics. We also find that nanosecond laser pulses can be employed to
achieve a sufficient level of c_v=10^-5 for effective low-temperature ordering.

starting point that semi-classical physics should be described at all times by
a point in classical phase space and a quantum state in Hilbert space, we
consider an unravelling approach, describing the system in terms of a
classical-quantum trajectory. We derive the general form of the dynamics under
the assumptions that the classical trajectories are continuous and the
evolution is autonomous, and the requirement that the dynamics is linear and
completely positive in the combined classical-quantum state. This requirement
is necessary in order to consistently describe probabilities, and forces the
dynamics to be stochastic when the back-reaction is non-zero. The resulting
equations of motion are natural generalisations of the standard semi-classical
equations of motion, but since the resulting dynamics is linear in the combined
classical-quantum state, it does not lead to the pathologies which usually
follow from evolution laws based on expectation values. In particular, the
evolution laws we present account for correlations between the classical and
quantum system, which resolves issues associated with other semi-classical
approaches. In addition, despite a breakdown of predictability in the classical
degrees of freedom, the quantum state evolves deterministically conditioned on
the classical trajectory, provided a trade-off between decoherence and
diffusion is saturated. As a result, the quantum state remains pure when
conditioned on the classical trajectory. To illustrate these points, we
numerically simulate a number of semi-classical toy models, including one of
vacuum fluctuations as a source driving the expansion of the universe. Finally,
we discuss the application of these results to semi-classical gravity, and the
black-hole information problem.

similarity. In this paper, we leverage the optimal transport theory and define
a novel task embedding for supervised classification that is model-agnostic,
training-free, and capable of handling (partially) disjoint label sets. In
short, given a dataset with ground-truth labels, we perform a label embedding
through multi-dimensional scaling and concatenate dataset samples with their
corresponding label embeddings. Then, we define the distance between two
datasets as the 2-Wasserstein distance between their updated samples. Lastly,
we leverage the 2-Wasserstein embedding framework to embed tasks into a vector
space in which the Euclidean distance between the embedded points approximates
the proposed 2-Wasserstein distance between tasks. We show that the proposed

syntheses, placing particular emphasis on the D2 line. The theoretical Stokes
profiles were obtained by numerically solving the radiative transfer problem
for polarized radiation considering one-dimensional semi-empirical models of
the solar atmosphere. The calculations account for scattering polarization,
partial frequency redistribution (PRD) effects, hyperfine structure (HFS), J-
and F-state interference, multiple isotopes, and magnetic fields of arbitrary
strength and orientation. The intensity and circular polarization profiles of
both D lines can be suitably modeled while neglecting both J-state interference
and HFS. The magnetograph formula can be applied to both lines, without
including HFS, to estimate weak longitudinal magnetic fields in the lower
chromosphere. By contrast, modeling their scattering polarization signals
requires the inclusion of HFS. The D2 scattering polarization amplitude is
strongly depolarized by HFS, but it remains measurable. An appreciable error is
incurred in the scattering polarization profile if PRD effects are not taken
into account. Collisions during scattering processes also have an appreciable
depolarizing effect. Finally, the D2 scattering polarization signal is
especially sensitive to magnetic fields with strengths around 10 G and it
strongly depends on their orientation. Despite this, its center-to-limb
variation relative to the amplitude at the limb is largely insensitive to the
field strength and orientation. These findings highlight the value of the K I
D2 line polarization for diagnostics of the solar magnetism, and show that the
linear and circular polarization signals of this line are primarily sensitive

in two and three dimensions) in which the cost function is constructed in such
a way that individual cells try to optimize their volume and surface in order
to reach a target shape. At zero temperature, many of these models exhibit a
rigidity transition that separates two phases: a liquid phase and a solid
(glassy) phase. This phenomenology is now well established but the theoretical
understanding is still not complete. In this work we consider an exactly
soluble mean field model for the rigidity transition which is based on an
abstract mapping. We replace volume and surface functions by random non-linear
functions of a large number of degrees of freedom forced to be on a compact
phase space. We then seek for a configuration of the degrees of freedom such
that these random non-linear functions all attain the same value. This target
value is a control parameter and plays the role of the target cell shape in
biological tissue models. Therefore we map the microscopic models of cells to a
random continuous constraint satisfaction problem (CCSP) with equality
constraints. We argue that at zero temperature, the rigidity transition
corresponds to the satisfiability transition of the problem. We also
characterize both the satisfiable (SAT) and unsatisfiable (UNSAT) phase. In the
SAT phase, before reaching the rigidity transition, the zero temperature SAT
landscape undergoes an RSB/ergodicity breaking transition of the same type as
the Gardner transition in amorphous solids. By solving the RSB equations we
compute the SAT/UNSAT threshold and the critical behavior around it. In the
UNSAT phase we also compute the average shape index as a function of the target
one and we compare the thermodynamical solution of the model with the results

conjugation: rather than comparing the exact states and their transitions on
attractors, we only compare the attractor structures. In general, obtaining
this information is computationally intractable. Here, we adapt and apply
combinatorial theory for dynamical systems to develop computational methods
that greatly reduce this computational cost. We give a detailed algorithm and
apply it to ($i$) the lac operon model for Escherichia coli proposed by

that it is sufficient to consider $344$ representative update orders, and, more
notably, that these $344$ representatives give rise to $4$ distinct attractor

takes into account the vector$\times$vector channel of fermion interaction with
coupling constant $G_v$, the other - the scalar$\times$scalar channel with
coupling $G_s$. At some relation between bare couplings $G_s$ and $G_v$, the
Hartree-Fock equation for self-energy of fermions can be renormalized, and
dynamical generation of the Dirac and Haldane fermion masses is possible. As a
result, phase portrait of the model consists of two nontrivial phases. In the
first one the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken due to dynamical
appearing of the Dirac mass term, while in the second phase a spontaneous
breaking of the spatial parity $\mathcal P$ is induced by Haldane mass term. It
is shown that in the particular case of pure Thirring model, i.e. at $G_s=0$,
the ground state of the system is indeed a mixture of these phases. Moreover,
it was found that dynamical generation of fermion masses is possible for any
finite number of Fermi-fields.

CO(2-1) was previously not detected. The detection and non-detection, as well
as the level of star formation (SF) activity in the region, can be explained
consistently if the clouds have the mass distribution common among Galactic
clouds, such as Orion A -- with star-forming dense clumps embedded in thick
layers of bulk molecular gas, but in a low-metallicity regime where their outer
layers are CO-deficient and CO-dark. The cloud and clump masses, estimated from
CO(3-2), range from 8.2x10^2 to 2.3x10^4 Msun and from 2.7x10^2 to 7.5x10^3
Msun, respectively. The most massive clouds appear similar to Orion A in star
formation activity as well as in mass, as expected if the cloud mass structure
is universal. The overall low SF activity in the XUV disk could be due to the
relative shortage of gas in the molecular phase. The clouds are distributed
like chains up to 600 pc (or longer) in length, suggesting that the trigger of
cloud formation is on large scales. The universal cloud mass structure also
justifies the use of high-J CO transitions to trace the total gas mass of
clouds, or galaxies, even in the high-z universe. This study is the first
demonstration that CO(3-2) is an efficient tracer of molecular clouds even in

misclassification errors widely vary in cost. However, over-parameterization

can render a DNN, evaluated purely on the training set, ineffective in
distinguishing a cost-sensitive solution from its overall accuracy maximization
counterpart. This necessitates rethinking cost-sensitive classification in

adversarial data augmentation (CSADA) framework to make over-parameterized

examples that push the decision boundary in cost-aware directions. These
targeted adversarial samples are generated by maximizing the probability of
critical misclassifications and used to train a model with more conservative
decisions on costly pairs. Experiments on well-known datasets and a pharmacy

effectively minimize the overall cost and reduce critical errors, while

standard distributional approximations may be invalid due to singularities in
the null hypothesis. We propose a general testing methodology that aims to
circumvent these difficulties. The polynomials are estimated by incomplete
U-statistics, and we derive critical values by Gaussian multiplier bootstrap.
We prove that the bootstrap approximation of incomplete U-statistics is valid
independently of the degeneracy of the kernel when the number of combinations
used to compute the incomplete U-statistic is of the same order as the sample
size. It follows that our test controls type I error over the whole parameter
space and, in particular, it is valid at singularities. Furthermore, the
bootstrap approximation covers high-dimensional settings making our testing
strategy applicable for problems with many constraints. We study empirical size
and power of the proposed tests in numerical experiments that assess the
goodness-of-fit of latent tree models. Our implementation of the tests is
available in an R package.

models revolved around performance improvements on NLU tasks in GLUE. To
evaluate language models in other languages, several language-specific GLUE
datasets were created. The area of speech language understanding (SLU) has
followed a similar trajectory. The success of large self-supervised models such
as wav2vec2 enable creation of speech models with relatively easy to access
unlabelled data. These models can then be evaluated on SLU tasks, such as the
SUPERB benchmark. In this work, we extend this to Indic languages by releasing
the IndicSUPERB benchmark. Specifically, we make the following three
contributions. (i) We collect Kathbath containing 1,684 hours of labelled
speech data across 12 Indian languages from 1,218 contributors located in 203
districts in India. (ii) Using Kathbath, we create benchmarks across 6 speech
tasks: Automatic Speech Recognition, Speaker Verification, Speaker
Identification (mono/multi), Language Identification, Query By Example, and
Keyword Spotting for 12 languages. (iii) On the released benchmarks, we train
and evaluate different self-supervised models alongside a commonly used
baseline FBANK. We show that language-specific fine-tuned models are more
accurate than baseline on most of the tasks, including a large gap of 76\% for
the Language Identification task. However, for speaker identification,

interatomic electron hopping that can be either positive or negative and
further tuned by spin-orbit coupling, interatomic spring constant is positive,

Surprisingly, we found that topological phonon flat bands (FBs) can manifest
either a positive or negative interatomic spring constant that couples the
FB-modes of opposite chirality, as exemplified by first-principles calculations
of a 2D material of Kagome-BN. To reveal its physical origin, we first
establish a fundamental correspondence between a collective lattice-coupling
(CLC) variable of two quasi-particle states (e.g., electronic states or phonon
modes) of opposite parity in a periodic lattice with band topology. Topological
semimetals arise with zero CLC at special k-points protected by symmetry; while
positive and negative CLC at these k-points gives rise to normal and
topological insulators, respectively. Then, we show topological FB has a
special form of CLC that vanishes at all k-points as characterized by its
real-space wave function, and multi-atom FB phonon mode can manifest
effectively a negative interatomic spring constant. Our findings shed new light
on our fundamental understanding of topology and provide a practical design

currents encompassing all ocean basins, crucial to the Earth's climate.
Detecting potential climatic changes in the MOC first requires a careful
characterisation of its inherent variability. Key components of the MOC are the
Atlantic MOC (AMOC) and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The role of
boundary properties in determining the AMOC and ACC is investigated, as a
function of cross-sectional coordinate and depth, using a hierarchy of general
circulation models. The AMOC is decomposed as the sum of near-surface Ekman,
depth-independent bottom velocity and eastern and western boundary density
components. The decomposition proves a useful low-dimensional characterisation
of the full 3-D overturning circulation. The estimated total basin-wide AMOC
overturning streamfunction, reconstructed using only boundary information, is
in good agreement with direct calculations of the overturning using meridional
velocities. The time-mean maximum overturning streamfunction is relatively
constant with latitude, despite its underlying boundary contributions varying
considerably, especially in the northern hemisphere. Applying a similar
decomposition diagnostic to the ACC provides insight into the differences
between model simulations, revealing spatial resolution dependence of ACC
transport through the Drake Passage. All models exhibit a weak ACC compared to
observations. Density maps along sloping ocean boundaries are produced,
incorporating the western and eastern Atlantic boundaries and the Antarctic
coastline. Isopycnals are flat over long portions of eastern ocean boundaries,
and slope linearly on western boundaries. Results of this thesis serve to
indicate the importance of boundary information in characterising the AMOC and
the ACC, and the relative simplicity of along-sloping-boundary density
structure.

demonstrate the failure of the Dirac-Bergmann theory for the quantization of

perturbative Born-Oppenheimer analysis. We rigorously prove the validity of the
corresponding perturbation theory using Kato-Rellich theory. We find that the
singular limit of this regularized analysis is, in many cases, completely
unlike the singular theory. Dirac-Bergmann, which uses the Kirchhoff's (and
Tellegen's) laws to deal with constraints, predicts dynamics that depend on the
detailed parameters of nonlinear circuit elements, e.g., Josephson inductances.

regularized Born-Oppenheimer approach exhibits a fixed point structure, flowing
to one of a few universal fixed points as parasitic capacitance values go to

end, we created a challenge dataset of edited facial images to assist the
research community in developing novel approaches to address and classify the
authenticity of digital media. Our dataset includes edits applied to
controlled, portrait-style frontal face images and full-scene in-the-wild
images that may include multiple (i.e., more than one) face per image. The
goals of our dataset is to address the following challenge questions: (1) Can
we determine the authenticity of a given image (edit detection)? (2) If an
image has been edited, can we \textit{localize} the edit region? (3) If an
image has been edited, can we deduce (classify) what edit type was performed?
The majority of research in image forensics generally attempts to answer item
(1), detection. To the best of our knowledge, there are no formal datasets
specifically curated to evaluate items (2) and (3), localization and
classification, respectively. Our hope is that our prepared evaluation protocol
will assist researchers in improving the state-of-the-art in image forensics as
they pertain to these challenges.

random walks in continuous-space characterised by waiting-times with finite
mean and by jump-sizes with both finite mean and finite variance. In the
asymptotic limit, this well-controlled process is governed by an
advection-diffusion equation and the MFPT results to be finite when the
advecting velocity is in the direction of the boundary. We derive a
nonhomogeneous Wiener-Hopf integral equation that allows for the exact
calculation of the MFPT by avoiding asymptotic limits and it emerges to depend
on the whole distribution of the jump-sizes and on the mean-value only of the
waiting-times, thus it holds for general non-Markovian random walks. Through
the case study of a quite general family of asymmetric distributions of the
jump-sizes that is exponential towards the boundary and arbitrary in the
opposite direction, we show that the MFPT is indeed independent of the
jump-sizes distribution in the opposite direction to the boundary. Moreover, we
show also that there exists a length-scale, which depends only on the features
of the distribution of jumps in the direction of the boundary, such that for
starting points near the boundary the MFPT depends on the specific whole
distribution of jump-sizes, in opposition to the universality emerging for
starting points far-away from the boundary.

resulted in an extraordinary capacity to identify motor unit spike trains from
the surface of a muscle. These EMG grid, or high-density surface EMG (HDsEMG),
recordings now provide accurate depictions of as many as 20-30 motor unit spike
trains simultaneously during isometric contractions, even at high forces. Such
multi-unit recordings often display an unexpected feature known as onion skin
behavior, in which multiple motor unit spike trains show essentially parallel
and organized increases in discharge rate with increases in voluntary force,
such that the earliest recruited units reach the highest discharge rates, while
higher threshold units display more modest rate increases. This sequence
results in an orderly pattern of discharge resembling the layers of an onion,
in which discharge rate trajectories stay largely parallel and rarely cross.
Our objective in this review is to explain why this pattern of discharge rates

motoneuron electrophysiology, and why it may potentially lead to unpredicted
disruption in muscle force generation. This review is aimed at the practicing

leakage errors to first order, which is particularly interesting for encoded

remarkable exchange pulse error of $5\times10^{-5}$. This sequence maintains a

theory through a communication complexity framework, measuring the expected
number of bits elicited from the agents; we posit that any valuation can be
expressed with $k$ bits, and we mainly assume that $k$ is independent of the
number of agents $n$. In this context, we show that Vickrey's rule can be
implemented with an expected communication of $1 + \epsilon$ bits from an
average bidder, for any $\epsilon > 0$, asymptotically matching the trivial
lower bound. As a corollary, we provide a compelling method to increment the
price in an English auction. We also leverage our single-item format with an
efficient encoding scheme to prove that the same communication bound can be
recovered in the domain of additive valuations through simultaneous ascending
auctions, assuming that the number of items is a constant. Finally, we propose
an ascending-type multi-unit auction under unit demand bidders; our mechanism
announces at every round two separate prices and is based on a sampling
algorithm that performs approximate selection with limited communication,
leading again to asymptotically optimal communication. Our results do not
require any prior knowledge on the agents' valuations, and mainly follow from
natural sampling techniques.

empirically illustrate that a less skewed singular value distribution can

was first selected as an observatory location, and how future-proof the site
might be to continued change. We use data from a range of sources, including
in-situ meteorological observations, radiosonde profiles, and numerical
reanalyses to construct a climatology at Maunakea over the previous 40 years.
We are interested in both the meteorological conditions (e.g., wind speed and
humidity), and the image quality (e.g., seeing). We find that meteorological
conditions were, in general, relatively stable over the period with few
statistically significant trends and with quasi-cyclical inter-annual
variability in astronomically significant parameters such as temperature and
precipitable water vapour. We do, however, find that maximum wind speeds have
increased over the past decades, with the frequency of wind speeds above
15~m~s$^{-1}$ increasing in frequency by 1--2%, which may have a significant
impact on ground-layer turbulence. Importantly, we find that the Fried
parameter has not changed in the last 40 years, suggesting there has not been
an increase in optical turbulence strength above the summit. Ultimately, more
data and data sources-including profiling instruments-are needed at the site to

arises from material and photonic space truncation can pose significant
challenges to conventional quantum optical models when matter and light
strongly hybridize. In structured photonic environments, necessary in practice
to achieve strong light-matter coupling, a rigorous model of field quantization
within the medium is also needed. Here, we use the framework of macroscopic QED
by quantizing the fields in an arbitrary material system, with a
spatially-dependent dispersive and absorptive dielectric, starting from a
fundamental light-matter action. We truncate the material and mode degrees of
freedom while respecting the gauge principle by imposing a partial gauge fixing
constraint during canonical quantization, which admits a large number of gauges
including the Coulomb and multipolar gauges. We also consider gauge conditions
with explicit time-dependence, enabling us to unambiguously introduce
phenomenologically time-dependent light-matter interactions in any gauge. Our
results allow one to derive rigorous models of ultrastrong light-matter
interactions in structured photonic environments with no gauge ambiguity.
Results for two-level systems and the dipole approximation are discussed, as
well as how to go beyond the dipole approximation for effective single-particle
models. By comparing with the limiting case of an inhomogeneous dielectric,
where dispersion and absorption can be neglected and the fields can be expanded
in terms of the generalized transverse eigenfunctions of the dielectric, we
show how lossy systems can introduce an additional gauge ambiguity, which we
resolve and predict to have fundamental implications for open quantum system
models. Finally, we show how observables in mode-truncated systems can be
calculated without ambiguity by using a simple gauge-invariant photodetection
model.

computational problems that are otherwise intractable on classical computers;
however, for the next decade or so, our access is restricted to noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers and, perhaps, early fault tolerant
(EFT) quantum computers. This motivates the development of many near-term
quantum algorithms including robust amplitude estimation (RAE), which is a
quantum-enhanced algorithm for estimating expectation values. One obstacle to
using RAE has been a paucity of ways of getting realistic error models
incorporated into this algorithm. So far the impact of device noise on RAE is
incorporated into one of its subroutines as an exponential decay model, which
is unrealistic for NISQ devices and, maybe, for EFT devices; this hinders the
performance of RAE. Rather than trying to explicitly model realistic noise
effects, which may be infeasible, we circumvent this obstacle by tailoring
device noise to generate an effective noise model, whose impact on RAE closely
resembles that of the exponential decay model. Using noisy simulations, we show
that our noise-tailored RAE algorithm is able to regain improvements in both
bias and precision that are expected for RAE. Additionally, on IBM's quantum
computer our algorithm demonstrates advantage over the standard estimation
technique in reducing bias. Thus, our work extends the feasibility of RAE on
NISQ computers, consequently bringing us one step closer towards achieving
quantum advantage using these devices.

applications. However, most existing literature focuses mainly on the average
treatment effects. When the individual effects are heavy-tailed or have outlier
values, not only may the average effect not be appropriate for summarizing the
treatment effects, but also the conventional inference for it can be sensitive
and possibly invalid due to poor large-sample approximations. In this paper we
focus on quantiles of individual effects, which can be more robust measures of
treatment effects in the presence of extreme individual effects. Moreover, our
inference for quantiles of individual effects are purely randomization-based,
which avoids any distributional assumption on the units. We first consider
inference for stratified randomized experiments, extending the recent work of
Caughey et al. (2021). The calculation of valid $p$-values for testing null
hypotheses on quantiles of individual effects involves linear integer
programming, which is generally NP hard. To overcome this issue, we propose a
greedy algorithm with a certain optimal transformation, which has much lower
computational cost, still leads to valid $p$-values and is less conservative
than the usual relaxation by dropping the integer constraint. We then extend
our approach to matched observational studies and propose sensitivity analysis
to investigate to what extent our inference on quantiles of individual effects
is robust to unmeasured confounding. Both the randomization inference and
sensitivity analysis are simultaneously valid for all quantiles of individual
effects, which are actually free lunches added to the conventional analysis
assuming constant effects. Furthermore, the inference results can be easily
visualized and interpreted.

whether this explanation of the 'ice in the fire' puzzle applies only to the

with an electric field model, we numerically investigate the performance and
enhancement mechanism of pool boiling of dielectric fluids on pillar-structured
surfaces under an electric field. The numerical investigation reveals that
applying an electric field causes both positive and negative influences on the
pool boiling of dielectric fluids on pillar-structured surfaces. It is found
that, under the action of an electric field, the electric force prevents the
bubbles nucleated in the channels from crossing the edges of the pillar tops.
On the one hand, such an effect results in the bubble coalescence in the
channels and blocks the paths of liquid supply for the channels, which leads to
the deterioration of pool boiling in the medium-superheat regime. On the other
hand, it prevents the coalescence between the bubbles in the channels and those
on the pillar tops, which suppresses the formation of a continuous vapor film
and therefore delays the occurrence of boiling crisis. Meanwhile, the electric
force can promote the departure of the bubbles on the pillar tops. Accordingly,
the critical heat flux (CHF) can be improved. Based on the revealed mechanism,
wettability-modified regions are applied to the pillar tops for further
enhancing the boiling heat transfer. It is shown that the boiling performance
on pillar-structured surfaces can be enhanced synergistically with the CHF
being increased by imposing an electric field and the maximum heat transfer
coefficient being improved by applying mixed wettability to the
pillar-structured surfaces.

energy degrees of freedom is examined. After adding a set of 2 MeV
neutron-induced 239Pu fission yield data into the yield tensor, the 2 MeV
neutron-induced fission yields of 235U and 239Pu are predicted. The comparison
with the experimental data shows that the predictions are similar to those by
the GEF model in the peak area but more accurate in the valley area. Finally,
the yields of the ratio of isomeric states and neutron excess of the products
as a function of product charge number are also studied. The FYTD model can
capture the multi-dimensional dependence of the fission yield data and make
reasonable predictions.

formation time scales and photometric redshifts (photo-zs) of the UDGs studied.
Using the mid-infrared data, we probe the existence of dust in UDGs. Although
its presence cannot be confirmed, we find that the inclusion of small amounts
of dust in the models brings the stellar populations closer to those reported
with spectroscopy. Additionally, we fit the redshifts of all galaxies. We find
a high accuracy in recovering photo-zs compared to spectroscopy, allowing us to
provide new photo-z estimates for three field UDGs with unknown distances. We
find evidence of a stellar population dependence on the environment, with
quiescent field UDGs being systematically younger than their cluster
counterparts. Lastly, we find that all UDGs lie below the mass--metallicity
relation for normal dwarf galaxies. Particularly, the globular cluster
(GC)-poor UDGs are consistently more metal-rich than GC-rich ones, suggesting
that GC-poor UDGs may be puffed-up dwarfs, while most GC-rich UDGs are better
explained by a failed galaxy scenario. As a byproduct, we show that two
galaxies in our sample, NGC 1052-DF2 and NGC 1052-DF4, share equivalent stellar
population properties, with ages consistent with 8 Gyr. This finding supports

polynomial interpolation, which contains Lagrange interpolation and Newton
interpolation, which are essential but critical. Then we introduce a typical
stepwise linear interpolation - Neville's algorithm. If we are concerned about
the derivative, it comes to Hermite interpolation; if we focus on smoothness,
it comes to cubic splines and Chebyshev nodes. Finally, in the Data fitting

the impulse response analysis but the heterogeneous effects the IV may identify
are rarely discussed. In microeconometrics, on the other hand, it is well
understood that an IV identifies the local average treatment effect (Imbens and
Angrist, 1994). Recognizing that macro shocks are often composites (e.g., the
government spending shock is the sum of sectoral spending shocks), we show that
the IV estimand can be written as a weighted average of componentwise impulse
responses. Negative weights can arise if the correlations between the IV and
the components of the macro shock have different signs. This implies that the
response of the variable of interest to an IV shock may evolve in an arbitrary
way regardless of the true underlying componentwise impulse responses. We
provide conditions under which the IV estimand has a structural interpretation.
When additional IVs or auxiliary disaggregated data are available, we derive
informative bounds on the componentwise impulse responses. With multiple IVs
and disaggregated data, the impulse responses can be point-identified. To
demonstrate the empirical relevance of our theory, we revisit the IV estimation
of the government spending multiplier in the US. We show that the non-defense
spending multiplier larger than one can be obtained from the conventional IV
estimates of the aggregate spending multiplier, which are smaller than one.

boundary conditions. Three Reynolds numbers, $\Rey=100$, 200 and 300 are
considered to reveal the roles of the intrinsic secondary instabilities and the
extrinsic end boundary effects in shaping the three-dimensional flows. At
$\Rey=100$, the end boundary effects are felt over the entire cylinder span by
inducing oblique vortex shedding, which is associated with stronger spanwise
flow in the wake than a parallel shedding. The Strouhal number of the oblique
shedding is related to that of the parallel shedding of straight cylinder by
the cosine law, considering the combined inclination angle and oblique angle.
At $\Rey=200$, the intrinsic secondary instability results in large-scale
vortex dislocation, precluding the propagation of the end boundary effects
towards further span. Nevertheless, for the inclined cases, oblique shedding is
still observed within limited span from the upstream end boundary. The oblique
vortices are related to the two-dimensional flow at $\Rey=200$ from the
viewpoint of cosine law. Further along the span, the oblique vortices
destabilizes with the formation of small-scale vortices, and the flow
transitions to the typical mode A* wake. At $\Rey=300$, the highly
three-dimensional flow near the end boundary creates disturbances that travel
along the cylinder span, creating vortex dislocations for cases with low
inclination angles. For high inclination angle, oblique vortex shedding is
again observed over the cylinder span, and is not disrupted by vortex
dislocations of either intrinsic or extrinsic causes.

detector performance, including dark currents lower than 1 e-/pixel/kilosecond,
read noise less than 1 e-/pixel/frame, and large formats. There are currently
no infrared detectors that meet these requirements. The University of Hawaii
and industrial partners are developing one promising technology, linear mode
avalanche photodiodes (LmAPDs), using fine control over the HgCdTe bandgap
structure to enable noise-free charge amplification and minimal glow.
  Here we report first results of a prototype megapixel format LmAPD operated
in our cryogenic testbed. At 50 Kelvin, we measure a dark current of about 3
e-/pixel/kilosecond, which is due to an intrinsic dark current consistent with
zero (best estimate of 0.1 e-/pixel/kilosecond) and a ROIC glow of 0.08
e-/pixel/frame. The read noise of these devices is about 10 e-/pixel/frame at 3
volts, and decreases by 30% with each additional volt of bias, reaching 2 e- at
8 volts. Upcoming science-grade devices are expected to substantially improve
upon these figures, and address other issues uncovered during testing.

We implicitly represent the object's geometry as a neural network, while the
polarization render is capable of rendering the object's polarization images
from the given shape and illumination configuration. Direct comparison of the
rendered polarization images to the real-world captured images will have
additional errors due to the transmission in the transparent object. To address
this issue, the concept of reflection percentage which represents the
proportion of the reflection component is introduced. The reflection percentage
is calculated by a ray tracer and then used for weighting the polarization
loss. We build a polarization dataset for multi-view transparent shapes

often infeasible when an environment has sparse and non-Markovian rewards.
Moreover, handcrafting these reward functions before training is prone to

specifications as succinct finite-state `task automata' from episodes of agent
experience within unknown environments. We leverage two key algorithmic
insights. First, we learn a product MDP, a model composed of the
specification's automaton and the environment's MDP (both initially unknown),
by treating the product MDP as a partially observable MDP and using the
well-known Baum-Welch algorithm for learning hidden Markov models. Second, we
propose a novel method for distilling the task automaton (assumed to be a
deterministic finite automaton) from the learnt product MDP. Our learnt task
automaton enables the decomposition of a task into its constituent sub-tasks,
which improves the rate at which an RL agent can later synthesise an optimal
policy. It also provides an interpretable encoding of high-level environmental
and task features, so a human can readily verify that the agent has learnt
coherent tasks with no misspecifications. In addition, we take steps towards
ensuring that the learnt automaton is environment-agnostic, making it
well-suited for use in transfer learning. Finally, we provide experimental
results compared with two baselines to illustrate our algorithm's performance

this work, data-driven Machine Learning approaches for learning the underlying

established continuum models and (b) used to infer chemotactic PDEs from

bacterial density evolution, and even possibly recovering estimates of the

low-dimensionality of the dynamics (in the spirit of the Whitney and Takens

eutectic phase diagram with temperatures up to 3400 K, which includes liquid
phases. The NNP is trained over trajectories of various solid and liquid phases
at several compositions that are calculated within the density functional
theory (DFT). For the exchange-correlation energy among electrons, we compare
the PBE and SCAN functionals. The phase boundaries such as solidus, solvus, and
liquidus are determined by free-energy calculations based on the thermodynamic
integration or semigrand ensemble methods, and salient features in the phase
diagram such as solubility limit and eutectic points are well reproduced. In
particular, the phase diagram produced by the SCAN-NNP closely follows the
experimental data, exhibiting both eutectic composition and temperature within
the measurements. On a rough estimate, the whole procedure is more than 1,000
times faster than pure-DFT based approaches. We believe that this work paves

makes accuracy worse when given uncurated unlabeled data. Recent complex
remedies try to detect out-of-distribution unlabeled images and then discard or
downweight them. Instead, we introduce Fix-A-Step, a simpler procedure that
views all uncurated unlabeled images as potentially helpful. Our first insight
is that even uncurated images can yield useful augmentations of labeled data.
Second, we modify gradient descent updates to prevent optimizing a multi-task
SSL loss from hurting labeled-set accuracy. Fix-A-Step can repair many common

significant influence on neural network training. Learning rate schedules are
widely used in real practice to adjust the learning rate according to
pre-defined schedules for fast convergence and good generalization. However,
existing learning rate schedules are all heuristic algorithms and lack
theoretical support. Therefore, people usually choose the learning rate
schedules through multiple ad-hoc trials, and the obtained learning rate
schedules are sub-optimal. To boost the performance of the obtained sub-optimal
learning rate schedule, we propose a generic learning rate schedule plugin,
called LEArning Rate Perturbation (LEAP), which can be applied to various
learning rate schedules to improve the model training by introducing a certain
perturbation to the learning rate. We found that, with such a simple yet
effective strategy, training processing exponentially favors flat minima rather
than sharp minima with guaranteed convergence, which leads to better
generalization ability. In addition, we conduct extensive experiments which
show that training with LEAP can improve the performance of various deep
learning models on diverse datasets using various learning rate schedules

wireless communication systems aided by a single passive IRS, which, however,
has limited control over wireless propagation environment and suffers from
product-distance path-loss. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a
new hybrid active/passive IRS aided wireless communication system, where an
active IRS and multiple passive IRSs are deployed to assist the communication
between a base station (BS) and a remote user in complex environment, by
establishing a multihop reflection path across active/passive IRSs. In
particular, the active IRS enables signal reflection with power amplification,
thus effectively compensating the severe path-loss in the multi-reflection
path. To maximize the achievable rate at the user, we first design the optimal
beamforming of the BS and selected (active/passive) IRSs for a given
multi-reflection path, and then propose an efficient algorithm to obtain the
optimal multi-reflection path by using the path decomposition method and graph
theory. We show that the active IRS should be selected to establish the beam
routing path when its amplification power and/or number of active reflecting
elements are sufficiently large. Last, numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed hybrid active/passive IRS beam routing design as
compared to the benchmark scheme with passive IRSs only.

radiative flux transferred in such an anisotropic planar system, a general
Green-function-based approach is offered, which allows one to investigate the
radiative heat transfer in arbitrary manybody systems with planar geometry. We
demonstrate that, under specific choices of the geometrical and thermal

near-field energy transfer in three-element MO planar systems, depending on the
interplay between the damped evanescent fields of the zero-field surface waves

real-time, such as glacial retreat. Timelapse videography is a common approach
to summarizing long videos and visualizing slow timescales. However, a
timelapse is limited to a single chosen temporal frequency, and often appears
flickery due to aliasing and temporal discontinuities between frames. In this
paper, we propose Video Temporal Pyramids, a technique that addresses these
limitations and expands the possibilities for visualizing the passage of time.
Inspired by spatial image pyramids from computer vision, we developed an
algorithm that builds video pyramids in the temporal domain. Each level of a
Video Temporal Pyramid visualizes a different timescale; for instance, videos
from the monthly timescale are usually good for visualizing seasonal changes,
while videos from the one-minute timescale are best for visualizing sunrise or
the movement of clouds across the sky. To help explore the different pyramid
levels, we also propose a Video Spectrogram to visualize the amount of activity
across the entire pyramid, providing a holistic overview of the scene dynamics
and the ability to explore and discover phenomena across time and timescales.

result, an enemy may enter from any point absence of surveillance and cause the
loss of lives or destroy the military establishments. WSNs can be a feasible
solution for the problem of intrusion detection and surveillance at the border

hierarchical mergers, with at least one of the black holes (BHs) being the
remnant of a previous merger. A primary condition for the occurrence of
hierarchical mergers is that the remnant BHs can be retained by the host star
cluster. We present a simple formula to estimate the hierarchical merger rate
in star clusters. We find this latter to be proportional to the retention
probability. Further, we show that $\sim 2\%$ of BBH mergers in nuclear star
clusters (NSCs) may instead be of hierarchical mergers, while the percentage in
globular clusters (GCs) is only a few tenths of a percent. However, the rates
of hierarchical merger in GCs and NSCs are about the same, namely of $\sim
{\mathcal O(10^{-2})}~{\rm Gpc^{-3}~yr^{-1}}$, because the total BBH merger
rate in GCs is larger than that in NSCs. This suggests that if a
gravitational-wave event detected by LIGO-Virgo is identified as a hierarchical
merger, then it is equally likely that this merger originated from a GC or an
NSC.

systems; adequate subsequent annealing had a positive influence. The
as-deformed states, as well as microstructural changes upon thermal treatments,
were studied using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction

observed for all as-deformed samples, indicating the formation of a
supersaturated solid solution. However, judging from the presence of the
granular giant-magnetoresistive effect, small ferromagnetic particles have to
be present. The highest drop in room temperature resistivity (2.45% at 1790

Combining the results of classical microstructural studies and magnetic

equations in Mino time from which the angular and radial potentials can be

of the radial potential with an emphasis on the effect from the charge of the
black holes. We then obtain the solutions of the trajectories in terms of the
elliptical integrals and the Jacobian elliptic functions for both null and
time-like geodesics, which are manifestly real functions of the Mino time that
the initial conditions can be explicitly specified. We also describe the
details of how to reduce those solutions into the cases of the spherical
orbits. The effect of the black hole's charge decreases the radii of the
spherical motion of the light and the particle for both direct and retrograde
motions. In particular, we focus on the light/particle boomerang of the
spherical orbits due to the frame dragging from the back hole's spin with the
effect from the charge of the black hole. To sustain the change of the
azimuthal angle of the light rays, say for example $\Delta \phi=\pi$ during the
whole trip, the presence of the black hole's charge decreases the radius of the
orbit and consequently reduces the needed values of the black hole's spin. As
for the particle boomerang, the particle's inertia renders smaller change of
the angle $\Delta \phi$ as compared with the light boomerang. Moreover, the
black hole's charge also results in the smaller angle change $\Delta \phi$ of
the particle than that in the Kerr case. The implications of the obtained

Their
pulsation frequencies allow us to probe the internal structure of stars. One of

Therefore, in the current study, we focused on the discovery of $\delta$ Scuti
stars. For this investigation, we followed some criteria. First, we inspected
TESS database by eye and discovered some single stars that exhibit
pulsation-like behaviour. Our second criterion is $T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log g$
range. The $\delta$ Scuti stars generally have $T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log g$ value
in a range of 6300\,$-$\,8500\,K and 3.2\,$-$\,4.3, respectively. Hence, we
selected the stars which have TIC $T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log g$ values in these
ranges. The other criterion is the pulsating frequency. A frequency analysis
was performed for all the candidate stars. In addition, $M_{V}$, $L$ and also
$M_{bol}$ parameters of the target stars were determined to calculate the
pulsation constants and show their positions in the H-R diagram. The final
pulsation type classification was made by considering the frequency ranges and
pulsation constants of the stars. As a result of the study, five $\delta$
Scuti, one $\gamma$ Doradus and four hybrid systems were discovered.

frequency (ENF) only utilize the static spatial information of ENF, ignoring
the variation of ENF in time series, which limit the ability of ENF feature
representation and reduce the accuracy of tampering detection. This paper
proposes a new method for digital audio tampering detection based on ENF
spatio-temporal features representation learning. A parallel spatio-temporal
network model is constructed using CNN and BiLSTM, which deeply extracts ENF
spatial feature information and ENF temporal feature information to enhance the
feature representation capability to improve the tampering detection accuracy.
In order to extract the spatial and temporal features of the ENF, this paper
firstly uses digital audio high-precision Discrete Fourier Transform analysis
to extract the phase sequences of the ENF. The unequal phase series is divided
into frames by adaptive frame shifting to obtain feature matrices of the same
size to represent the spatial features of the ENF. At the same time, the phase
sequences are divided into frames based on ENF time changes information to
represent the temporal features of the ENF. Then deep spatial and temporal
features are further extracted using CNN and BiLSTM respectively, and an
attention mechanism is used to adaptively assign weights to the deep spatial
and temporal features to obtain spatio-temporal features with stronger
representation capability. Finally, the deep neural network is used to
determine whether the audio has been tampered with. The experimental results
show that the proposed method improves the accuracy by 2.12%-7.12% compared

broken at rate $\omega$. Then, with probability $\alpha$, $S$ rewires this edge
to another uniformly chosen vertex; and with probability $1-\alpha$, this edge
is simply dropped. When $\alpha=1$ the SIR-$\omega$ model becomes the evoSIR
model. Jiang et al. proved in \cite{DOMath} that the probability of an outbreak
in the evoSIR model converges to 0 as $\lambda$ approaches the critical
infection rate $\lambda_c$. On the other hand, numerical experiments in

referred to as a discontinuous phase transition. In \cite{BB} Ball and Britton
give two (non-matching) conditions for continuous and discontinuous phase

distribution of the test statistics, while conditioned on the mean vector
$\boldsymbol{\mu}$. Rest of the set up is identical to Bogdan et.al. (2011)

marginal variances to decompose the test statistics into independent random
variables. We then identify a set of independent yet unobservable gaussian
random variables sufficient for the multiple testing problem and chalk out the
necessary and sufficient conditions for single cutoff tests to be ABOS based on
those dummy variables following Bogdan et.al. (2011). Further we replaced the
dummy variables with deviations of the statistics from their arithmetic means
which were easily calculable from the observations due to the decomposition
used earlier. Additional assumptions are then derived so that the necessary and
sufficient conditions for single cutoff tests to be ABOS using the independent
dummy variables plays the same role with the replacement variable as well (with
a deviation of order $o(1)$). Next with the same additional assumption,
necessary and sufficient conditions for single cutoff tests to control the
Bayesian FDRs are derived and as a consequence under various sparsity
assumptions we proved that the classical Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg
methods of multiple testing are ABOS if the same conditions are satisfied.

of sleep state fluctuations in neonatal intensive care units.
  Methods: A deep learning -based algorithm was designed and trained using 53
EEG recordings from a long-term (a)EEG monitoring in 30 near-term neonates. The
results were validated using an external dataset from 30 polysomnography
recordings. In addition to training and validating a single EEG channel quiet
sleep detector, we constructed Sleep State Trend (SST), a bedside-ready means
for visualizing classifier outputs.
  Results: The accuracy of quiet sleep detection in the training data was 90%,
and the accuracy was comparable (85-86%) in all bipolar derivations available
from the 4-electrode recordings. The algorithm generalized well to an external
dataset, showing 81% overall accuracy despite different signal derivations. SST
allowed an intuitive, clear visualization of the classifier output.
  Conclusions: Fluctuations in sleep states can be detected at high fidelity
from a single EEG channel, and the results can be visualized as a transparent
and intuitive trend in the bedside monitors.
  Significance: The Sleep State Trend (SST) may provide caregivers a real-time
view of sleep state fluctuations and its cyclicity.

This is no different for the South African Iron Ore line. Many rail breaks

redshift range of $0.1 \leq z \leq 0.35$) using photometry data from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16, where cluster richness can be used as a
proxy for cluster mass. In order to reliably estimate cluster richness, it is
vital that the background subtraction is as accurate as possible when
distinguishing cluster and field galaxies to mitigate severe contamination.
AutoEnRichness is comprised of a multi-stage machine learning algorithm that
performs background subtraction of interloping field galaxies along the cluster
line-of-sight and a conventional luminosity distribution fitting approach that
estimates cluster richness based only on the number of galaxies within a
magnitude range and search area. In this proof-of-concept study, we obtain a
balanced accuracy of $83.20$ per cent when distinguishing between cluster and
field galaxies as well as a median absolute percentage error of $33.50$ per
cent between our estimated cluster richnesses and known cluster richnesses
within $r_{200}$. In the future, we aim for AutoEnRichness to be applied on
upcoming large-scale optical surveys, such as the Legacy Survey of Space and

galaxy groups and clusters from across the halo mass function. This would

demonstrates that optimizing rounding schemes can improve model accuracy. By
replacing the constant border with a simple border function, we can obtain the
minimal error for multiplying two numbers and eliminate the bias of its

we approximate the border function to make the incurred overhead negligible. We
also jointly optimize propagated errors and global errors. We finally propose
our AQuant framework, which can learn the border function automatically.
Extensive experiments show that AQuant achieves noticeable improvements

characterized by a high global luminosity at 144 MHz ($6-27\times10^{22}$ W
Hz$^{-1}$), in excess compared to their ongoing star formation rate. The
comparison of radio and H$\alpha$ images smoothed with a Gaussian beam
corresponding to $\sim$10 kpc reveals a sub-linear spatial correlation between
the two emissions with an average slope $k=0.50$. In their stellar disk we
measure $k=0.77$, which is close to the radio-to-star formation linear
relation. We speculate that, as a consequence of the ram pressure, in these
jellyfish galaxies the cosmic rays transport is more efficient than in normal
galaxies. Radio tails typically have higher radio-to-H$\alpha$ ratios than the
disks, thus we suggest that the radio emission is boosted by the electrons
stripped from the disks. In all galaxies, the star formation rate has decreased
by a factor $\leq10$ within the last $\sim10^8$ yr. The observed radio emission
is consistent with the past star formation, so we propose that this recent
decline may be the cause of their radio luminosity-to-star formation rate
excess.

previous researches on the fusion of IMU and vision data, which is

this work we propose a framework called \emph{FusePose} under a parametric

NaiveFuse, KineFuse and AdaDeepFuse. NaiveFuse servers as a basic approach that
only fuses simplified IMU data and estimated 3D pose in euclidean space. While
in kinematic space, KineFuse is able to integrate the calibrated and aligned
IMU raw data with converted 3D pose parameters. AdaDeepFuse further develops
this kinematical fusion process to an adaptive and end-to-end trainable manner.
Comprehensive experiments with ablation studies demonstrate the rationality and
superiority of the proposed framework. The performance of 3D human pose
estimation is improved compared to the baseline result. On Total Capture

  Persons","28 pages, 10 figures, and 6 tables",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In multi-person 2D pose estimation, the bottom-up methods simultaneously
predict poses for all persons, and unlike the top-down methods, do not rely on
human detection. However, the SOTA bottom-up methods' accuracy is still
inferior compared to the existing top-down methods. This is due to the
predicted human poses being regressed based on the inconsistent human bounding
box center and the lack of human-scale normalization, leading to the predicted
human poses being inaccurate and small-scale persons being missed. To push the
envelope of the bottom-up pose estimation, we firstly propose multi-scale
training to enhance the network to handle scale variation with single-scale
testing, particularly for small-scale persons. Secondly, we introduce dual
anatomical centers (i.e., head and body), where we can predict the human poses
more accurately and reliably, especially for small-scale persons. Moreover,
existing bottom-up methods use multi-scale testing to boost the accuracy of
pose estimation at the price of multiple additional forward passes, which
weakens the efficiency of bottom-up methods, the core strength compared to
top-down methods. By contrast, our multi-scale training enables the model to
predict high-quality poses in a single forward pass (i.e., single-scale
testing). Our method achieves 38.4\% improvement on bounding box precision and
39.1\% improvement on bounding box recall over the state of the art (SOTA) on
the challenging small-scale persons subset of COCO. For the human pose AP
evaluation, we achieve a new SOTA (71.0 AP) on the COCO test-dev set with the
single-scale testing. We also achieve the top performance (40.3 AP) on OCHuman

models based on matrix factorization, for instance principal component analysis
and topic models. Quantifying the uncertainty of such a decomposition based on
a finite sample estimate is essential to reasoning under uncertainty when
employing such models. This paper tackles the challenge of computing confidence
bounds on the individual entries of eigenvectors of a covariance matrix of
fixed dimension. Moreover, we derive a method to bound the entries of the
inverse covariance matrix, the so-called precision matrix. The assumptions
behind our method are minimal and require that the covariance matrix exists,
and its empirical estimator converges to the true covariance. We make use of
the theory of U-statistics to bound the $L_2$ perturbation of the empirical
covariance matrix. From this result, we obtain bounds on the eigenvectors using
Weyl's theorem and the eigenvalue-eigenvector identity and we derive confidence
intervals on the entries of the precision matrix using matrix inversion
perturbation bounds. As an application of these results, we demonstrate a new
statistical test, which allows us to test for non-zero values of the precision
matrix. We compare this test to the well-known Fisher-z test for partial
correlations, and demonstrate the soundness and scalability of the proposed
statistical test, as well as its application to real-world data from medical

singularity, which is very different from the codimension-one brane. We analyze

is similar to the case of codimension-one brane and builds an excellent

and $\cos\theta_{K^*}$ distributions from the LHCb simultaneously; $\chi^2/{\rm

$\Xi_c\bar{D}$-$\Lambda_c\bar{D}_s$ coupled-channel scattering amplitude built

$4254.6\pm 0.5$ MeV. Without the coupled-channels, $P_{\psi s}^\Lambda(4338)$
is a $\Xi_c \bar{D}$ bound state while $P_{\psi s}^\Lambda(4255)$ is a
$\Lambda_c\bar{D}_s$ virtual state. The data disfavors a hypothesis of $P_{\psi

at incident energies ranging from 1 to 20 GeV per nucleon in the fixed target
frame, $E_{lab} \in [1, 20]$ AGeV, potentially allow for an accurate
determination of the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state at 2 -- 4
$n_0$. We simulate Au+Au collisions at these energies using a hadronic
transport model with an adjustable vector mean-field potential dependent on
baryon density $n_B$. The mean field is parametrized to reproduce a given
density-dependence of the speed of sound at zero temperature $c_s^2(n_B, T =
0)$, which is varied independently in multiple density intervals to probe the
differential sensitivity of heavy-ion observables to the EOS at these specific
densities. The sensitivity of flow, especially the slope of the directed flow,
to the EOS at $n_B \in (2,3)n_0$ and $n_B \in (3,4)n_0$ is shown to be high and
to peak around $E_{lab} \in[4,8]$ AGeV, which is within the range covered by
the E895 experiment and, more recently, by the Beam Energy Scan II at RHIC. In
agreement with previous works on this subject, we cannot describe the E895
data: the measurements of the slope of the directed flow are reproduced by a
softer equation of state, while describing the elliptic flow data requires a
harder equation of state. However, a newer set of proton flow data from the
STAR experiment (in disagreement with the older E895 data) is described well by
our model and leads to posterior values of $c_s^2[n_B \in (2,3)n_0] = 0.47\pm

equation of state at $n_B \in (2,3) n_0$ and a possible phase transition at
$n_B \in (3,4) n_0$. More data at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} \in [3, 5]$ GeV, as well as a
more thorough analysis of the model systematic uncertainties will be necessary

viral loads of each compartment. To this aim, we formally derive the
compartmental model from an appropriate microscopic one. Firstly, we consider a
multi-agent system in which individuals are identified by the epidemiological
compartment to which they belong and by their viral load. Microscopic rules
describe both the switch of compartment and the evolution of the viral load. In
particular, in the binary interactions between susceptible and infectious
individuals, the probability for the susceptible individual to get infected
depends on the viral load of the infectious individual. Then, we implement the
prescribed microscopic dynamics in appropriate kinetic equations, from which
the macroscopic equations for the densities and viral load momentum of the
compartments are eventually derived. In the macroscopic model, the rate of
disease transmission turns out to be a function of the mean viral load of the
infectious population. We analytically and numerically investigate the case
that the transmission rate linearly depends on the viral load, which is
compared to the classical case of constant transmission rate. A qualitative
analysis is performed based on stability and bifurcation theory. Finally,
numerical investigations concerning the model reproduction number and the

the rapid, easy, and convenient prototyping of ideas and the rapid
time-to-market of products are becoming important with advances in technology.
Conventionally, for the development stage, particularly when confirming the
feasibility or performance of a new system or service, an idea is first
confirmed through a computerbased software simulation after developing an
accurate model of the operating environment. Next, this idea is validated and
tested in the real operating environment. The new systems or services and their
operating environments are becoming increasingly complicated. Hence, their
development processes too are more complex cost- and time-intensive tasks that
require engineers with skill and professional knowledge/experience.
Furthermore, for ensuring fast time-to-market, all the development processes
encompassing the (i) algorithm development, (ii) product prototyping, and (iii)
final product development, must be closely linked such that they can be quickly
completed. In this context, the aim of this paper is to propose an ultrahigh
bandwidth software-defined radio platform that can prototype a quasi-real-time
operating system without a developer having sophisticated hardware/software
expertise. This platform allows the realization of a software-implemented
digital signal processing system in minimal time with minimal efforts and
without the need of a host computer.

from an imaginary vector potential, induces the non-hermitian skin-effect and
causes exponential localization for all single particle eigenfunctions in the
non-interacting limit. Nevertheless, the density profile of the interacting

Friedel oscillations exhibit a beating pattern due to the modification of the
Fermi wavenumber. The probability distribution of particles over any finite

vector potential and the variance is symmetric to the center of the chain. This
is confirmed by several numerically exact methods even for relatively small

Our calculations show that the topological phase is driven by the AFM order,

superconducting state. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy we
observe a low-energy edge mode, which separates the topological phase from the
trivial one, at the boundaries of antiferromagnetic islands. As predicted by
the calculations, we find that the relative spectral weight of the edge mode
depends on the edge's atomic configuration. Our results establish the

cumbersome pose or body part estimators to learn cloth-irrelevant features from

performance is significantly limited due to the resolution degradation of
surveillance images. To address the above limitations, we propose an effective
Identity-Sensitive Knowledge Propagation framework (DeSKPro) for CC-ReID.
Specifically, a Cloth-irrelevant Spatial Attention module is introduced to
eliminate the distraction of clothing appearance by acquiring knowledge from
the human parsing module. To mitigate the resolution degradation issue and mine
identity-sensitive cues from human faces, we propose to restore the missing
facial details using prior facial knowledge, which is then propagated to a
smaller network. After training, the extra computations for human parsing or
face restoration are no longer required. Extensive experiments show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Our code is

the most frequent handicaps is the selection of kernel bandwidths prior to

spatial and temporal bandwidths change at each data point in a spatio-temporal

although there have been studied in spatial settings, little has been said
about them in the spatio-temporal context. We define the adaptive intensity
estimator in the spatio-temporal context and extend a partitioning technique
based on the bandwidths quantiles to perform a fast estimation. We demonstrate
through simulation that this technique works well in practice with the

description of the 2-quandle of its Dehn quandle. Further, with some exceptions
for genus more than two, we determine all values of $n$ for which the
$n$-quandle of its Dehn quandle is finite. The result can be thought of as the
Dehn quandle analogue of a similar result of Hoste and Shanahan for link

a set of measured signals. SR retrieves higher-frequency signal content by
combining multiple lower resolution sampled data sets. SR is well known both in
the temporal and spatial domains. It is widely used in imaging to reduce
aliasing and enhance the resolution of coarsely sampled images.This paper
applies the SR technique to the bi-dimensional wavefront reconstruction. In
particular, we show how SR is intrinsically suited for tomographic multi
WaveFront Sensor (WFS) AO systems revealing many of its advantages with minimal
design effort. This paper provides a direct space and Fourier-optics
description of the wavefront sensing operation and demonstrate how SR can be
exploited through signal reconstruction, especially in the framework of
Periodic Nonuniform Sampling. Both meta uniform and nonuniform sampling schemes
are investigated. Then, the SR bi-dimensional model for a Shack Hartmann (SH)
WFS is provided and the characteristics of the sensitivity function are
analyzed. The SR concept is finally validated with numerical simulations of
representative multi WFS SH AO systems. Our results show that combining several
WFS samples in a SR framework grants access to a larger number of modes than
the native one offered by a single WFS and that despite the fixed sub-aperture
size across samples. Furthermore, we show that the associated noise propagation
is not degraded under SR. Finally, the concept is extended to the signal
produced by single Pyramid WFS. In conclusion, SR applied to wavefront
reconstruction offers a new parameter space to explore as it decouples the size
of the subaperture from the desired wavefront sampling resolution. By cutting
short with old assumptions, new, more flexible and better performing AO designs
become now possible.

  https://github.com/HaozheLiu-ST/MEE",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown compelling results in
various tasks and applications in recent years. However, mode collapse remains
a critical problem in GANs. In this paper, we propose a novel training pipeline
to address the mode collapse issue of GANs. Different from existing methods, we
propose to generalize the discriminator as feature embedding and maximize the
entropy of distributions in the embedding space learned by the discriminator.
Specifically, two regularization terms, i.e., Deep Local Linear Embedding
(DLLE) and Deep Isometric feature Mapping (DIsoMap), are designed to encourage
the discriminator to learn the structural information embedded in the data,
such that the embedding space learned by the discriminator can be well-formed.
Based on the well-learned embedding space supported by the discriminator, a
non-parametric entropy estimator is designed to efficiently maximize the
entropy of embedding vectors, playing as an approximation of maximizing the
entropy of the generated distribution. By improving the discriminator and
maximizing the distance of the most similar samples in the embedding space, our
pipeline effectively reduces the mode collapse without sacrificing the quality
of generated samples. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of
our method, which outperforms the GAN baseline, MaF-GAN on CelebA (9.13 vs.
12.43 in FID) and surpasses the recent state-of-the-art energy-based model on
the ANIME-FACE dataset (2.80 vs. 2.26 in Inception score). The code is

(CMB) represents the main scientific goal of most of the future CMB
experiments. Such signal is predicted to be much lower than the polarised
Galactic emission (foregrounds) in any region of the sky pointing to the need
for complex components separation methods, such as the Needlet-ILC (NILC). In
this work we explore the possibility of employing NILC for B-modes maps
reconstructed from partial-sky data of sub-orbital experiments, addressing the
complications that such an application yields: E-B leakage, needlet filtering
and beam convolution. We consider two complementary simulated datasets from
future experiments: the balloon-borne SWIPE telescope of the Large Scale
Polarization Explorer, which targets the observation of both reionisation and
recombination peaks of the primordial B-modes angular power spectrum, and the
ground-based Small Aperture Telescope of Simons Observatory, which is designed
to observe only the recombination bump. We assess the performance of two
alternative techniques for correcting the CMB E-B leakage: the recycling
technique (Liu et al. 2019) and the ZB method (Zhao & Baskaran 2010). We find
that they both reduce the E-B leakage residuals at a negligible level given the
sensitivity of the considered experiments, except for the recycling method on
the SWIPE patch at $\ell < 20$. Thus, we implement two extensions of the
pipeline, the iterative B-decomposition and the diffusive inpainting, which
permit to recover the input CMB B-modes power for $\ell \geq 5$. For the
considered experiments, we demonstrate that needlet filtering and beam
convolution do not affect the B-modes reconstruction. Finally, with an
appropriate masking strategy, we find that NILC foregrounds subtraction allows
to recover values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio compatible to the targets of
the considered CMB experiments.

an excellent diagnostic tool for studies of the dynamics of the Solar
chromosphere, albeit through a single receiver band at one time presently. Each
ALMA band consists of four sub-bands that are comprised of several spectral
channels. To date, however, the spectral domain has been neglected in favour of
ensuring optimal imaging, so that time-series observations have been mostly
limited to full-band data products, thereby limiting studies to a single
chromospheric layer. Here, we report the first observations of a dynamical
event (i.e. wave propagation) for which the ALMA Band 3 data (centred at 3\,mm;
100\,GHz) is split into a lower and an upper sideband. In principle, this
approach is aimed at mapping slightly different layers in the Solar atmosphere.
The side-band data were reduced together with the Solar ALMA Pipeline (SoAP),
resulting in time series of brightness-temperature maps for each side-band.
Through a phase analysis of a magnetically quiet region, where purely acoustic
waves are expected to dominate, the average height difference between the two
side-bands is estimated as $73\pm16$~km. Furthermore, we examined the
propagation of transverse waves in small-scale bright structures by means of
wavelet phase analysis between oscillations at the two atmospheric heights. We
find 6\% of the waves to be standing, while 54\% and 46\% of the remaining
waves are propagating upwards and downwards, respectively, with absolute
propagating speeds on the order of $\approx96$~km/s, resulting in a mean energy
flux of $3800$\,W/m$^2$.

of the simulation plane. The injected pair plasma expels the magnetic field and
piles it up at its front. It traps ambient electrons and drags them across the
protons. An electric field grows, which accelerates protons into the pair
cloud's expansion direction. This electromagnetic pulse separates the pair
cloud from the ambient plasma. Electrons and positrons, which drift in the
pulse's nonuniform field, trigger an instability that disrupts the current
sheet ahead of the pulse. The wave vector of the growing perturbation is
orthogonal to the magnetic field direction and magnetic tension cannot
stabilize it. The electromagnetic pulse becomes permeable for pair plasma,
which forms new electromagnetic pulses ahead of the initial one. A transition
layer develops with a thickness of a few proton skin depths, in which protons
and positrons are accelerated by strong electromagnetic fields. Protons form
dense clumps surrounded by a strong magnetic field. The thickness of the
transition layer grows less rapidly than we would expect from the typical
speeds of the pair plasma particles and the latter transfer momentum to
protons; hence, the transition layer acts as a discontinuity, separating the
pair plasma from the ambient plasma. Such a discontinuity is an important
building block for astrophysical pair plasma jets.

With cooling at ambient pressure, s(w) develops an energy gap of about 0.17 eV

dice consistency loss that enforces similarity between the overall head shape
of the source and rendered image, 2) a scale consistency loss to ensure that
head shape is accurately reproduced even if the upper part of the head is not
visible, and 3) a 71 landmark detector trained using a moving average loss

for machine learning tasks such as text processing, annotation and translation.
The project also undertook proof of concept systems in speech to text and

to compute the invariant for a smooth family of 4-manifolds by cutting it open
along a product family of 3-manifolds and studying the induced maps on monopole
Floer (co)homology. When the cutting 3-manifold is an L-space, this formula
implies a relation between the family Seiberg-Witten invariant, the
Seiberg-Witten invariant of the fiber and the index of the family Dirac
operator. We use this relation to calculate the Seiberg-Witten invariant of
families of 4-manifolds that arise when resolving an ADE singularity using a
hyperk\""ahler family of complex structures near the singularity. Several
applications are obtained. First, we establish a large family of
simply-connected 4-manifolds $M$ (e.g. all elliptic surfaces) such that
$\pi_{1}(\textrm{Diff}(M))$ has a $\mathbb{Z}^{\infty}$-summand . For such $M$,
the product $S^{2}\times M$ smoothly fibers over $S^{2}$ with fiber $M$ in
infinitely many distinct ways. Second, we show that on any closed symplectic
4-manifold that contains a smoothly embedded sphere of self-intersection $-1$
or $-2$, there is a loop of diffeomorphisms that is not homotopic to a loop of
symplectormorphisms. This generalizes a previous result by Smirnov and confirms
a conjecture by McDuff in dimension 4. It also provides many new examples of
4-manifolds whose space of symplectic forms has a nontrivial fundamental group

accurate predictions on average, they may still allow for wrong predictions

probabilities that correspond to true frequencies -- can be as important as
having predictions that are simply accurate on average. However, uncertainty
estimates can be unreliable for certain inputs. In this paper, we develop a new
approach to selective classification in which we propose a method for rejecting
examples with ""uncertain"" uncertainties. By doing so, we aim to make
predictions with {well-calibrated} uncertainty estimates over the distribution

of an inhomogeneous frequency distribution, this simple picture breaks down and
new and surprising features appear. Here we leverage the high degree of control

Geminid-associated asteroids: (3200)Phaethon, 2005 UD and 1999 YC using
WISE/NEOWISE. The images were taken at the four wavelength bands
3.4$\mu$m(W1),4.6$\mu$m(W2),12$\mu$m(W3),and 22$\mu$m(W4). We find no evidence
of lasting mass-loss in the asteroids over the decadal multi-epoch datasets. We
set an upper limit to the mass-loss rate in dust of Q<2kg s$^{-1}$ for Phaethon
and <0.1kg s$^{-1}$ for both 2005 UD and 1999 YC, respectively, with little
dependency over the observed heliocentric distances of R=1.0$-$2.3au. For
Phaethon, even if the maximum mass-loss was sustained over the 1000(s)yr
dynamical age of the Geminid stream, it is more than two orders of magnitude
too small to supply the reported stream mass (1e13$-$14kg). The
Phaethon-associated dust trail (Geminid stream) is not detected at R=2.3au,
corresponding an upper limit on the optical depth of $\tau$<7e-9. Additionally,
no co-moving asteroids with radii r<650m were found. The DESTINY+ dust analyzer
would be capable of detecting several of the 10$\mu$m-sized interplanetary dust
particles when at far distances(>50,000km) from Phaethon. From 2005 UD, if the
mass-loss rate lasted over the 10,000yr dynamical age of the Daytime Sextantid
meteoroid stream, the mass of the stream would be ~1e10kg. The 1999 YC images
showed neither the related dust trail ($\tau$<2e-8) nor co-moving objects with
radii r<170m at R=1.6au. Estimated physical parameters from these limits do not
explain the production mechanism of the Geminid meteoroid stream. Lastly, to
explore the origin of the Geminids, we discuss the implications for our data in
relation to the possibly sodium (Na)-driven perihelion activity of Phaethon.

the perturbation eigenmode. This multimode analysis refines the accuracy of the

are global and start from the collapse phase of the parent cloud core, while
the dead zone is calculated via an adaptive $\alpha$ formulation by taking into
account the local ionization balance. The evolution of the dusty component
includes its growth and back reaction on to the gas. Previously, using
simulations with only a gas component, we showed that dynamical rings form at
the inner edge of the dead zone. We find that when dust evolution as well as
magnetic field evolution in the flux-freezing limit are included, the dusty
rings formed are more numerous and span a larger radial extent in the inner
disc, while the dead zone is more robust and persists for a much longer time.
We show that these dynamical rings concentrate enough dust mass to become
streaming unstable, which should result in rapid planetesimal formation even in
the embedded phases of the system. The episodic outbursts caused by the
magnetorotational instability have significant impact on the evolution of the
rings. The outbursts drain the inner disc of grown dust, however, the period
between bursts is sufficiently long for the planetesimal growth via streaming
instability.The dust mass contained within the rings is large enough to
ultimately produce planetary systems with the core accretion scenario. The low
mass systems rarely undergo outbursts and thus, the conditions around such
stars can be especially conducive for planet formation.

in a data sample of lead-lead collisions recorded in 2018 by the CMS experiment
at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}} =$
5.02 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
$1.7\pm0.1\,\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$. Top quark pair ($\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$) production
is measured in events with two opposite-sign high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ isolated
leptons ($\ell^\pm\ell^\mp =\,\mathrm{e}^{+} \mathrm{e}^{-},\,\mu^{+}
\mu^{-},\,\mathrm{and}\,\mathrm{e}^{\pm} \mu^{\mp}$). We test the sensitivity
to the $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ signal process by requiring or not the additional
presence of b-tagged jets, and hence demonstrate the feasibility to identify
top quark decay products irrespective of interacting with the medium (bottom
quarks) or not (leptonically decaying W bosons). To that end, the inclusive
cross section ($\sigma_\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$) is derived from likelihood fits to a
multivariate discriminator, which includes different leptonic kinematic
variables with and without the b-tagged jet multiplicity information. The
observed (expected) significance of the $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ signal against the
background-only hypothesis is 4.0 (5.8) and 3.8 (4.8) standard deviations,
respectively, for the fits with and without the b-jet multiplicity input. After
event reconstruction and background subtraction, the extracted cross sections
are $\sigma_\mathrm{t\bar{t}} = 2.03 ^{+0.71}_{-0.64}$ and $2.54
^{+0.84}_{-0.74}\,\mu\mathrm{b}$, respectively, which are lower than, but still
compatible with, the expectations from scaled proton-proton data as well as
from perturbative quantum chromodynamics predictions. This measurement
constitutes the first crucial step towards using the top quark as a novel tool
for probing strongly interacting matter.

pairwise intersecting pseudocircles. The focus will be on two problems from
Gr\""unbaum's monograph from the 1970's.
  First, we discuss the maximum number of digons or touching points. Gr\""unbaum
conjectured that there are at most $2n-2$ digon cells or equivalently at most
$2n-2$ touchings. Agarwal et al. (2004) verified the conjecture for cylindrical
arrangements. We show that the conjecture holds for any arrangement which
contains three pseudocircles that pairwise form a touching. The proof makes use
of the result for cylindrical arrangements. Moreover, we construct
non-cylindrical arrangements which attain the maximum of $2n-2$ touchings and
have no triple of pairwise touching pseudocircles.
  Second, we discuss the minimum number of triangular cells (triangles) in
arrangements without digons and touchings. Felsner and Scheucher (2017) showed
that there exist arrangements with only $\lceil \frac{16}{11}n \rceil$
triangles, which disproved a conjecture of Gr\""unbaum. Here we provide a
construction with only $\lceil \frac{4}{3}n \rceil$ triangles. A corresponding
lower bound was obtained by Snoeyink and Hershberger (1991).

long-term observations of visual or spectroscopic binary star systems. While
advances in high-resolution imaging have enabled observations of systems with
shorter orbital periods, stellar mass measurements remain challenging, and
relatively few have been precisely measured. We present a new statistical
approach to measuring masses for populations of stars. Using Gaia astrometry,
we analyze the relative orbital motion of $>3,800$ wide binary systems
comprising low-mass stars to establish a Mass-Magnitude relation in the Gaia
$G_\mathrm{RP}$ band spanning the absolute magnitude range
$14.5>M_{G_\mathrm{RP}}>4.0$, corresponding to a mass range of
$0.08$~M$_{\odot}\lesssim M\lesssim1.0$~M$_{\odot}$. This relation is directly
applicable to $>30$ million stars in the Gaia catalog. Based on comparison to
existing Mass-Magnitude relations calibrated for 2MASS $K_{s}$ magnitudes, we
estimate that the internal precision of our mass estimates is $\sim$10$\%$. We
use this relation to estimate masses for a volume-limited sample of
$\sim$18,200 stars within 50~pc of the Sun and the present-day field mass
function for stars with $M\lesssim 1.0$~M$_{\odot}$, which we find peaks at
0.16~M$_{\odot}$. We investigate a volume-limited sample of wide binary systems
with early K dwarf primaries, complete for binary mass ratios $q>0.2$, and
measure the distribution of $q$ at separations $>100$~au. We find that our
distribution of $q$ is not uniformly distributed, rather decreasing towards

  Method",,,,,"cs.LG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hyperparameter optimization in machine learning is often achieved using naive
techniques that only lead to an approximate set of hyperparameters. Although
techniques such as Bayesian optimization perform an intelligent search on a
given domain of hyperparameters, it does not guarantee an optimal solution. A
major drawback of most of these approaches is an exponential increase of their
search domain with number of hyperparameters, increasing the computational cost
and making the approaches slow. The hyperparameter optimization problem is
inherently a bilevel optimization task, and some studies have attempted bilevel
solution methodologies for solving this problem. However, these studies assume
a unique set of model weights that minimize the training loss, which is
generally violated by deep learning architectures. This paper discusses a
gradient-based bilevel method addressing these drawbacks for solving the
hyperparameter optimization problem. The proposed method can handle continuous
hyperparameters for which we have chosen the regularization hyperparameter in
our experiments. The method guarantees convergence to the set of optimal
hyperparameters that this study has theoretically proven. The idea is based on
approximating the lower-level optimal value function using Gaussian process
regression. As a result, the bilevel problem is reduced to a single level
constrained optimization task that is solved using the augmented Lagrangian
method. We have performed an extensive computational study on the MNIST and
CIFAR-10 datasets on multi-layer perceptron and LeNet architectures that
confirms the efficiency of the proposed method. A comparative study against
grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and HyberBand method on
various hyperparameter problems shows that the proposed algorithm converges
with lower computation and leads to models that generalize better on the
testing set.

difficulty of pandemic control continues to increase, which has brought
significant costs to the society. The existing pandemic control zoning method
ignores the impact on residents'lives. In this study, we propose a refined and
low-cost pandemic control method by scientifically delineating zoning areas.
First, a spatial interaction network is built up based on the multimodal
transport travel data in Nanjing, China, and an improved Leiden community
detection method based on the gravity model is used to obtain a preliminary
zoning scheme. Then, we use spatial constraints to correct the results with the
discrete spatial distribution. Finally, reasonable zones for pandemic control
are obtained. The modularity of the algorithm results is 0.4185, proving that
the proposed method is suitable for pandemic control zoning. The proposed
method is also demonstrated to be able to minimize traffic flows between
pandemic control areas and only 24.8% of travel connections are cut off, thus
reducing the impact of pandemic control on residents'daily life and reducing
the cost of pandemic control. The findings can help to inform sustainable
strategies and suggestions for the pandemic control.

matching algorithms, which is a standard scheme for load-balancing. We prove
that major random matching algorithms achieve nearly optimal load balance in
$O(r \log (\Delta n))$ steps on edge-Markovian evolving graphs, where $r =
\max\{p/(1-q), (1-q)/p\}$, $n$ is the number of vertices (i.e., processors) and
$\Delta$ denotes the initial gap of loads unbalance. We remark that the
independent sequences of random graphs correspond to $r=1$. To avoid the
difficulty of an analysis caused by a complex correlation with the history of
an execution, we develop a simple proof technique based on history-independent
bounds. As far as we know, this is the first theoretical analysis of
load-balancing on randomly evolving graphs, not only for the edge-Markovian but
also for the independent sequences of random graphs.

dots are considered among the most promising technologies for building scalable
quantum computers. However, to realize quantum-dot-based high-fidelity quantum
processing units several challenges need to be solved. In this respect,
improving the charge noise environment of silicon quantum dot-based qubits and
the development of ultra-low-power on-chip cryogenic classical complementary
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics for the manipulation and
interfacing of the qubits are important milestones. We report scalable
interfacing of highly tunable and ultra-low charge noise electron and hole
quantum dots embedded in a 64-channel cryogenic CMOS multiplexer, which has
less-than-detectable static power dissipation (< 1 pW) even at sub-1 K
temperatures. Our integrated hybrid quantum-dot CMOS technology provides a
route to scalable interfacing of up to millions of high-quality quantum dots
enabling, for example, straightforward variability analysis and qubit geometry
optimization, which are essential prerequisites for building fault-tolerant
large-scale silicon-based quantum computers. At 5.6 K temperature, we find
unprecedentedly low charge noise of 22 and 28 $\mu$eV/$\sqrt {Hz}$ at 1 Hz in
the electrostatically defined few-electron and few-hole quantum dots,
respectively. The low-noise quantum dots are realized by harnessing a custom
CMOS process that utilizes a conventional doped-Poly-Si/SiO$_2$/Si MOS stack.
This approach provides lower charge noise background than high-k metal gate
solutions and translates into higher spin qubit fidelities.

Different fragmentation channels involving the dissociative ionization (DI) and
dissociative electron attachment (DEA) mechanisms are considered. The conducted
simulations of FEBID confirm experimental observations that deposits consist of
small gold clusters embedded into a carbon-rich organic matrix. The simulation
results indicate that accounting for both DEA- and DI-induced fragmentation of
all the covalent bonds in Me$_2$Au(tfac) and increasing the amount of energy
transferred to the system upon fragmentation increase the concentration of gold
in the deposit. The simulations predict an increase in Au:C ratio in the

product and ensure that the product meets its expected requirements. Some
software testing approached are lacking automation or are partly automated
which increases the testing time and overall software testing costs. Recently,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been successfully employed in complex testing
tasks such as game testing, regression testing, and test case prioritization to
automate the process and provide continuous adaptation. Practitioners can
employ RL by implementing from scratch an RL algorithm or use an RL framework.
Developers have widely used these frameworks to solve problems in various
domains including software testing. However, to the best of our knowledge,
there is no study that empirically evaluates the effectiveness and performance
of pre-implemented algorithms in RL frameworks. In this paper, we empirically
investigate the applications of carefully selected RL algorithms on two
important software testing tasks: test case prioritization in the context of
Continuous Integration (CI) and game testing. For the game testing task, we
conduct experiments on a simple game and use RL algorithms to explore the game
to detect bugs. Results show that some of the selected RL frameworks such as
Tensorforce outperform recent approaches in the literature. To prioritize test
cases, we run experiments on a CI environment where RL algorithms from
different frameworks are used to rank the test cases. Our results show that the
performance difference between pre-implemented algorithms in some cases is
considerable, motivating further investigation. Moreover, empirical evaluations
on some benchmark problems are recommended for researchers looking to select RL
frameworks, to make sure that RL algorithms perform as intended.

equivalent ways. Even though previous research has compared specific formatting
elements to find out which alternatives affect code legibility, seeing the
bigger picture of what makes code more or less legible is challenging. Goal: We
aim to find which formatting elements have been investigated in empirical
studies and which alternatives were found to be more legible for human
subjects. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review and identified 15
papers containing human-centric studies that directly compared alternative
formatting elements. We analyzed and organized these formatting elements using
a card-sorting method. Results: We identified 13 formatting elements (e.g.,
indentation) and 33 levels of formatting elements (e.g., two-space
indentation), which are about formatting styles, spacing, block delimiters,
long or complex code lines, and word boundary styles. While some levels were
found to be statistically better than other equivalent ones in terms of code
legibility, e.g., appropriate use of indentation with blocks, others were not,
e.g., formatting layout. For identifier style, we found divergent results,
where one study found a significant difference in favor of camel case, while
another study found a positive result in favor of snake case. Conclusion: The
number of identified papers, some of which are outdated, and the many null and
contradictory results emphasize the relative lack of work in this area and
underline the importance of more research. There is much to be understood about
how formatting elements influence code legibility before the creation of
guidelines and automated aids to help developers make their code more legible.

distance for probability measures so that the space of Radon measures equipped
with WFR can be viewed as metric cone over the space of probability measures
with spherical WFR. Compared to the case for Wasserstein distance, the
understanding of geodesics under the spherical WFR is less clear and still an
ongoing research focus. In this paper, we develop a deep learning framework to
compute the geodesics under the spherical WFR metric, and the learned geodesics
can be adopted to generate weighted samples. Our approach is based on a
Benamou-Brenier type dynamic formulation for spherical WFR. To overcome the
difficulty in enforcing the boundary constraint brought by the weight change, a
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term based on the inverse map is introduced
into the cost function. Moreover, a new regularization term using the particle
velocity is introduced as a substitute for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the
potential in dynamic formula. When used for sample generation, our framework
can be beneficial for applications with given weighted samples, especially in
the Bayesian inference, compared to sample generation with previous flow

nanotechnology with many of them being used for metrological purposes either to
calibrate instruments, or forming the basis of measuring devices such as
encoders. Evaluating the period of one or two-dimensional periodic structures
from topography measurements, e.g. performed using scanning probe microscopy
(SPM) methods, can be achieved using different methodologies with many grating
evaluation methods having been proposed in the past and applied to a handful of
examples. The optimum methodology for determining the grating pitch is not
immediately obvious. This paper reports the results of extensive large-scale
simulations and analysis to evaluate the performance of both direct and Fourier
space data processing methods. Many thousands of simulations have been
performed on a variety of different gratings under different measurement
conditions and including the simulation of defects encountered in real life
situations. The paper concludes with a summary of the merits and disadvantages
of the methods together with practical recommendations for the measurements of
periodic structures and for developing algorithms for processing them.

classification with anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT)

devices/conditions, which results in a vast change of underlying data
distributions (called ""data domains""). Moreover, due to practical labeling
difficulties, some domains (e.g., devices) may not have any data labels. As a
result, deep models trained on one specific domain (e.g., a specific device)

other devices). To address this issue, we present a multi-target domain
adaptation paradigm to transfer a model trained on one labeled source domain to
multiple unlabeled target domains. Specifically, we propose a novel Multi-scale
Multi-target Domain Adversarial Network (M2DAN) for angle closure
classification. M2DAN conducts multi-domain adversarial learning for extracting
domain-invariant features and develops a multi-scale module for capturing local
and global information of AS-OCT images. Based on these domain-invariant
features at different scales, the deep model trained on the source domain is
able to classify angle closure on multiple target domains even without any
annotations in these domains. Extensive experiments on a real-world AS-OCT

  phase transition",,,,,"quant-ph physics.chem-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Classical phase transitions, like solid-liquid-gas or order-disorder spin
magnetic phases, are all driven by thermal energy fluctuations by varying the
temperature. On the other hand, quantum phase transitions happen at absolute
zero temperature with quantum fluctuations causing the ground state energy to
show abrupt changes as one varies the system parameters like electron density,
pressure, disorder, or external magnetic field. Phase transitions happen at
critical values of the controlling parameters, such as the critical temperature
in classical phase transitions, and system critical parameters in the quantum
case. However, true criticality happens only at the thermodynamic limit, when
the number of particles goes to infinity with constant density. To perform the
calculations for the critical parameters, finite size scaling approach was
developed to extrapolate information from a finite system to the thermodynamic
limit. With the advancement in the experimental and theoretical work in the
field of ultra-cold systems, particularly trapping and controlling single
atomic and molecular systems, one can ask: do finite systems exhibit quantum
phase transition? To address this question, finite size scaling for finite
system was developed to calculate the quantum critical parameters. Recent
observation of a quantum phase transition in a single trapped 171 Yb ion in the
Paul trap indicates the possibility of quantum phase transition in finite
systems. This perspective focuses on examining chemical processes at ultracold
temperature as quantum phase transitions, particularly the formation and
dissociation of chemical bonds, which is the basic process for understanding
the whole of chemistry

``externally parameterized'' statistical games, and use them to construct two
approximate inference doctrines found in the computational neuroscience

""FedPrompt"" to study prompt tuning in a model split aggregation way using FL,
and prove that split aggregation greatly reduces the communication cost, only
0.01% of the PLMs' parameters, with little decrease on accuracy both on IID and
Non-IID data distribution. This improves the efficiency of FL method while also
protecting the data privacy in prompt tuning. In addition, like PLMs, prompts
are uploaded and downloaded between public platforms and personal users, so we
try to figure out whether there is still a backdoor threat using only soft
prompts in FL scenarios. We further conduct backdoor attacks by data poisoning
on FedPrompt. Our experiments show that normal backdoor attack can not achieve
a high attack success rate, proving the robustness of FedPrompt. We hope this

applications. Practical on-device videos are always untrimmed with both action
and background. It is desirable for a model to both recognize the class of
action and localize the temporal position where the action happens. Such a task
is called temporal action location (TAL), which is always trained on the cloud
where multiple untrimmed videos are collected and labeled. It is desirable for
a TAL model to continuously and locally learn from new data, which can directly
improve the action detection precision while protecting customers' privacy.
However, it is non-trivial to train a TAL model, since tremendous video samples
with temporal annotations are required. However, annotating videos frame by
frame is exorbitantly time-consuming and expensive. Although weakly-supervised
TAL (W-TAL) has been proposed to learn from untrimmed videos with only
video-level labels, such an approach is also not suitable for on-device
learning scenarios. In practical on-device learning applications, data are
collected in streaming. Dividing such a long video stream into multiple video
segments requires lots of human effort, which hinders the exploration of
applying the TAL tasks to realistic on-device learning applications. To enable
W-TAL models to learn from a long, untrimmed streaming video, we propose an
efficient video learning approach that can directly adapt to new environments.
We first propose a self-adaptive video dividing approach with a contrast
score-based segment merging approach to convert the video stream into multiple
segments. Then, we explore different sampling strategies on the TAL tasks to
request as few labels as possible. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first attempt to directly learn from the on-device, long video stream.

and interesting environments, a large amount of content is needed. As a
consequence, often several thousands of detailed 3D assets are used to create a
single scene. As each asset's polygon mesh can contain millions of polygons,
the number of polygons that need to be drawn every frame may exceed several
billions. Therefore, the computational resources often limit how many detailed
objects that can be displayed in a scene. To push this limit and to optimize
performance one can reduce the polygon count of the assets when possible.
Basically, the idea is that an object at farther distance from the capturing
camera, consequently with relatively smaller screen size, its polygon count may
be reduced without affecting the perceived quality. Level of Detail (LOD)
refers to the complexity level of a 3D model representation. The process of
removing complexity is often called LOD reduction and can be done automatically
with an algorithm or by hand by artists. However, this process may lead to
deterioration of the visual quality if the different LODs differ significantly,
or if LOD reduction transition is not seamless. Today the validation of these
results is mainly done manually requiring an expert to visually inspect the
results. However, this process is slow, mundane, and therefore prone to error.
Herein we propose a method to automate this process based on the use of deep
convolutional networks. We report promising results and envision that this

representations, and explore the pairwise correlations across views. But
unfortunately, a quadratic or even cubic complexity is often needed, bringing
about difficulty in clustering largescale datasets. Some efforts have been made
recently to capture data distribution in multiple views by selecting view-wise
anchor representations with k-means, or by direct matrix factorization on the
original observations. Despite the significant success, few of them have
considered the view-insufficiency issue, implicitly holding the assumption that
each individual view is sufficient to recover the cluster structure. Moreover,
the latent integral space as well as the shared cluster structure from multiple
insufficient views is not able to be simultaneously discovered. In view of
this, we propose an Adaptively-weighted Integral Space for Fast Multiview
Clustering (AIMC) with nearly linear complexity. Specifically, view generation
models are designed to reconstruct the view observations from the latent
integral space with diverse adaptive contributions. Meanwhile, a centroid
representation with orthogonality constraint and cluster partition are
seamlessly constructed to approximate the latent integral space. An alternate
minimizing algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem, which is
proved to have linear time complexity w.r.t. the sample size. Extensive
experiments conducted on several realworld datasets confirm the superiority of
the proposed AIMC method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

fixed and actuated traffic signals when a probability distribution is provided.
These distributions represent the domain of possible switching times from the
Signal Phasing and Timing (SPaT) messages. The system finds the least-cost
vehicle trajectory using a computationally efficient A-star algorithm
incorporated in a dynamic programming procedure to minimize the vehicle's total
fuel consumption. Constraints are introduced to ensure that vehicles do not,
collide with other vehicles, run red lights, or exceed a maximum vehicular jerk
for passenger comfort. Results of simulation scenarios are evaluated against
comparable trajectories of uninformed drivers to compute fuel consumption
savings. The proposed approach produced significant fuel savings compared to
the uninformed driver amounting to 37 percent on average for deterministic SPAT
and 28 percent for stochastic SPaT. A sensitivity analysis is performed to
understand how the degree of uncertainty in SPaT predictions affects the
optimal trajectory's fuel consumption. The results present the required levels
of confidence in these predictions to achieve most of the possible savings in
fuel consumption. Specifically, the proposed system can be within 85 percent of
the maximum savings if the timing error is (within 3.3 seconds) at a 95 percent
confidence level. They also emphasize the importance of more reliable SPaT
predictions the closer the time to green is relative to the time the vehicle is
expected to reach the intersection given its current speed.

simulation technique that extends the dynamics of granular materials known as
Discrete Element Method (DEM) by additional properties such as the
thermodynamic state, stress/strain for each particle. Such DEM simulations used
by industries to set up their experimental processes are complexes and heavy in
computation time.
  At each time step, those simulations generate a list of interacting particles
and this phase is one of the most computationally expensive parts of a DEM
simulation. The Verlet buffer method, initially introduced in Molecular Dynamic
(MD) (and also used in DEM), allows keeping the interaction list for many time
steps by extending each particle neighbourhood by a certain extension range,
and thus broadening the interaction list. The method relies on the temporal
coherency of DEM, which guarantees that no particles move erratically from one
time step to the next. In the classical approach, all the particles have their
neighbourhood extended by the same value which leads to suboptimal performances
in simulations where different flow regimes coexist. Additionally, and unlike
in MD, there is no comprehensive study analysing the different parameters that
affect the performance of the Verlet buffer method in DEM.
  In this work, we propose a new method for the dynamic update of the neighbour
list that depends on the particles individual displacement and define a
particle-specific extension range based on the local flow regime. The
interaction list is analysed throughout the simulation based on the particle's
displacement allowing a flexible update according to the flow regime
conditions. We evaluate the influence of the Verlet extension range on the
execution time through different test cases and analyse empirically the
extension range value giving the best performance.

constraints on the mass and the radius of the pulsar \textit{Her X-1} to
determine the model parameters confirming the physical viability of the model.
We found that the matter-geometry coupling in RT allows slightly less size than
GR for a given mass. We confirmed the model viability via other twenty pulsars'
observations. Utilizing the strong energy condition we determined an upper
bound on compactness $U_\text{max}\sim 0.603$, in agreement with the Buchdahl

compatible with a neutron core at nuclear saturation density, the mass-radius

measure to all nonempty open sets. For this, we make use of a well chosen
transfer operator acting on anisotropic Banach spaces, and construct the
measure by pairing its maximal eigenvectors. Last, we prove that the flow

Therefore, increasing the robustness of machine learning models in predicting
eye-tracking positions from EEG data is integral for both research and consumer
use. Previously, we compared the performance of classifiers trained solely on
finer-grain data to those trained solely on coarse-grain. Results indicated
that despite the overall improvement in robustness, the performance of the
fine-grain trained models decreased, compared to coarse-grain trained models,
when the testing and training set contained the same distributional patterns

using datasets of mixed data complexity to determine the ideal distribution of
fine- and coarse-grain data. We train machine learning models utilizing a mixed
dataset composed of both fine- and coarse-grain data and then compare the
accuracies to models trained using solely fine- or coarse-grain data. For our
purposes, finer-grain data refers to data collected using more complex methods
whereas coarser-grain data refers to data collected using more simple methods.
We apply covariate distributional shifts to test for the susceptibility of each
training set. Our results indicated that the optimal training dataset for
EEG-ET classification is not composed of solely fine- or coarse-grain data, but
rather a mix of the two, leaning towards finer-grain.

Notably, a double-peaked Intertropical Convergence Zone, a common problem in
ESMs, is removed. Enforcing a physical constraint to preserve global
precipitation sums, the GAN can generalize to future climate scenarios unseen
during training. Feature attribution shows that the GAN identifies regions
where the ESM exhibits strong biases. Our method constitutes a general
framework for correcting ESM variables and enables realistic simulations at a

the edges of the 2D TMDs show excellent electrocatalytic performance, their
basal plane is inert which hinders the industrial applications for
electrocatalysis. Here, we have computationally designed the 2D monolayer
MoSe$_2$ and studied its electronic properties with electrocatalytic
activities. Pt-atom has been doped in the pristine 2D MoSe$_2$ to activate the
inert basal plane resulting zero bandgap. This study reveals that the
Pt-MoSe$_2$ is an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the aid of
the DFT. Periodic hybrid DFT method has been applied to compute the electronic
properties of both the pristine MoSe$_2$ and Pt-MoSe$_2$. To determine both the
HER and ORR mechanisms on the surface of the Pt-MoSe2 material, a non-periodic
DFT calculation has been performed by considering a molecular
Pt1-Mo$_9$Se${21}$ cluster model. The present study shows that the 2D
Pt-MoSe$_2$ follows Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for HER with the energy barriers
about 9.29 kcal/mol and 10.55 kcal.mol-1 during the H-migration and Heyrovsky
reactions. The ORR is achieved by four-electron transfer mechanism with the
formation of two transition energy barriers about 14.94 kcal/mol and 11.10
kcal/mol, respectively. The lower energy barriers and high turnover frequency
during the reactions expose that the Pt-MoSe$_2$ can be adopted as an efficient
bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the HER and ORR. The present studies
demonstrate that the exceptional HER and ORR activity and stability performance
shown by the MoSe$_2$ electrocatalyst can be enhanced by Pt-doping, opening a
promising concept for the sensible design of high-performance catalyst for H2
production and O2 reduction.

  to accelerate osseointegration",,,,,"physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Regulating cell growth, extracellular matrix deposition and mineralization of
artificial implants are some important parameters that decide the longevity of
implants in the body. Picosecond laser induced hybrid groove structures have
been shown to improve these properties of the Ti6Al4V bio-alloy. Two hybrid
structures containing groove patterns with periodic and non-periodic
substructures therein were generated on Ti6Al4V by varying the extent of laser
pulse overlapping on sample surface. Laser induced alteration in surface
topography, chemical composition and wettability of Ti6Al4V resulted in 3-fold
increase in the rate of hydroxyapatite growth, 2.5-fold increment in protein
adsorption and 2-fold enhancement in cell adhesion in comparison to pristine
sample. While the periodic substructure was found to guide cell growth, the non
periodic sub structure offered homogenous growth leading to higher overall cell
density on the substrate surface.

the same formalism and deduce infinite products representations of $\pi$.
