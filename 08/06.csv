rely on neural networks for feature ranking are not robust since they can have
variations in their ranking when the model is initialized and trained with
different random seeds. In this work, we introduce a novel method based on
parameter averaging to estimate accurate and robust feature importance in
tabular data setting, referred as XTab. We first initialize and train multiple
instances of a shallow network (referred as local masks) with ""different random
seeds"" for a downstream task. We then obtain a global mask model by ""averaging
the parameters"" of local masks. We show that although the parameter averaging
might result in a global model with higher loss, it still leads to the
discovery of the ground-truth feature importance more consistently than an
individual model does. We conduct extensive experiments on a variety of
synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating that the XTab can be used to
obtain the global feature importance that is not sensitive to sub-optimal model
initialisation.

certain realistic conditions, specifically that photon quantum states are not
perfectly indistinguishable. The partial photon distinguishability presents a
serious limitation in implementation of optical quantum information processing.
In order to properly assess its effect on quantum information protocols,
accurate numerical simulations, which closely emulate quantum circuit
operations, are essential. Our specific objective is to provide a computer
implementation of the partial photon distinguishability which is in principle
applicable to existing simulation techniques used for ideal quantum circuits
and which avoids a need for their significant modification. Our approach is
based on the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process, which is well suited for
our purpose. Photonic quantum states are represented by wavepackets which
contain information on their time and frequency distributions. In order to
account for the partial photon distinguishability, we expand the number of
degrees of freedom associated with the circuit operation extending the
definition of the photon channels to incorporate wavepacket degrees of freedom.
This strategy allows to define delay operations in the same footing as the
linear optical elements.

Maximum Quasi-Clique Problem (MQCP). This problem has the planted Maximum
Clique Problem (MCP) as a special case. The maximum clique problem is NP-hard.
A Quasi-clique or $\gamma$-clique is a dense graph with the edge density of at
least $\gamma$, where $\gamma \in (0, 1]$. The maximum quasi-clique problem
seeks to find such a subgraph with the largest cardinality in a given graph.
Our method of choice is the low-rank plus sparse matrix splitting technique
that has been used successfully for similar problems in the literature. We
present a theoretical basis for when our convex relaxation problem recovers the
planted maximum quasi-clique. We derived a new bound on the norm of the dual
matrix that certifies the recovery using $l_{\infty,2} norm. We showed that
when certain conditions are met, our convex formulation recovers the planted
quasi-clique exactly. The numerical experiments we performed corroborated our
theory.

models that serve as statistical basis in educational and psychological
cognitive diagnosis assessments. CDMs aim to achieve fine-grained inference on
individuals' latent attributes, based on their observed responses to a set of
designed diagnostic items. In the literature, CDMs usually assume that items
require mastery of specific latent attributes and that each attribute is either
fully mastered or not mastered by a given subject. We propose a new class of
models, partial mastery CDMs (PM-CDMs), that generalizes CDMs by allowing for
partial mastery levels for each attribute of interest. We demonstrate that
PM-CDMs can be represented as restricted latent class models. Relying on the
latent class representation, we propose a Bayesian approach for estimation. We
present simulation studies to demonstrate parameter recovery, to investigate
the impact of model misspecification with respect to partial mastery, and to
develop diagnostic tools that could be used by practitioners to decide between
CDMs and PM-CDMs. We use two examples of real test data -- the fraction
subtraction and the English tests -- to demonstrate that employing PM-CDMs not
only improves model fit, compared to CDMs, but also can make substantial
difference in conclusions about attribute mastery. We conclude that PM-CDMs can
lead to more effective remediation programs by providing detailed
individual-level information about skills learned and skills that need to
study.

density estimator we proposed and a condition on the discretization step
$\Delta_n$ which plays the role of threshold between the intermediate regime
and the continuous case. In intermediate regime the convergence rate is $n^{-
\frac{2 \beta}{2 \beta + 1}}$, where $\beta$ is the smoothness of the invariant
density. After that, we complement the upper bounds previously found with a
lower bound over the set of all the possible estimator, which provides the same
convergence rate: it means it is not possible to propose a different estimator
which achieves better convergence rates. This is obtained by the two hypothesis
method; the most challenging part consists in bounding the Hellinger distance
between the laws of the two models. The key point is a Malliavin representation
for a score function, which allows us to bound the Hellinger distance through a

  interventions",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Improving the position of minorities in networks via interventions is a
challenge of high theoretical and societal importance. In this work, we examine
how different network growth interventions impact the position of minority
nodes in degree rankings over time. We distinguish between two kinds of
interventions: (i) group size interventions, such as introducing quotas, that
regulate the ratio of incoming minority and majority nodes; and (ii)
behavioural interventions, such as homophily, i.e. varying how groups interact
and connect to each other. We find that even extreme group size interventions
do not have a strong effect on the position of minorities in rankings if
certain behavioural changes do not manifest at the same time. For example,
minority representation in rankings is not increased by high quotas if the
actors in the network do not adopt homophilic behaviour. As a result, a key
finding of our research is that in order for the visibility of minorities to
improve, group size and behavioural interventions need to be coordinated.
Moreover, their potential benefit is highly dependent on pre-intervention
conditions in social networks. In a real-world case study, we explore the
effectiveness of interventions to reach gender parity in academia. Our work
lays a theoretical and computational foundation for further studies aiming to
explore the effectiveness of interventions in growing networks.

energy distribution (SED) fitting code \texttt{Prospector} with a flexible
star-formation history (SFH), a variable dust attenuation law, and a
self-consistent model of nebular emission (continuum and emission lines).
Importantly, we self-consistently fit both the emission line fluxes from JWST
NIRSpec and the broad-band photometry from JWST NIRCam, taking into account
slit-loss effects. We find that these three $z=7.6-8.5$ galaxies
($M_{\star}\approx10^{8}~M_{\odot}$) are young with rising SFHs and
mass-weighted ages of $3-4$ Myr, though we find indications for underlying
older stellar populations. The inferred gas-phase metallicities broadly agree
with the direct metallicity estimates from the auroral lines. The galaxy with
the lowest gas-phase metallicity ($\mathrm{Z}_{\rm

($<0.2~\mathrm{kpc}$) and has a high star-formation rate surface density
($\Sigma_{\rm

consistent with rapid gas accretion. The two other objects with higher
gas-phase metallicity show more complex multi-component morphologies on kpc
scales, indicating that their recent increase in star-formation rate is driven
by mergers or internal, gravitational instabilities. We discuss effects of
assuming different SFH priors or only fitting the photometric data. Our
analysis highlights the strength and importance of combining JWST imaging and
spectroscopy for fully assessing the nature of galaxies at the earliest epochs.

which affects the neutron star's measurable properties and makes compact
objects prime targets to search for ADM. In this work, we use Bayesian
inference to explore potential neutron star mass-radius measurements, from
current and future x-ray telescopes, to constrain the bosonic ADM parameters
for the case where bosonic ADM has accumulated in the neutron star interior. We
find that the current uncertainties in the baryonic equation of state do not
allow for constraints on the ADM parameter space to be made. However, we also
find that ADM cannot be excluded and the inclusion of bosonic ADM in neutron
star cores relaxes the constraints on the baryonic equation of state space. If
the baryonic equation of state were more tightly constrained independent of
ADM, we find that statements about the ADM parameter space could be made. In
particular, we find that the high bosonic ADM particle mass ($m_\chi$) and low
effective self-interaction strength ($g_\chi/m_\phi)$ regime is disfavored due
to the observationally and theoretically motivated constraint that neutron
stars must have at least a mass of $1 \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$. However, within the
remaining parameter space, $m_\chi$ and $g_\chi/m_\phi$ are individually
unconstrained. On the other hand, the ADM mass-fraction, i.e., the fraction of
ADM mass inside the neutron star, can be constrained by such neutron star
measurements.

subsystem problems by either gate-based quantum computers or quantum annealers,
optimizes the amplitude contributions of the solutions of the different
subsystems with the full-problem Hamiltonian by the variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE) on a gate-based quantum computer, and determines the
approximated ground-state configuration. We apply the level-1 approximation of
LSSA to solving fully-connected random Ising problems up to 160 variables using
a 5-qubit gate-based quantum computer, and solving portfolio optimization
problems up to 4096 variables using a 100-qubit quantum annealer and a 7-qubit

just a 5-qubit ($N_{\rm{gb}}$-qubit) gate-based quantum computer. The
completely new computational concept of the hybrid gate-based and annealing

large-size Ising problems and combinatorial optimization problems, making

layered nickelates, consisting of bands obtained from $d$ and $s$--like
orbitals, we investigate to which extend it can be mapped onto a single-band
Hubbard model. We identify screening of the more itinerant $s$-like band as an
important driver. In absence of screening one strongly-correlated band gives an
antiferromagnetic ground state. For weak screening, the strong correlations
push electrons out of the $s$-band so that the undoped nickelate remains a Mott
insulator with half filled $d$ orbitals. This regime markedly differs from the
observations in high-$T_c$ cuprates and pairing with $s$-wave symmetry would
rather be expected in the superconducting state. In contrast, for strong
screening, the $s$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ bands are both partly filled and couple
only weakly, so that one approximately finds a self-doped $d$ band as well as
tendencies towards $d$-wave pairing. Particularly in the regime of strong
screening mapping to a one-band model gives interesting spectral weight
transfers when a second $s$ band is also partly filled. We thus find that both
one-band physics and a Kondo-lattice--like regime emerge from the same
two-orbital model, depending on the strength of electronic correlations and the
size of the $s$-band pocket.

complex heterogeneity between agents and unchanging team structures. We outline

a collection of vertex-disjoint long paths seemingly escapes from the
literature. A path containing at least $k$ vertices is considered long. When $k

of vertices, the problem reduces to the Hamiltonian path problem, which is
NP-complete. For a fixed $k \ge 4$, the problem is NP-hard and the best known
approximation algorithm for the weighted set packing problem implies a
$k$-approximation algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, there is no
approximation algorithm directly designed for the general problem; when $k =
4$, the problem admits a $4$-approximation algorithm which was presented
recently. We propose the first $(0.4394 k + O(1))$-approximation algorithm for
the general problem and an improved $2$-approximation algorithm when $k = 4$.
Both algorithms are based on local improvement, and their theoretical
performance analyses are done via amortization and their practical performance

illustrate the clustering, a two species asymmetric simple exclusion process

activate flips between the two non-conserved species. Exact analytical results,
supported by Monte Carlo simulations, show two distinct phases, free flowing
phase and clustering phase. The clustering phase is characterized by constant
density and vanishing current of the non-conserved species, whereas the free
flowing phase is identified with non-monotonic density and non-monotonic finite
current of the same. The $n$-point spatial correlation between $n$ consecutive
vacancies grows with increasing $n$ in the clustering phase, indicating the
formation of two macroscopic clusters in this phase, one of the vacancies and
the other consisting of all the particles. We define a rearrangement parameter
that permutes the ordering of particles in the initial configuration, keeping
all the input parameters fixed. This rearrangement parameter reveals the
significant effect of non-ergodicity on the onset of clustering. For a special
choice of the microscopic dynamics, we connect the present model to a system of
run and tumble particles used to model active matter, where the two species
having opposite net bias manifest the two possible run directions of the run

the tumbling process.

provided stellar photometry to the astronomical community. We have used TESS
data to study rotational modulation in the light curves of a sample of
chemically peculiar stars with measured large-scale magnetic fields (mCP
stars). In general, mCP stars show inhomogeneous distributions of elements in
their atmospheres that lead to spectroscopic (line profile) and photometric
(light curve) variations commensurate with the rotational period. We analyzed
the available TESS data from 50 sectors for eight targets after post-processing
them in order to minimize systematic instrumental trends. Analysis of the light
curves allowed us to determine rotational periods for all eight of our targets.
For each star, we provide a phase diagram calculated using the derived period
from the light curves and from the available measurements of the disk-averaged
longitudinal magnetic field $\langle B_{\rm z}\rangle$. In most cases, the
phased light curve and $\langle B_{\rm z}\rangle$ measurements show consistent
variability. Using our rotation periods, and global stellar parameters derived
from fitting Balmer line profiles, and from Geneva and Str\""omgren-Crawford
photometry, we determined the equatorial rotational velocities and calculated
the respective critical rotational fractions $v_{\rm eq}/v_{\rm crit}$. We have
shown from our sample that the critical rotational fraction decreases with
stellar age, at a rate consistent with the magnetic braking observed in the
larger population of mCP stars.

(ELMs), each specialized to a different textual domain, such as scientific or
legal text. These ELMs can be added and removed to update data coverage,
ensembled to generalize to new domains, or averaged to collapse back to a
single LM for efficient inference. New ELMs are learned by branching from
(mixtures of) ELMs in the current set, further training the parameters on data
for the new domain, and then merging the resulting model back into the set for
future use. Experiments show that BTM improves in- and out-of-domain
perplexities as compared to GPT-style Transformer LMs, when controlling for
training cost. Through extensive analysis, we show that these results are
robust to different ELM initialization schemes, but require expert domain
specialization; LM ensembles with random data splits do not perform well. We
also present a study of scaling BTM into a new corpus of 64 domains (192B

call the Lethal Dose Conjecture. The conjecture states: If $n$ clean training
samples are needed for accurate predictions, then in a size-$N$ training set,
only $\Theta(N/n)$ poisoned samples can be tolerated while ensuring accuracy.
Theoretically, we verify this conjecture in multiple cases. We also offer a
more general perspective of this conjecture through distribution
discrimination. Deep Partition Aggregation (DPA) and its extension, Finite
Aggregation (FA) are recent approaches for provable defenses against data
poisoning, where they predict through the majority vote of many base models
trained from different subsets of training set using a given learner. The
conjecture implies that both DPA and FA are (asymptotically) optimal -- if we
have the most data-efficient learner, they can turn it into one of the most
robust defenses against data poisoning. This outlines a practical approach to
developing stronger defenses against poisoning via finding data-efficient
learners. Empirically, as a proof of concept, we show that by simply using
different data augmentations for base learners, we can respectively double and
triple the certified robustness of DPA on CIFAR-10 and GTSRB without

density. The system is solved with a copy of Liouville space that linearizes a

AMP updates and controllable residual terms, we lay out an analysis recipe to
characterize the finite-sample behavior of AMP in the presence of an
independent initialization, which is further generalized to allow for spectral
initialization. As two concrete consequences of the proposed analysis recipe:
(i) when solving $\mathbb{Z}_2$ synchronization, we predict the behavior of
spectrally initialized AMP for up to $O\big(\frac{n}{\mathrm{poly}\log n}\big)$
iterations, showing that the algorithm succeeds without the need of a
subsequent refinement stage (as conjectured recently by
\citet{celentano2021local}); (ii) we characterize the non-asymptotic behavior
of AMP in sparse PCA (in the spiked Wigner model) for a broad range of
signal-to-noise ratio.

by a plasma screen in the vicinity of the lens or somewhere between the source

image magnification, lensing probability (particularly for strong magnification
events), and the time delay between images. The magnification is suppressed
because of the broadening of the angular size of the source due to scattering
by the plasma. The time delay between images is modified as the result of
different dispersion measure (DM) along photon trajectories for different
images. Each of the image lightcurve is also broadened due to wave scattering
so that the images could have distinct temporal profiles. The first two effects
are most severe for stellar and sub-stellar mass lens, and the last one
(scatter broadening) for lenses and plasma screens at cosmological distances
from the source/observer. This could limit the use of FRBs to measure their
cosmic abundance. On the other hand, when the time delay between images is
large, such that the lightcurve of a transient source has two or more well
separated peaks, the different DMs along the wave paths of different images can
probe density fluctuations in the IGM on scales $\lesssim 10^{-6}$ rad and
explore the patchy reionization history of the universe using lensed FRBs at

far have focused on the universal terms, related to the Weyl anomaly in even

this work we study the entanglement entropy on a sphere of radius $R$ in a
large radius limit, for field theories with gravity duals. At large radius the
entropy admits a geometric expansion in powers of $R$; the leading term is the
well-known area term, and there are subleading contributions. These terms can
be physical, they contain information about the full renormalization group
flow, and they reproduce known monotonicity theorems in particular cases. We
set up an efficient method for calculating them using the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation for the holographic entanglement entropy. We first reproduce the known
result for the area term, the coefficient multiplying $R^{d-2}$ in the
entanglement entropy. We then obtain the holographic result for the $R^{d-4}$

unstable shear layer that is maintained by an imposed body force, is examined
by decomposing it into dissipationless linear eigenmodes of the initial
profiles. The down-gradient momentum flux, as expected, originates from the
large-scale instability. However, continual up-gradient momentum transport by
large-scale linearly stable but nonlinearly excited eigenmodes is identified,
and found to nearly cancel the down-gradient transport by unstable modes. The
stable modes effectuate this by depleting the large-scale turbulent
fluctuations via energy transfer to the mean flow. This establishes a physical
mechanism underlying the long-known observation that coherent vortices formed
from nonlinear saturation of the instability reduce turbulent transport and
fluctuations, as such vortices are composed of both the stable and unstable
modes, which are nearly equal in their amplitudes. The impact of magnetic
fields on the nonlinearly excited stable modes is then quantified. Even when
imposing a strong magnetic field that almost completely suppresses the
instability, the up-gradient transport by the stable modes is at least
two-thirds of the down-gradient transport by the unstable modes, whereas for
weaker fields, this fraction reaches up to $98\%$. These effects are persistent
with variations in magnetic Prandtl number and forcing strength. Finally,
continuum modes are shown to be energetically less important, but essential for
capturing the magnetic fluctuations and Maxwell stress. A simple analytical
scaling law is derived for their saturated turbulent amplitudes. It predicts
the fall-off rate as the inverse of the Fourier wavenumber, a property which is
confirmed in numerical simulations.

needs to be validated in a representative sample from the target population.
The finite size of the validation sample entails that there is uncertainty with
respect to estimates of model performance. We apply value-of-information
methodology as a framework to quantify the consequence of such uncertainty in
terms of NB. Methods: We define the Expected Value of Perfect Information
(EVPI) for model validation as the expected loss in NB due to not confidently
knowing which of the alternative decisions confers the highest NB at a given
risk threshold. We propose methods for EVPI calculations based on Bayesian or
ordinary bootstrapping of NBs, as well as an asymptotic approach supported by
the central limit theorem. We conducted brief simulation studies to compare the
performance of these methods, and used subsets of data from an international
clinical trial for predicting mortality after myocardial infarction as a case
study. Results: The three computation methods generated similar EVPI values in
simulation studies. In the case study, at the pre-specified threshold of 0.02,
the best decision with current information would be to use the model, with an
expected incremental NB of 0.0020 over treating all. At this threshold, EVPI
was 0.0005 (a relative EVPI of 25%). When scaled to the annual number of heart
attacks in the US, this corresponds to a loss of 400 true positives, or extra
19,600 false positives (unnecessary treatments) per year, indicating the value
of further model validation. As expected, the validation EVPI generally
declined with larger samples. Conclusion: Value-of-information methods can be
applied to the NB calculated during external validation of clinical prediction
models to provide a decision-theoretic perspective to the consequences of
uncertainty.

models with more realistic tail dependence characteristics are under active
development. They are theoretically justified, but give intractable
likelihoods, making computation challenging for small datasets and prohibitive
for continental-scale studies. We propose a process mixture model which
specifies spatial dependence in extreme values as a convex combination of a

properties but intractable likelihoods. To address this, we employ a unique
computational strategy where a feed-forward neural network is embedded in a
density regression model to approximate the conditional distribution at one

function to approximate the joint likelihood for all locations by way of a

on consumers' decisions. We present a negative result showing that such choice
models may not be identifiable. To overcome the identifiability problem, we
introduce a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation of the choice model,
which in a sense captures as much information about the choice model as could
information-theoretically be identified. We then consider the problem of
learning an approximation to this DAG representation in an active-learning
setting. We design an efficient active-learning algorithm to estimate the DAG
representation of the non-parametric choice model, which runs in polynomial
time when the set of frequent rankings is drawn uniformly at random. Our
algorithm learns the distribution over the most popular items of frequent
preferences by actively and repeatedly offering assortments of items and
observing the item chosen. We show that our algorithm can better recover a set
of frequent preferences on both a synthetic and publicly available dataset on
consumers' preferences, compared to the corresponding non-active learning
estimation algorithms. This demonstrates the value of our algorithm and
active-learning approaches more generally.

  Inferred Depth of Carbon Ignition in X-ray Superbursts","submitted",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Evidence has accumulated for an as-yet unaccounted for source of heat located
at shallow depths within the accreted neutron star crust. However, the nature
of this heat source is unknown. I demonstrate that the inferred depth of carbon
ignition in X-ray superbursts can be used as an additional constraint for the
magnitude and depth of shallow heating. The inferred shallow heating properties
are relatively insensitive to the assumed crust composition and carbon fusion
reaction rate. For low accretion rates, the results are weakly dependent on the
duration of the accretion outburst, so long as accretion has ensued for enough
time to replace the ocean down to the superburst ignition depth. For accretion
rates at the Eddington rate, results show a stronger dependence on the outburst
duration. Consistent with earlier work, it is shown that urca cooling does not
impact the calculated superburst ignition depth unless there is some proximity
in depth between the heating and cooling sources.

essential for a variety of vortex applications. Here, we investigate the mode
conversion efficiency (MCE), vortex structure and stability (in terms of vortex

designed and fabricated SZPs with varying topological charge of both binary and
kinoform profile. Kinoforms are known for their 100 % diffraction efficiency in
the ideal case. In this work, both types are contrasted with regard to the
vortex quality. Utilizing ptychographic coherent diffraction imaging and by
comparing to simulations the wavefront of the generated fields is
characterized. It was found, that the MCE and vortex structure exhibit the same
dependencies on material and ZP properties as the diffraction efficiency (DE)
and that the kinoform profile in this sense also improves the vortex quality.
With growing SZP charge the MCE decreases. The results link the parameters of
optics to the properties of the vortices and help to maximize the performance
of ZP based vortex generators for future applications.

like object removal and image editing. Deep GAN-based models greatly improve
the inpainting performance in structures and textures within the hole, but
might also generate unexpected artifacts like broken structures or color blobs.
Users perceive these artifacts to judge the effectiveness of inpainting models,
and retouch these imperfect areas to inpaint again in a typical retouching
workflow. Inspired by this workflow, we propose a new learning task of
automatic segmentation of inpainting perceptual artifacts, and apply the model
for inpainting model evaluation and iterative refinement. Specifically, we
first construct a new inpainting artifacts dataset by manually annotating
perceptual artifacts in the results of state-of-the-art inpainting models. Then
we train advanced segmentation networks on this dataset to reliably localize
inpainting artifacts within inpainted images. Second, we propose a new
interpretable evaluation metric called Perceptual Artifact Ratio (PAR), which
is the ratio of objectionable inpainted regions to the entire inpainted area.
PAR demonstrates a strong correlation with real user preference. Finally, we
further apply the generated masks for iterative image inpainting by combining
our approach with multiple recent inpainting methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the consistent decrease of artifact regions and inpainting quality
improvement across the different methods.

  Model-based solutions incorporate models of the physical acquisition in order

approach is deep-learning reconstruction, which has shown great promise in CT.
However, fully data-driven solutions typically need large amounts of training

heated and accelerated during the filamentary eruption on a fast time scale of
the order of 0.5 ms. A clearly non-thermal tail is formed in the distribution
of the kinetic energy that is of power-law shape and reaches 90 keV for some
particles. The acceleration is exclusively observed in the direction parallel
to the magnetic field, i.e. with a clear preference in counter-current
direction, and we show that the parallel electric field is the cause of the
observed acceleration. Most particles that escape from the system leave at one
distinct strike-line in the outer divertor leg at some time during their
energization. The escaping high energy electrons in the tail of the energy
distribution are not affected by collisions, they thus show characteristics of
runaway electrons. The mean square displacement indicates that transport in
energy space clearly is super-diffusive, and interpreting the acceleration
process as a random walk, we find that the distributions of energy-increments
exhibit exponential tails, and transport in energy space is equally important
of convective (systematic) and diffusive (stochastic) nature. By analyzing the
MHD simulations per se, it turns out that the histograms of the parallel
electric field in the edge region exhibit power-law shapes, and this clearly
non-Gaussian statistics is ultimately one of the reasons for the moderately
anomalous phenomena of particle transport that we find in energy space.

tasks of text detection and recognition into a single end-to-end framework.
Under this paradigm, both tasks are accomplished by operating over a shared
global feature map extracted from the input image. Among the main challenges
that end-to-end approaches face is the performance degradation when recognizing
text across scale variations (smaller or larger text), and arbitrary word
rotation angles. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a novel
global-to-local attention mechanism for text spotting, termed GLASS, that fuses
together global and local features. The global features are extracted from the
shared backbone, preserving contextual information from the entire image, while
the local features are computed individually on resized, high-resolution
rotated word crops. The information extracted from the local crops alleviates
much of the inherent difficulties with scale and word rotation. We show a
performance analysis across scales and angles, highlighting improvement over
scale and angle extremities. In addition, we introduce an orientation-aware
loss term supervising the detection task, and show its contribution to both
detection and recognition performance across all angles. Finally, we show that
GLASS is general by incorporating it into other leading text spotting
architectures, improving their text spotting performance. Our method achieves

The
goal is to match two sets of vertices to maximize the sum of the edge weights,
where for one set of vertices, each vertex and its corresponding edge weights
appear in a sequence. Currently, in the practical recommendation system or
search engine, the weights are decided by the inner product between the deep
representation of a user and the deep representation of an item. The standard
online matching needs to pay $nd$ time to linear scan all the $n$ items,
computing weight (assuming each representation vector has length $d$), and then
decide the matching based on the weights. However, in reality, the $n$ could be
very large, e.g. in online e-commerce platforms. Thus, improving the time of

with society has been developing into an important issue for exploration. In
this paper, we investigate the topic of democratization in the context of QT,
particularly quantum computing. The paper contains three main sections. First,
we briefly introduce different theories of democracy (participatory,
representative, and deliberative) and how the concept of democratization can be
formulated with respect to whether democracy is taken as an intrinsic or
instrumental value. Second, we give an overview of how the concept of
democratization is used in the QT field. Democratization is mainly adopted by
companies working on quantum computing and used in a very narrow understanding
of the concept. Third, we explore various narratives and counter-narratives
concerning democratization in QT. Finally, we explore the general efforts of
democratization in QT such as different forms of access, formation of grassroot
communities and special interest groups, the emerging culture of manifesto
writing, and how these can be located within the different theories of
democracy. In conclusion, we argue that although the ongoing efforts in the
democratization of QT are necessary steps towards the democratization of this
set of emerging technologies, they should not be accepted as sufficient to
argue that QT is a democratized field. We argue that more reflexivity and
responsiveness regarding the narratives and actions adopted by the actors in
the QT field, and making the underlying assumptions of ongoing efforts on
democratization of QT explicit, can result in a better technology for society.

higher gains through beamforming. However, for a massive MIMO system, this
feedback overhead is huge and grows linearly with the number of antennas. To
reduce the feedback overhead several compressive sensing (CS) techniques were
implemented in recent years but these techniques are often iterative and are
computationally complex to realize in power-constrained user equipment (UE).
Hence, a data-based deep learning approach took over in these recent years
introducing a variety of neural networks for CSI compression. Specifically,
transformer-based networks have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art
performance. However, the multi-head attention operation, which is at the core
of transformers, is computationally complex making transformers difficult to
implement on a UE. In this work, we present a lightweight transformer named
STNet which uses a spatially separable attention mechanism that is
significantly less complex than the traditional full-attention. Equipped with
this, STNet outperformed state-of-the-art models in some scenarios with
approximately $1/10^{th}$ of the resources.

learning. This help to evaluate the goodness of a feature in a given model.
Several techniques for estimating the importance of variables have been

and theoretical exploration of the emerging methods of variable importance
estimation, namely: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), the Predictive Error Function (PERF), Random

different kinds of real-life and simulated data. All these methods can handle
both regression and classification tasks seamlessly but all fail when it comes
to dealing with data containing missing values. The implementation has shown
that PERF has the best performance in the case of highly correlated data
closely followed by RF. PERF and XGBOOST are ""data-hungry"" methods, they had
the worst performance on small data sizes but they are the fastest when it
comes to the execution time. SVM is the most appropriate when many redundant
features are in the dataset. A surplus with the PERF is its natural cut-off at
zero helping to separate positive and negative scores with all positive scores
indicating essential and significant features while the negatives score
indicates useless features. RF and LASSO are very versatile in a way that they
can be used in almost all situations despite they are not giving the best

evaluated by the number of unlocked achievements (such as collecting resources)

We also provide critical insights of general interest for future work on

in the map is determined by comparing the visual sensor output with a set of

localization, the vehicle is tracked while it moves across the map by
continuously aligning the visual sensors' output with the current area of the
map that is being traversed. In this paper, we survey, discuss and compare the
latest methods for LiDAR based, camera based and cross-modal visual map

effectively solve this problem in the case of non-adaptive tensor recovery from

spatial system. Many of these patterns, including daily commuting, are cyclic
and quantifiable. These patterns capture physical phenomena tied to processes
studied in epidemiology, and other social, behavioral, and economic sciences.
This paper advances human mobility research by proposing a statistical method
for identifying locations that individual move to and through at a rate
proportionally higher than other locations, using commuting data for the
country of New Zealand as a case study. These locations are termed mobility
loci and they capture a global property of communities in which people commute.
The method makes use of a directed-graph representation where vertices
correspond to locations and traffic between locations correspond to edge
weights. Following a normalization, the graph can be regarded as a Markov chain
whose stationary distribution can be calculated. The proposed permutation
procedure is then applied to determine which stationary distributions are
larger than what would be expected, given the structure of the directed graph
and traffic between locations. The results of this method are evaluated,
including a comparison to what is already known about commuting patterns in the
area as well as a comparison with similar features.

a finite-dimensional Hilbert space of classical observables and evolves over

Observations of 3He+ in HII regions throughout the Galactic disk, however,

3He+ in the planetary nebula J320 (PN G190.3-17.7) with the Jansky Very Large

bound the volume of $T_h$ in terms of the volume of $T$ if $T_h$ can be
acquired by the finite average of the space $T$ with respect to the Minkowski

the covering number ratio between the space $T$ and the space $T_h$ can also be

distribution of their masses, spins, and eccentricity. While much has been
learned studying these parameters in turn, recent studies have explored the
joint distribution of binary black hole parameters in two or more dimensions.
Most notably, it has recently been argued that binary black hole mass ratio and
effective inspiral spin $\chi_\text{eff}$ are anti-correlated. We point out a
previously overlooked subtlety in such two-dimensional population studies: in
order to conduct a controlled test for correlation, one ought to fix the two
marginal distributions -- lest the purported correlation be driven by improved
fit in just one dimension. We address this subtlety using a tool from applied
statistics: the copula density function. We use the previous work correlating
mass ratio and $\chi_\text{eff}$ as a case study to demonstrate the power of
copulas in gravitational-wave astronomy while scrutinising their astrophysical
inferences. Our findings, however, affirm their conclusions that binary black
holes with unequal component masses exhibit larger $\chi_\text{eff}$ (98.7%

SA since it might reveal abnormal cardiac activity. Recent research on
ECG-based SA detection has focused on feature engineering techniques that
extract specific characteristics from multiple-lead ECG signals and use them as

extraction based on the detection of S peaks is proposed to enhance the
detection of adjacent SA segments using a single-lead ECG. In particular, ECG
features collected from a single lead (V2) are used to identify SA episodes. On
the extracted features, a CNN model is trained to detect SA. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method detects SA from single-lead ECG
data is more accurate than existing state-of-the-art methods, with 91.13%
classification accuracy, 92.58% sensitivity, and 88.75% specificity. Moreover,
the further usage of features associated with the S peaks enhances the

very flexible and easily amenable to many other VAE variants. Theoretically, we
study the effect of pretraining on private data. Empirically, we conduct
extensive experiments on image datasets to illustrate our superiority over

of machines are usually unavailable in normal conditions. Therefore, the models
employed have to learn acoustic representations with normal sounds for
training, and detect anomalous sounds while testing. In this article, we
propose a self-supervised dual-path Transformer (SSDPT) network to detect
anomalous sounds in machine monitoring. The SSDPT network splits the acoustic
features into segments and employs several DPT blocks for time and frequency

acoustic features. To address the problem of lack of anomalous sound, we adopt
a self-supervised learning approach to train the network with normal sound.
Specifically, this approach randomly masks and reconstructs the acoustic
features, and jointly classifies machine identity information to improve the
performance of anomalous sound detection. We evaluated our method on the

techniques such as ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) and functional
ultrasound (fUS). Current ultrafast ultrasound imaging is challenged by the
ultrahigh data bandwidth associated with the radio frequency (RF) signal, and
by the latency of the computationally expensive beamforming process. As such,
continuous ultrafast data acquisition and beamforming remain elusive with
existing software beamformers based on CPUs or GPUs. To address these
challenges, the proposed work introduces a novel method of implementing an
ultrafast ultrasound beamformer specifically for ultrafast plane wave imaging
(PWI) on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) by using high-level synthesis.
A parallelized implementation of the beamformer on a single FPGA was proposed
by 1) utilizing a delay compression technique to reduce the delay profile size,
which enables both run-time pre-calculated delay profile loading from external
memory and delay reuse 2) vectorizing channel data fetching which is enabled by
delay reuse, and 3) using fixed summing networks to reduce consumption of logic
resources. Our proposed method presents two unique advantages over current FPGA
beamformers: 1) high scalability that allows fast adaptation to different FPGA
resources and beamforming speed demands by using Xilinx High-Level Synthesis as
the development tool, and 2) allow a compact form factor design by using a
single FPGA to complete the beamforming instead of multiple FPGAs. With the
proposed method, a sustainable average beamforming rate of 4.83 G
samples/second in terms of input raw RF sample was achieved. The resulting
image quality of the proposed beamformer was compared with the software
beamformer on the Verasonics Vantage system for both phantom imaging and in

axes based on these common properties is restrictive because it does not
account for multiple properties occurring between the axes, and for local
properties that occur in small regions in the data. Also, many of these
techniques do not support the human-in-the-loop (HIL) paradigm, which is
crucial (i) for explainability and (ii) in cases where no single reordering
scheme fits the user goals. To alleviate these problems, we present PC-Expo, a
real-time visual analytics framework for all-in-one PCP line pattern detection,
and axes reordering. We studied the connection of line patterns in PCPs with
different data analysis tasks and datasets. PC-Expo expands prior work on PCP
axes reordering by developing real-time, local detection schemes for the 12
most common analysis tasks (properties). Users can choose the story they want
to present with PCPs by optimizing directly over their choice of properties.
These properties can be ranked, or combined using individual weights, creating
a custom optimization scheme for axes reordering. Users can control the
granularity at which they want to work with their detection scheme in the data,
allowing exploration of local regions. PC-Expo also supports HIL axes
reordering via local-property visualization, which shows the regions of
granular activity for every axis pair. Local-property visualization is helpful
for PCP axes reordering based on multiple properties, when no single reordering
scheme fits the user goals.

joints from videos. Recent transformer-based approaches focus on capturing the
spatiotemporal information from sequential 2D poses, which cannot model the
contextual depth feature effectively since the visual depth features are lost
in the step of 2D pose estimation. In this paper, we simplify the paradigm into
an end-to-end framework, Instance-guided Video Transformer (IVT), which enables
learning spatiotemporal contextual depth information from visual features
effectively and predicts 3D poses directly from video frames. In particular, we
firstly formulate video frames as a series of instance-guided tokens and each
token is in charge of predicting the 3D pose of a human instance. These tokens
contain body structure information since they are extracted by the guidance of
joint offsets from the human center to the corresponding body joints. Then,
these tokens are sent into IVT for learning spatiotemporal contextual depth. In
addition, we propose a cross-scale instance-guided attention mechanism to
handle the variational scales among multiple persons. Finally, the 3D poses of
each person are decoded from instance-guided tokens by coordinate regression.
Experiments on three widely-used 3D pose estimation benchmarks show that the
proposed IVT achieves state-of-the-art performances.

architecture design. In solving any supervised deep learning problem related to
segmentation, the success of the model that one builds depends upon the amount

contain well-annotated varied images for better working of the segmentation
model. Issues like this pertaining to annotations in a dataset can lead the

pre-existing image datasets and performing augmentations accordingly. Our

a single size-independent pooling layer to deal with multiple inputs, which are
inefficient for utilizing information among input images. Given multi-images

designed an inter-intra image feature fusion module to introduce the
inter-image representation into the per-image feature extraction. The extra
representation is used to guide the per-image feature extraction and eliminate
the ambiguity in normal estimation. We demonstrate the effect of our design on
a wide range of samples, especially on dark materials. Our method produces
significantly better results than the state-of-the-art methods on both

that regardless of measurement, one can assign to a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle

take any continuous real number. Suppose further that measurement maps the
c-valued spin variable from the continuous range of possible values onto the
binary standard quantum spin values $\pm 1$ while preserving the bipartite
correlation. Here, we show that such c-valued spin variables can indeed be
constructed. In this model, one may therefore argue that it is the requirement
of conservation of correlation which compels quantum measurement to violate the

statistical game which captures the model of measurement, wherein two parties
are asked to independently map a specific ensemble of pairs of real numbers
onto pairs of binary numbers $\pm 1$, under the requirement that the
correlation is preserved. The conservation of correlation forces the game to
respect the Bell theorem, which implies that there is a class of games no

spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles and circuits for local quantum spin measurement,

fundamental point of view, but it has also been recognized as a resource in a
variety of quantum information processing tasks and quantum technology. Here,
we propose a characterization of the general quantum correlation in bipartite
system in terms of direct laboratory operations using weak measurement with
postselection. We define a quantity based on the imaginary part of weak values
obtained via weak measurement of a local basis followed by a postselection of
another local basis, and an optimization procedure over all possible choices of
the two bases. We show that it satisfies certain desirable requirements for a
quantifier of general quantum correlations. It may be statistically interpreted
as the minimum genuine quantum share of uncertainty. It is a faithful witness
of entanglement for general pure states, giving an observable lower bound to a
scaled square root of the linear entropy of entanglement. We then suggest an
information theoretic interpretation of the general quantum correlation in a
multipartite state as the minimum mean absolute error in an optimal estimation
of any local measurement basis, based on the outcomes of local projective
measurement on the state, in the worst case scenario.

that the variance of $f$ is $\Omega(1)$ and all its individual influences are
bounded by $\tau$. We show that when restricting all but a
$\rho=\tilde{\Omega}((\log(1/\tau))^{-1})$ fraction of the coordinates, the
restricted function remains nonconstant with overwhelming probability. This
bound is essentially optimal, as witnessed by the tribes function
$\mathrm{TRIBES}=\mathrm{AND}_{n/C\log n}\circ\mathrm{OR}_{C\log n}$.
  We extend it to an anti-concentration result, showing that the restricted
function has nontrivial variance with probability $1-o(1)$. This gives a sharp
version of the ""it ain't over till it's over"" theorem due to Mossel, O'Donnell,
and Oleszkiewicz. Our proof is discrete, and avoids the use of the invariance
principle.
  We also show two consequences of our above result: (i) As a corollary, we
prove that for a uniformly random input $x$, the block sensitivity of $f$ at
$x$ is $\tilde{\Omega}(\log(1/\tau))$ with probability $1-o(1)$. This should be
compared with the implication of Kahn, Kalai, and Linial's result, which
implies that the average block sensitivity of $f$ is $\Omega(\log(1/\tau))$.
(ii) Combining our proof with a well-known result due to O'Donnell, Saks,
Schramm, and Servedio, one can also conclude that: Restricting all but a
$\rho=\tilde\Omega(1/\sqrt{\log (1/\tau) })$ fraction of the coordinates of a
monotone function $f$, then the restricted function has decision tree
complexity $\Omega(\tau^{-\Theta(\rho)})$ with probability $\Omega(1)$.

for a user by their tagging behaviors. It is crucial for many applications with
tagging capabilities like last.fm or movielens. Recently, many efforts have
been devoted to improving Tag-aware recommendation systems (TRS) with Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCN), which has become new state-of-the-art for the
general recommendation. However, some solutions are directly inherited from GCN
without justifications, which is difficult to alleviate the sparsity,
ambiguity, and redundancy issues introduced by tags, thus adding to
difficulties of training and degrading recommendation performance.
  In this work, we aim to simplify the design of GCN to make it more concise
for TRS. We propose a novel tag-aware recommendation model named Light
Folksonomy Graph Collaborative Filtering (LFGCF), which only includes the
essential GCN components. Specifically, LFGCF first constructs Folksonomy
Graphs from the records of user assigning tags and item getting tagged. Then we
leverage the simple design of aggregation to learn the high-order
representations on Folksonomy Graphs and use the weighted sum of the embeddings
learned at several layers for information updating. We share tags embeddings to
bridge the information gap between users and items. Besides, a regularization
function named TransRT is proposed to better depict user preferences and item
features. Extensive hyperparameters experiments and ablation studies on three
real-world datasets show that LFGCF uses fewer parameters and significantly
outperforms most baselines for the tag-aware top-N recommendations.

(PBHs) and weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), WIMPs can be accreted
onto PBHs to form ultracompact minihalos (UCMHs) with a density spike in the
early universe. Compared with the classical dark matter halo, UCMHs are formed
earlier and have a higher density of center. Since the annihilation rate is
proportional to the squared number density of WIMPs, it is expected that WIMPs

Between the time of recombination and matter-radiation equality, the energy
released from WIMPs annihilation within UCMHs is injected into the Universe

silicon-glass, featuring one or several pairs of acoustically excited sharp
edges at side channels that drive a pumping flow throughout the chip and
produce a strong mixing flow in their vicinity. The chip is simultaneously
capable of focusing cells and microparticles that are suspended in the flow.
The multifunctional micropump provides a continuous flow across a wide range of
excitation frequencies (80kHz-2MHz), with flow rates ranging from nL/min to
$\mu$L/min, depending on the excitation parameters. In the low-voltage regime,
the flow rate depends quadratically on the voltage applied to the piezoelectric
transducer, making the pump programmable. The behaviour in the system is
elucidated with finite element method simulations, which are in good agreement
with experimentally observed behaviour. The acoustic radiation force arising
due to a fluidic channel resonance is responsible for the focusing of cells and
microparticles, while the streaming produced by the pair of sharp edges
generates the pumping and the mixing flow. If cell focusing is detrimental for
a certain application, it can also be avoided by exciting the system away from
the resonance frequency of the fluidic channel. The device, with its unique
bundle of functionalities, displays great potential for various bio-chemical
applications.

  note: text overlap with arXiv:2204.03502",,,,"eess.SY cs.NI cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network slicing is a critical driver for guaranteeing the diverse service
level agreements (SLA) in 5G and future networks. Inter-slice radio resource
allocation (IS-RRA) in the radio access network (RAN) is very important.
However, user mobility brings new challenges for optimal IS-RRA. This paper
first proposes a soft and hard hybrid slicing framework where a common slice is
introduced to realize a trade-off between isolation and spectrum efficiency
(SE). To address the challenges posed by user mobility, we propose a two-step
deep learning-based algorithm: joint long short-term memory (LSTM)-based
network state prediction and deep Q network (DQN)-based slicing strategy. In
the proposal, LSTM networks are employed to predict traffic demand and the
location of each user in a slicing window level. Moreover, channel gain is
mapped by location and a radio map. Then, the predicted channel gain and
traffic demand are input to the DQN to output the precise slicing adjustment.
Finally, experiment results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed slicing
framework: the slices' SLA can be guaranteed well, and the proposed algorithm
can achieve near-optimal performance in terms of the SLA satisfaction ratio,
isolation degree and SE.

against environmental changes. If the context in every class is evenly
distributed, OOD would be trivial because the context can be easily removed due
to an underlying principle: class is invariant to context. However, collecting
such a balanced dataset is impractical. Learning on imbalanced data makes the
model bias to context and thus hurts OOD. Therefore, the key to OOD is context
balance. We argue that the widely adopted assumption in prior work, the context
bias can be directly annotated or estimated from biased class prediction,
renders the context incomplete or even incorrect. In contrast, we point out the
everoverlooked other side of the above principle: context is also invariant to
class, which motivates us to consider the classes (which are already labeled)
as the varying environments to resolve context bias (without context labels).
We implement this idea by minimizing the contrastive loss of intra-class sample
similarity while assuring this similarity to be invariant across all classes.
On benchmarks with various context biases and domain gaps, we show that a
simple re-weighting based classifier equipped with our context estimation

which, one can synthesize state-feedback controllers for interconnected systems

a sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization approach to search for multiple storage

construct barrier certificates for interconnected systems based on storage
certificates of individual subsystems. The proposed dissipativity-type
compositional conditions can leverage the structure of the interconnection
topology and be fulfilled independently of the number or gains of subsystems.
We eventually employ the constructed barrier certificate and quantify upper

metastable lifetime of a ferromagnetic system. In this regard, particularly the
Ising model and the Blume-Capel model, have been simulated in the presence of
an externally applied magnetic field by the Monte-Carlo simulation technique
based on the Metropolis algorithm. Magnetisation switching is found to be
faster in the presence of disorder, modelled here by a quenched random field.
The strength of the random field is observed to play a similar role to that
played by temperature. Becker-D\""oring theory of classical nucleation
(originally proposed for the spin-1/2 Ising system) has been verified in the
random field Ising model. However, a stronger random field affects the
nucleation regime. In a cubic Ising lattice, surface reversal time is found to
be different from the bulk reversal time. That distinct behaviour of the
surface in contrast to the bulk has been studied here by introducing a relative
interfacial interaction strength ($R$). Depending on $R$, temperature, and
applied field, a competitive switching of magnetisation of surface and bulk is
noticed. The effect of anisotropy ($D$) on the metastable lifetime has been
investigated. We report a linear dependency of the mean macroscopic reversal
time on a suitably defined microscopic reversal time. The saturated
magnetisation $M_f$, after the reversal, is noticed to be strongly dependent on
$D$. $M_f$, $D$, and $h$ (field) are found to follow a proposed scaling
relation. Finally, Becker-D\""oring theory as well as Avrami's law are verified

number of accessible spin states.

fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT), this leads paradoxically to a
dissipative conductance even in the zero frequency limit. In this article, we
directly measure the supercurrent noise in a phase-biased SNS ring inductively

notion of local minimality in this paper. We are interested in finding a
locally minimal defensive alliance of maximum size. In Locally Minimal
Defensive Alliance problem, given an undirected graph $G$, a positive integer
$k$, the question is to check whether $G$ has a locally minimal defensive
alliance of size at least $k$. This problem is known to be NP-hard, but its
parameterized complexity remains open until now. We enhance our understanding
of the problem from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity. The main results
of the paper are the following: (1) Locally Minimal Defensive Alliance
restricted to the graphs of minimum degree at least 2 is fixed-parameter
tractable (FPT) when parameterized by the combined parameters solution size
$k$, and maximum degree $\Delta$ of the input graph, (2) Locally Minimal
Defensive Alliance on the graphs of minimum degree at least 2, admits a kernel
with at most $k^{k^{\mathcal{O}(k)}}$ vertices. In particular, the problem
parameterized by $k$ restricted to $C_3$-free and $C_4$-free graphs of minimum
degree at least 2, admits a kernel with at most $k^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$ vertices.
Moreover, we prove that the problem on planar graphs of minimum degree at least
2, admits an FPT algorithm with running time
$\mathcal{O}^{*}(k^{2^{\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k})}})$. Finally, we prove that (4)
Locally Minimal Defensive Alliance Extension is NP-complete.

levels. There are, however, still many unclear points around the pitching
strategy. The two elements make it difficult to measure the effect of pitching
strategy. First, most public datasets do not include location data where the
catcher demands a ball, which is essential information to obtain the battery's
intent. Second, there are many confounders associated with pitching/batting
results when evaluating pitching strategy. We here clarify the effect of
pitching attempts to a specific location, e.g., inside or outside. We employ a
causal inference framework called stratified analysis using a propensity score
to evaluate the effects while removing the effect of disturbing factors. We
used a pitch-by-pitch dataset of Japanese professional baseball games held in
2014-2019, which includes location data where the catcher demands a ball. The
results reveal that an outside pitching attempt is more effective than an
inside one to minimize allowed run on average. Besides, the stratified analysis
shows that the outside pitching attempt was always effective despite the
magnitude of the estimated batter's ability, and the ratio of pitched inside
for pitcher/batter. Our analysis would provide practical insights into
selecting a pitching strategy to minimize allowed runs.

wide variety of robotic manipulation tasks including grasping, packing,

usually miss objects because of the significant occlusion among instances and
causes incorrect prediction due to the visual ambiguity with the high object
crowdedness. In this paper, we propose an interactive exploration framework
called Smart Explorer for recognizing all objects in dense clutters. Our Smart
Explorer physically interacts with the clutter to maximize the recognition
performance while minimize the number of motions, where the false positives and
negatives can be alleviated effectively with the optimal accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs. Specifically, we first collect the multi-view RGB-D images of the
clutter and reconstruct the corresponding point cloud. By aggregating the
instance segmentation of RGB images across views, we acquire the instance-wise
point cloud partition of the clutter through which the existed classes and the
number of objects for each class are predicted. The pushing actions for
effective physical interaction are generated to sizably reduce the recognition
uncertainty that consists of the instance segmentation entropy and multi-view
object disagreement. Therefore, the optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off of
object recognition in dense clutter is achieved via iterative instance
prediction and physical interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
Smart Explorer acquires promising recognition accuracy with only a few actions,
which also outperforms the random pushing by a large margin.

developed and evaluated for incompressible flows around a rectangular cylinder
at moderate Reynolds numbers. Near-wall flow simulation remains a central
challenge in aerodynamic modeling: RANS predictions of separated flows are
often inaccurate, while LES can require prohibitively small near-wall mesh
sizes. The DL-LES model is trained using adjoint PDE optimization methods to
match, as closely as possible, direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. It is
then evaluated out-of-sample (i.e., for new aspect ratios and Reynolds numbers
not included in the training data) and compared against a standard LES model
(the dynamic Smagorinsky model). The DL-LES model outperforms dynamic
Smagorinsky and is able to achieve accurate LES predictions on a relatively
coarse mesh (downsampled from the DNS grid by a factor of four in each
Cartesian direction). We study the accuracy of the DL-LES model for predicting
the drag coefficient, mean flow, and Reynolds stress. A crucial challenge is
that the LES quantities of interest are the steady-state flow statistics; for
example, the time-averaged mean velocity $\bar{u}(x) = \displaystyle \lim_{t
\rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t u(s,x) ds$. Calculating the
steady-state flow statistics therefore requires simulating the DL-LES equations
over a large number of flow times through the domain; it is a non-trivial
question whether an unsteady partial differential equation model whose
functional form is defined by a deep neural network can remain stable and
accurate on $t \in [0, \infty)$. Our results demonstrate that the DL-LES model
is accurate and stable over large physical time spans, enabling the estimation
of the steady-state statistics for the velocity, fluctuations, and drag

are often under some form of stress. Most real materials are also, to some
degree, anisotropic due to their microstructure, a characteristic often called
the `texture anisotropy'. This anisotropy can stem from preferential grain
alignment in polycrystalline materials, aligned micro-cracks, or structural
reinforcement, such as collagen bundles in biological tissues, steel rods in
prestressed concrete and reinforcing fibres in composites. Here we establish a
framework for initially stressed solids with transverse texture anisotropy. We
consider that the strain energy per unit mass of the reference is an explicit
function of the elastic deformation gradient, the initial stress tensor, and
the texture anisotropy. We determine the corresponding constitutive relations
and develop examples of nonlinear strain energies which depend explicitly on
the initial stress and direction of texture anisotropy. As an application, we
then employ these models to analyse the stress distribution of an inflated
initially stressed cylinder with texture anisotropy, and the tension of a
welded metal plate. We also deduce the elastic moduli needed to describe linear
elasticity from stress reference with transverse texture anisotropy. As an
example we show how to measure the stress with small-amplitude shear waves.

customers. Each station is a ./M/\infty queue with service (migration) rate mu.
Upon departure, a customer is routed at random to another station. In addition
to migration, these customers are subject to an SIS (Susceptible, Infected,
Susceptible) dynamics: customers are either I for infected, or S for
susceptible. They can swap their state either from I to S or from S to I only
in stations. At any station, each S customer becomes I with rate alpha Y if
there are Y infected customers in the station, and each I customer recovers and
becomes S with rate beta. We let N tend to infinity and assume that lim_{N\to

there exists a stationary regime where the epidemic survives in the
thermodynamic limit. We establish several structural properties of the system,
which allow us to give the phase transition diagram of this thermodynamic limit

for which we found no explicit solution. This SIS model is one among several
companion stochastic processes with migration and contagion. Two of them are
discussed as they provide some bounds and approximations to SIS. These two
variants are the DOCS (Departure On Change of State) and the AIR (Averaged

mean-field model where the infection mechanism is based on the empirical
average of the number of infected customers in all stations. The latter admits
a product-form solution. DOCS features accelerated migration in that each
change of SIS state implies an immediate departure. It leads to another
wave-type PDE that admits a closed-form solution.

recurrent neural networks trained to approximate such value functions
internally filter the posterior probability distribution of the current state
given the history, called the belief. More precisely, we show that, as a
recurrent neural network learns the Q-function, its hidden states become more
and more correlated with the beliefs of state variables that are relevant to
optimal control. This correlation is measured through their mutual information.
In addition, we show that the expected return of an agent increases with the
ability of its recurrent architecture to reach a high mutual information
between its hidden states and the beliefs. Finally, we show that the mutual
information between the hidden states and the beliefs of variables that are
irrelevant for optimal control decreases through the learning process. In
summary, this work shows that in its hidden states, a recurrent neural network

also high density and consistent with a common origin. From radar data we have
isolated 19,007 DSX orbits through application of a novel convex hull approach
to determine stream membership. We find at the peak the mean semi-major axis is
near 1 AU, eccentricity is 0.86 and that both decrease as a function of solar
longitude. The inclination averages 25 degrees at the peak but increases over
time. Noticeable DSX activity extends from solar longitude 173-196$^{\circ}$
with a flux plateau between 186 - 189$^{\circ}$. The peak flux is $2 \pm 0.05
\times 10^{-3}$ km$^{-2}$ hr$^{-1}$, equivalent to a ZHR of 20. We estimate a
true differential mass index for the shower of $s = 1.64 \pm 0.06$ at the time

mass of the DSX stream is estimated to be $10^{16}$ g, the same order as 2005

still no consensus on how downsampling should apply to graphs and linked data.
Indeed reductions in graph data are still needed for the goals described above,
but reduction mechanisms do not have the same focus on preserving topological
structures and properties, while allowing for resolution-tuning, as is the case
in regular data downsampling.
  In this paper, we take a step in this direction, introducing a unifying
interpretation of downsampling in regular and graph data. In particular, we
define a graph coarsening mechanism which is a graph-structured counterpart of
controllable equispaced coarsening mechanisms in regular data. We prove
theoretical guarantees for distortion bounds on path lengths, as well as the
ability to preserve key topological properties in the coarsened graphs. We
leverage these concepts to define a graph pooling mechanism that we empirically
assess in graph classification tasks, providing a greedy algorithm that allows
efficient parallel implementation on GPUs, and showing that it compares
favorably against pooling methods in literature.

slide images (WSIs) for diagnostic pathology. A fundamental challenge of MIL on
WSI classification is to discover the \textit{critical instances} that trigger
the bag label. However, previous methods are primarily designed under the
independent and identical distribution hypothesis (\textit{i.i.d}), ignoring
either the correlations between instances or heterogeneity of tumours. In this
paper, we propose a novel multiplex-detection-based multiple instance learning
(MDMIL) to tackle the issues above. Specifically, MDMIL is constructed by the
internal query generation module (IQGM) and the multiplex detection module
(MDM) and assisted by the memory-based contrastive loss during training.
Firstly, IQGM gives the probability of instances and generates the internal
query (IQ) for the subsequent MDM by aggregating highly reliable features after
the distribution analysis. Secondly, the multiplex-detection cross-attention
(MDCA) and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) in MDM cooperate to generate the
final representations for the WSI. In this process, the IQ and trainable
variational query (VQ) successfully build up the connections between instances
and significantly improve the model's robustness toward heterogeneous tumours.
At last, to further enforce constraints in the feature space and stabilize the
training process, we adopt a memory-based contrastive loss, which is
practicable for WSI classification even with a single sample as input in each
iteration. We conduct experiments on three computational pathology datasets,
e.g., CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC datasets. The superior accuracy and
AUC demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MDMIL over other
state-of-the-art methods.

Firstly, it solves the hitherto open-problem of a lack of generic Virtual
Execution Environments (VXEs) for rehosting by synthesizing processor
simulators from Ghidra's language definitions. In doing so, MetaEmu can
simulate any processor supported by a vast and growing library of open-source
definitions. In MetaEmu, we use a specification-based approach to cover
peripherals, execution models, and analyses, which allows our framework to be
easily extended. Secondly, MetaEmu can rehost and analyze multiple targets,
each of different architecture, simultaneously, and share analysis facts
between each target's analysis environment, a technique we call inter-device
analysis. We show that the flexibility afforded by our approach does not lead
to a performance trade-off -- MetaEmu lifts rehosted firmware to an optimized
intermediate representation, and provides performance comparable to existing
emulation tools, such as Unicorn. Our evaluation spans five different
architectures, bare-metal and RTOS-based firmware, and three kinds of

which can be rehosted or emulated by current tools, due to lack of processor

indeed essential. We employ quantum chemical calculations to estimate the

high-quality variable-length shapelets to discriminate different clusters. In
this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder-shapelet approach (AUTOSHAPE), which
is the first study to take the advantage of both autoencoder and shapelet for
determining shapelets in an unsupervised manner. An autoencoder is specially
designed to learn high-quality shapelets. More specifically, for guiding the
latent representation learning, we employ the latest self-supervised loss to
learn the unified embeddings for variable-length shapelet candidates (time
series subsequences) of different variables, and propose the diversity loss to
select the discriminating embeddings in the unified space. We introduce the
reconstruction loss to recover shapelets in the original time series space for
clustering. Finally, we adopt Davies Bouldin index (DBI) to inform AUTOSHAPE of
the clustering performance during learning. We present extensive experiments on
AUTOSHAPE. To evaluate the clustering performance on univariate time series
(UTS), we compare AUTOSHAPE with 15 representative methods using UCR archive
datasets. To study the performance of multivariate time series (MTS), we
evaluate AUTOSHAPE on 30 UEA archive datasets with 5 competitive methods. The
results validate that AUTOSHAPE is the best among all the methods compared. We
interpret clusters with shapelets, and can obtain interesting intuitions about
clusters in two UTS case studies and one MTS case study, respectively.

for modeling spatio-temporal processes governed by advection-diffusion
equations. The central idea is to approximate the process by a truncated
Fourier series and let the governing physics determine the dynamics of the
spectral coefficients. However, because many spatio-temporal processes in real
applications are non-periodic with boundary discontinuities, the well-known
Gibbs phenomenon and ripple artifact almost always exist in the outputs
generated by such models due to truncation of the Fourier series. Hence, the
key contribution of this paper is to propose a physics-informed spatio-temporal
modeling approach that significantly suppresses the Gibbs phenomenon when
modeling spatio-temporal advection-diffusion processes. The proposed approach
starts with a data flipping procedure for the process respectively along the
horizontal and vertical directions (as if we were unfolding a piece of paper
that has been folded twice along the two directions). Because the flipped
process becomes spatially periodic and has a complete waveform without any
boundary discontinuities, the Gibbs phenomenon disappears even if the Fourier
series is truncated. Then, for the flipped process and given the Partial
Differential Equation (PDE) that governs the process, this paper extends an
existing PDE-based spatio-temporal model by obtaining the new temporal dynamics
of the spectral coefficients, while maintaining the physical interpretation of
the flipped process. Numerical investigations based on a real dataset have been
performed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach. It is found
that the proposed approach effectively suppresses the Gibbs Phenomenon and
significantly reduces the ripple artifact in modeling spatio-temporal
advection-diffusion processes. Computer code is available on GitHub.

Germany is modeled as an electric island versus embedded in an interconnected

technology-specific capacity bounds on renewable energies. Our analysis aims to
inform other energy system modelers as well as policy makers. The findings
suggest that large-scale hydrogen storage can provide valuable flexibility to

are more pronounced in the absence of flexibility from geographical balancing.
We further find that the effects of green hydrogen production on the optimal

  networks","11 pages, 7 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.107.014301",,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The nonbacktracking matrix, and the related nonbacktracking centrality (NBC)
play a crucial role in models of percolation-type processes on networks, such
as non-recurrent epidemics. Here we study the localization of NBC in infinite
sparse networks that contain an arbitrary finite subgraph. Assuming the local
tree-likeness of the enclosing network, and that branches emanating from the
finite subgraph do not intersect at finite distances, we show that the largest
eigenvalue of the nonbacktracking matrix of the composite network is equal to
the highest of the two largest eigenvalues: that of the finite subgraph and of
the enclosing network. In the localized state, when the largest eigenvalue of
the subgraph is the highest of the two, we derive explicit expressions for the
NBCs of nodes in the subgraph and other nodes in the network. In this state,
nonbacktracking centrality is concentrated on the subgraph and its immediate
neighbourhood in the enclosing network. We obtain simple, exact formulas in the
case where the enclosing network is uncorrelated. We find that the mean NBC
decays exponentially around the finite subgraph, at a rate which is independent
of the structure of the enclosing network, contrary to what was found for the
localization of the principal eigenvector of the adjacency matrix. Numerical
simulations confirm that our results provide good approximations even in
moderately sized, loopy, real-world networks.

  Transport Disruptions",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Urban metro and tram networks are regularly subject to planned disruptions,
including closures, resulting from the need to maintain and renew
infrastructure. In this study, we first empirically analyse the passenger
demand response to planned public transport disruptions based on individual
passenger travel behaviour, based on which we infer generalised journey time
and cost elasticities for different passenger groups and time periods of the
day. Second, we develop a model which enables predicting public transport
demand for individual origin-destination pairs affected by a closure. The model
is trained based on the empirically observed travel behaviour. The proposed
method is applied to a case study closure in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, based
on which we empirically derive generalised journey time and generalised journey
cost elasticities. Our results suggest that passengers demand response is lower
for frequent users of the public transport network, as well as during weekdays,
especially during the peak periods. Arguably, this stems from a higher share of
captive passengers with a mandatory journey purpose in these segments, who will
continue making their journey nevertheless. During weekends, with typically
higher shares of leisure related journeys, a much more pronounced demand
response is found. The estimated neural network regression model is able to
predict passenger demand during public transport closures with a high level of
accuracy. This provides public transport agencies more precise insights into
the impact of closures on their revenue losses and on the potential need for
resources reallocation.

astrophysics. The intriguing existence of progressively complex and apparently
improbable living beings should be a general tendency of life in the Universe.
We are looking for general physical laws governing the growth of complexity in
any astrophysical environment. We posit the existence of a vital scalar field.
This scalar is sensitive to the gradient of the inverse of specific entropy,
such that its distribution tends to very high values in the interior of living
beings. Besides the classical mutations, vital field driven mutations only
produce decrements of entropy. The field equations give rise to the existence
of vital waves. This theory is able to deal with both the origin of life and
the evolution of life. We show that the growth of complexity is accelerated by
the vital field.

  Open Competition","14 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables",,,,"cs.NI cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge about the exact positioning of aircraft is crucial in many
settings. Consequently, the opportunistic and independent localization of
aircraft based on their communication has been a longstanding problem and
subject of much research. Originating from military settings, the capability to
conduct aircraft localization has moved first towards the institutional civil
aviation domain and can now be undertaken by anyone who has access to multiple
cheap software-defined radios. Based on these technological developments, many
crowdsourced sensor networks have sprung up, which collect air traffic control
data in order to localize aircraft and visualize the airspace. Due to their
unplanned and uncontrolled deployment and heterogeneous receiver technology
traditional solutions to the Aircraft Localization Problem (ALP) can either not
be applied or do not perform in a satisfactory manner. In order to deal with
this issue and to find novel approaches to the ALP itself, we have designed and
executed a multi-stage open competition, conducted both offline and online.
  In this paper, we discuss the setup, experiences, and lessons learned from
this Aircraft Localization Competition. We report from a diverse set of
technical approaches, comprising 72 participating teams over three stages. The
participants reached a localization accuracy of up to 25 meters in a setting
with fully GPS-synchronized receivers and 78 meters in a largely unsynchronized
receiver setting. These results constitute a significant improvement over the
previous baseline used in the OpenSky research network.
  We compare the results of the study, discuss the current state of the art,
and highlight the areas that, based on our experience from organizing a
competition, need to be improved for optimal adoption of the competitive
approach for other scenarios.
