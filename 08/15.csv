Instance-Outside noise from background pixels in the receptive field, while
ignoring Instance-Inside noise in the input depth data. In this paper, we

lightweight depth denoising module is proposed in the second step to calibrate
the depth feature before feeding it into the pose regression network. Extensive

outperforming Uni6D without sacrificing too much inference efficiency. It also
reduces the need for annotated real data that requires costly labeling.

First, we offline split the vocab search space into disjoint clusters given the
hidden context vector of the decoder output, which results in much smaller
vocab columns for vocab projection. Second, at inference time, the proposed
method predicts the clusters and candidate active tokens for hidden context
vectors at the vocab projection. This paper also includes analysis of different

could be fulfilled by simply retraining the recommendation model from scratch,
but that would be too slow and too expensive in practice. In this paper, we
investigate fast machine unlearning techniques for recommender systems that can
remove the effect of a small amount of training data from the recommendation
model without incurring the full cost of retraining. A natural idea to speed
this process up is to fine-tune the current recommendation model on the
remaining training data instead of starting from a random initialization. This
warm-start strategy indeed works for neural recommendation models using
standard 1st-order neural network optimizers (like AdamW). However, we have
found that even greater acceleration could be achieved by employing 2nd-order
(Newton or quasi-Newton) optimization methods instead. To overcome the
prohibitively high computational cost of 2nd-order optimizers, we propose a new
recommendation unlearning approach AltEraser which divides the optimization
problem of unlearning into many small tractable sub-problems. Extensive
experiments on three real-world recommendation datasets show promising results
of AltEraser in terms of consistency (forgetting thoroughness), accuracy

unlearning for state-of-the-art neural recommendation models.

to the large domain gap between a sparse, irregular sketch and a regular, dense

to directly predict the 3D coordinates, but they usually suffer from losing
fine details that are not faithful to the input sketch. Through analyzing the
3D-to-2D projection process, we notice that the density map that characterizes
the distribution of 2D point clouds (i.e., the probability of points projected
at each location of the projection plane) can be used as a proxy to facilitate
the reconstruction process. To this end, we first translate a sketch via an
image translation network to a more informative 2D representation that can be
used to generate a density map. Next, a 3D point cloud is reconstructed via a
two-stage probabilistic sampling process: first recovering the 2D points (i.e.,
the x and y coordinates) by sampling the density map; and then predicting the
depth (i.e., the z coordinate) by sampling the depth values at the ray
determined by each 2D point. Extensive experiments are conducted, and both
quantitative and qualitative results show that our proposed approach
significantly outperforms other baseline methods.

findings on the realization of C-IRS operating at 26 GHz and measurements in
anechoic chamber, which validate the analytical derivations. To demonstrate the

that, when the percentage of vehicles equipping a C-IRS increases, the

dynamically, leading to different data distributions. When a model learns
multi-distribution, it always forgets or overfits. We suggest that meaningful

significantly, as light is refracted out of the line of sight by foreground
plasma lenses. Despite recent efforts, the nature of these lenses has remained
a puzzle, because any roughly round lens would be so highly overpressurized
relative to the interstellar medium that it could only exist for about a year.
This, combined with a lack of constraints on distances and velocities, has led
to a plethora of theoretical models. We present observations of a dramatic
double-lensing event in pulsar PSR~B0834+06 and use a novel phase-retrieval
technique to show that the data can be reproduced remarkably well with a
two-screen model: one screen with many small lenses and another with a single,
strong one. We further show that the latter lens is so strong that it would
inevitably cause extreme scattering events. Our observations show that the lens
moves slowly and is highly elongated on the sky. If similarly elongated along
the line of sight, as would arise naturally from a sheet of plasma viewed
nearly edge-on, no large over-pressure is required and hence the lens could be
long-lived. Our new technique opens up the possibility of probing interstellar
plasma structures in detail, leading to understanding crucial for
high-precision pulsar timing and the subsequent detection of gravitational

methods that rely on learning local information typically cannot do well in
preserving color conformity and long-range structural similarity, resulting in
unnatural color transition and texture artifacts. In order to tackle these
challenges, we propose a global priors guided modulation network (GPGMNet) for
joint SR-ITM. In particular, we design a global priors extraction module (GPEM)
to extract color conformity prior and structural similarity prior that are
beneficial for ITM and SR tasks, respectively. To further exploit the global
priors and preserve spatial information, we devise multiple global priors
guided spatial-wise modulation blocks (GSMBs) with a few parameters for
intermediate feature modulation, in which the modulation parameters are
generated by the shared global priors and the spatial features map from the
spatial pyramid convolution block (SPCB). With these elaborate designs, the
GPGMNet can achieve higher visual quality with lower computational complexity.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed GPGMNet is superior to the

excitation of extremely high-quality factor trapped modes (also known as the
bound states in the continuum, BICs) are of great interest since they allow the
implementation of laser and sensor devices with outstanding characteristics. In
this paper, we discuss how one can utilize the anisotropic properties of novel
materials (transition metal dichalcogenides, TMDs), particularly, the bulk
molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), to realize the excitation of trapped modes in
dielectric metasurfaces. The bulk MoS2 is a thin-film structure in which the
light wave behaves the same way as that in the uniaxial anisotropic material
with the form birefringence property. Our metasurface is composed of an array
of disk-shaped nanoparticles (resonators) made of the MoS2 material under the
assumption that the anisotropy axis of MoS2 can be tilted to the rotation axis
of the disks. We perform a detailed analysis of eigenwaves and scattering
properties of such anisotropic resonators as well as the spectral features of
the metasurface revealing dependence of the excitation conditions of the
trapped mode on the anisotropy axis orientation of the MoS2 material used.

diverse properties and functionalities, thus they have been widely used in many
emerging applications in engineering, energy, and medicine. In particular, some
applications such as actuation, molecule release, and friction switch require
the polymer brushes to change their heights between dry and wet states, and
maximizing such height change is critical for the optimal performance of these
applications. While scaling laws have long been proposed to qualitatively
determine brush heights, a theory that can quantitatively predict brush heights
and conditions for maximizing brush height change is still lacking yet is
valuable for the practical design of polymer brushes. Here, we take a
thermodynamic approach to formulate a polymer brush theory to calculate brush
heights at various conditions of graft area, degree of polymerization (DP), and
solvent qualities. Our model consists of two parts-the freely-jointed chain
model to describe the elasticity of brushes and the Flory-Rehner model to
describe the mixing of brushes and solvents. The calculated brush heights at
both dry and wet states fairly agree with the experimental data from the
literature. The calculated brush heights are further used to determine the
conditions for the maximum brush height change. Our theory can guide the design
of polymer brushes for optimal functional performance in various applications
and also can couple with other models to describe more complex behaviors of
polymer brushes.

Thermodynamic properties and phase diagrams are obtained by cluster mean field

the melting process of the SS phase to normal fluid (NF), which can occur in at
least two steps due to the presence of two competing orders in the SS. A
tetra-critical point exists at finite temperature and exhibits intriguing
behavior, which is analyzed for different regimes of interactions. The phase

turn. In Papers 1 and 2 the pressure is axially directed, while it is azimuthal
in Paper 3. In present Paper 4, a radially directed pressure is considered.
Since a generic differential equation, split into three parts, emerges from the
field equations, three different classes of solutions can be considered. Two
could only be partially integrated. The other one, that is fully integrated,
yields a set of solutions with negative pressure. Physical processes where a
negative pressure is encountered are depicted and give a rather solid
foundation to this class of solutions. Moreover, these fully integrated
solutions satisfy the axisymmetry condition while they do not verify the

diverge on the axis, this feature must be considered as reporting a mere
coordinate singularity. Finally, the matching of these solutions to an exterior
appropriate vacuum enforce other constraints on the two constant parameters

axiom, also known as expansion consistency, stating that any alternative chosen
from each of two menus must be chosen from the union of the menus. Expansion
consistency can also be formulated in the setting of social choice. In voting
theory, it states that any candidate chosen from two fields of candidates must
be chosen from the combined field of candidates. An important special case of
the axiom is binary expansion consistency, which states that any candidate
chosen from an initial field of candidates and chosen in a head-to-head match
with a new candidate must also be chosen when the new candidate is added to the
field, thereby ruling out spoiler effects. In this paper, we study the tension
between this weakening of expansion consistency and weakenings of resoluteness,
an axiom demanding the choice of a single candidate in any election. As is well
known, resoluteness is inconsistent with basic fairness conditions on social
choice, namely anonymity and neutrality. Here we prove that even significant
weakenings of resoluteness, which are consistent with anonymity and neutrality,
are inconsistent with binary expansion consistency. The proofs make use of SAT
solving, with the correctness of a SAT encoding formally verified in the Lean
Theorem Prover, as well as a strategy for generalizing impossibility theorems
obtained for special types of voting methods (namely majoritarian and pairwise

wall-attached eddies, whose statistical features are predicted through
Townsend's attached eddy hypothesis (AEH), and very-large-scale motions
(VLSMs), which are not encompassed in the AEH. Furthermore, it has been shown
that the presence of wall-attached eddies within the logarithmic layer is
linked to the appearance of an inverse-power-law region in the streamwise
velocity energy spectra, upon significant separation between outer and viscous
scales. In this work, a near-neutral atmospheric surface layer (ASL) is probed
with a wind LiDAR to investigate the contributions to the streamwise velocity
energy associated with wall-attached and VLSMs for a very-high Reynolds-number
boundary layer. Energy and linear coherence spectra (LCS) of the streamwise
velocity are interrogated to identify the spectral boundaries associated with
eddies of different typologies and the maximum height attained by wall-attached
eddies. Inspired by the AEH, an analytical model for the LCS associated with
wall-attached eddies is formulated. The experimental results show that the
identification of the wall-attached-eddy energy contribution through the
analysis of the energy spectra leads to an underestimate of the associated
spectral range, maximum height attained, and turbulence intensity. This feature
is due to the overlap of the energy associated with VLSMs obscuring the
inverse-power-law region. On the other hand, the Townsend-Perry constant for
the turbulence intensity seems to be properly estimated through the spectral

prominent proposed applications for near-term quantum computing. Here we study
the ability of QAOA to solve hard constraint satisfaction problems, as opposed
to optimization problems. We focus on the fundamental boolean satisfiability
problem, in the form of random $k$-SAT. We develop analytic bounds on the
average success probability of QAOA over random boolean formulae at the
satisfiability threshold, as the number of variables $n$ goes to infinity. The
bounds hold for fixed parameters and when $k$ is a power of 2. We complement
these theoretical results with numerical results on the performance of QAOA for
small $n$, showing that these match the limiting theoretical bounds closely. We
then use these results to compare QAOA with leading classical solvers. In the
case of random 8-SAT, we find that for around 14 ansatz layers, QAOA matches
the scaling performance of the highest-performance classical solver we tested,
WalkSATlm. For larger numbers of layers, QAOA outperforms WalkSATlm, with an
ultimate level of advantage that is still to be determined. Our methods provide
a framework for analysing the performance of QAOA for hard constraint
satisfaction problems and finding further speedups over classical algorithms.

portion of the hamiltonian which describes the interaction between magnons and
the stationary field of nonmagnetic ions. Upon averaging over all possible
distributions of impurities, we express the free energy of the system as a
function of the mean impurity concentration. Subsequently, we set up the
double-time single particle Green function at temperature T in the momentum
space in terms of magnon operators and derive the equation of motion for the
Green function through the Heisenberg equation of motion and then solve the
resulting equation. From this, we calculate the self-energy and then the
spectral density for the system. We apply the formalism to the case of the
simple cubic lattice and compute the density of states, the spectral density
function and the lifetime of the magnons as a function of energy for several
values of the mean concentration of nonmagnetic ions in the lattice. We
calculate magnon energy spectrum as a function of average impurity
concentration fraction c, which shows that for low lying states, the excitation
energy increases continuously with c in the studied range 0.1 < c < 0.7. We use
the spectral density function to compute some thermal quantities. We have
obtained closed form expressions for the configurationally averaged physical
quantities of interest in a unified fashion as functions of c to any order of c

demanding error threshold and resource overhead. If the operations can maintain
high noise bias -- dominated by dephasing error with small bit-flip error -- we
can achieve hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation with a more

multi-level systems (such as harmonic oscillators) can achieve a desirable set
of bias-preserving quantum operations while using continuous engineered

For example, cat codes stabilized with driven-dissipation or Kerr nonlinearity
can possess a set of biased-preserving gates while continuously correcting
bosonic dephasing error. However, cat codes are not compatible with continuous
quantum error correction against excitation loss error, because it is
challenging to continuously monitor the parity to correct photon loss errors.
In this work, we generalize the bias-preserving operations to pair-cat codes,
which can be regarded as a multimode generalization of cat codes, to be
compatible with continuous quantum error correction against both bosonic loss

noise gradients) flow through the network during weight updates. This may lead
to overfitting. In this work, inspired by biological lateral inhibition, we
propose Gradient Mask, which effectively filters out noise gradients in the
process of backpropagation. This allows the learned feature information to be
more intensively stored in the network while filtering out noisy or unimportant
features. Furthermore, we demonstrate analytically how lateral inhibition in
artificial neural networks improves the quality of propagated gradients. A new
criterion for gradient quality is proposed which can be used as a measure
during training of various convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Finally, we
conduct several different experiments to study how Gradient Mask improves the
performance of the network both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Quantitatively, accuracy in the original CNN architecture, accuracy after
pruning, and accuracy after adversarial attacks have shown improvements.
Qualitatively, the CNN trained using Gradient Mask has developed saliency maps
that focus primarily on the object of interest, which is useful for data

catastrophic forgetting or interference of newly acquired knowledge with
knowledge from previous tasks. Recent work has investigated forward knowledge
transfer to new tasks. Backward transfer for improving knowledge gained during
previous tasks has received much less attention. There is in general limited
understanding of how knowledge transfer could aid tasks learned continually. We
present a theory for knowledge transfer in continual supervised learning, which
considers both forward and backward transfer. We aim at understanding their
impact for increasingly knowledgeable learners. We derive error bounds for each
of these transfer mechanisms. These bounds are agnostic to specific
implementations (e.g. deep neural networks). We demonstrate that, for a
continual learner that observes related tasks, both forward and backward
transfer can contribute to an increasing performance as more tasks are
observed.

extension of Tao's slice rank polynomial method, to tensors that are not
diagonal. This is accomplished by generalizing Naslund's distinctness indicator
to what we call a partition indicator. The advantages of partition indicators
are two-fold: they diagonalize tensors that are constant when specified sets of
variables are equal, and even in more general settings they can often
substantially reduce the partition rank as compared to when a distinctness
indicator is applied. The key to our discoveries is integrating the partition
rank method with M\""{o}bius inversion on the lattice of partitions of a finite
set. Through this we unify disparate applications of the partition rank method
in the literature. We then use our theory to address a finite field analogue of
a question of Erd\H{o}s, generalize work of Pach et. al on bounding sizes of
sets avoiding right triangles to bounding sizes of sets avoiding right
$k$-configurations, and complement work of Sauermann and Tao to determine lower
bounds on sizes of sets in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ that must have solutions to a
homogeneous linear equation where many but not all variables are equal.

of Freedom) camera pose of a query image captured in a known scene, which is a
key building block of many computer vision and robotics applications. Recent
advances in structure-based localization solve this problem by memorizing the
mapping from image pixels to scene coordinates with neural networks to build
2D-3D correspondences for camera pose optimization. However, such memorization
requires training by amounts of posed images in each scene, which is heavy and
inefficient. On the contrary, few-shot images are usually sufficient to cover
the main regions of a scene for a human operator to perform visual
localization. In this paper, we propose a scene region classification approach
to achieve fast and effective scene memorization with few-shot images. Our
insight is leveraging a) pre-learned feature extractor, b) scene region
classifier, and c) meta-learning strategy to accelerate training while
mitigating overfitting. We evaluate our method on both indoor and outdoor
benchmarks. The experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in the
few-shot setting, and the training time is significantly reduced to only a few

advantageous over c-orders for structure learning. This is because r-orders are
the minimizers of an appropriately defined optimization problem that could be
either solved exactly (using a reinforcement learning approach) or
approximately (using a hill-climbing search). Moreover, the r-orders (unlike
c-orders) are invariant among all the graphs in a MEC and include c-orders as a
subset. Given that set of r-orders is often significantly larger than the set
of c-orders, it is easier for the optimization problem to find an r-order
instead of a c-order. We evaluate the performance and the scalability of our

1363 galaxies from the SAMI galaxy survey is related to their stellar mass and
a proxy for the gravitational potential, $\Phi$ = log10(M/M*) -
log10($r_e$/kpc). In agreement with previous studies, we find that passive and
star-forming galaxies occupy different areas of the [Z/H]-M* plane, with
passive galaxies having higher [Z/H] than star-forming galaxies at fixed mass
(a difference of 0.23 dex at log10(M/M*)=10.3). We show for the first time that
all galaxies lie on the same relation between [Z/H] and $\Phi$, and show that
the offset in [Z/H] between passive and star-forming galaxies at fixed $\Phi$
is smaller than or equal to the offset in [Z/H] at fixed mass (an average
$\Delta$[Z/H] of 0.11 dex at fixed $\Phi$ compared to 0.21 dex at fixed mass).
We then build a simple model of galaxy evolution to explain and understand our
results. By assuming that [Z/H] traces $\Phi$ over cosmic time and that the
probability that a galaxy quenches depends on both its mass and size, we are
able to reproduce these offsets in stellar metallicity with a model containing
instantaneous quenching. We therefore conclude that an offset in metallicity at
fixed mass cannot by itself be used as evidence of slow quenching processes, in
contrast to previous studies. Instead, our model implies that metal-rich
galaxies have always been the smallest objects for their mass in a population.
Our findings reiterate the need to consider galaxy size when studying stellar
populations.

to the next, is a natural strategy for solving time-dependent differential
equations on classical computers, as well as for solving the Hamiltonian
simulation problem on quantum computers. For more general linear differential
equations, a time-marching based quantum solver can suffer from exponentially
vanishing success probability with respect to the number of time steps and is
thus considered impractical. We solve this problem by repeatedly invoking a
technique called the uniform singular value amplification, and the overall
success probability can be lower bounded by a quantity that is independent of
the number of time steps. The success probability can be further improved using
a compression gadget lemma. This provides a path of designing quantum
differential equation solvers that is alternative to those based on quantum
linear systems algorithms (QLSA). We demonstrate the performance of the
time-marching strategy with a high-order integrator based on the truncated
Dyson series. The complexity of the algorithm depends linearly on the
amplification ratio, which quantifies the deviation from a unitary dynamics. We
prove that the linear dependence on the amplification ratio attains the query
complexity lower bound and thus cannot be improved in the worst case. This
algorithm also surpasses existing QLSA based solvers in three aspects: (1) the
coefficient matrix $A(t)$ does not need to be diagonalizable. (2) $A(t)$ can be
non-smooth, and is only of bounded variation. (3) It can use fewer queries to
the initial state. Finally, we demonstrate the time-marching strategy with a
first-order truncated Magnus series, while retaining the aforementioned
benefits. Our analysis also raises some open questions concerning the
differences between time-marching and QLSA based methods for solving
differential equations.

target (e.g., the position of the vehicle in front) based on features (e.g.,
video frames) observed at a sensing node (e.g., camera or lidar). One might
expect that the performance of real-time supervised learning degrades
monotonically as the feature becomes stale. Using an information-theoretic
analysis, we show that this is true if the feature and target data sequence can
be closely approximated as a Markov chain; it is not true if the data sequence
is far from Markovian. Hence, the prediction error of real-time supervised
learning is a function of the Age of Information (AoI), where the function
could be non-monotonic. Several experiments are conducted to illustrate the
monotonic and non-monotonic behaviors of the prediction error. To minimize the
inference error in real-time, we propose a new ""selection-from-buffer"" model
for sending the features, which is more general than the ""generate-at-will""
model used in earlier studies. By using Gittins and Whittle indices,
low-complexity scheduling strategies are developed to minimize the inference
error, where a new connection between the Gittins index theory and Age of
Information (AoI) minimization is discovered. These scheduling results hold (i)
for minimizing general AoI functions (monotonic or non-monotonic) and (ii) for

  Multi-dimensional Topological Hierarchies",,,,,"cs.GR cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the response of an output variable to multi-dimensional inputs
lies at the heart of many data exploration endeavours. Topology-based methods,
in particular Morse theory and persistent homology, provide a useful framework
for studying this relationship, as phenomena of interest often appear naturally
as fundamental features. The Morse-Smale complex captures a wide range of
features by partitioning the domain of a scalar function into piecewise
monotonic regions, while persistent homology provides a means to study these
features at different scales of simplification. Previous works demonstrated how
to compute such a representation and its usefulness to gain insight into
multi-dimensional data. However, exploration of the multi-scale nature of the
data was limited to selecting a single simplification threshold from a plot of
region count. In this paper, we present a novel tree visualization that
provides a concise overview of the entire hierarchy of topological features.
The structure of the tree provides initial insights in terms of the
distribution, size, and stability of all partitions. We use regression analysis
to fit linear models in each partition, and develop local and relative measures
to further assess uniqueness and the importance of each partition, especially
with respect parents/children in the feature hierarchy. The expressiveness of
the tree visualization becomes apparent when we encode such measures using
colors, and the layout allows an unprecedented level of control over feature
selection during exploration. For instance, selecting features from multiple
scales of the hierarchy enables a more nuanced exploration. Finally, we
demonstrate our approach using examples from several scientific domains.

components in $A^t$ that forms a group under componentwise addition in $A^t$,
for each $t\in\mathbf{Z}$. As shown previously, any strongly controllable
complete group system $A$ can be decomposed into generators. We study
permutations of the generators when sequences in the group system are
multiplied. We show that any strongly controllable complete group system $A$ is
isomorphic to a generator group $({\mathcal{U}},\circ)$. The set
${\mathcal{U}}$ is a set of tensors, a double Cartesian product space of sets
$G_k^t$, with indices $k$, for $0\le k\le\ell$, and time $t$, for
$t\in\mathbf{Z}$. $G_k^t$ is a set of unique generator labels for the
generators in $A$ with nontrivial span for the time interval $[t,t+k]$. We show
the generator group contains a unique elementary system, an infinite collection
of elementary groups, one for each $k$ and $t$, defined on small subsets of
${\mathcal{U}}$, in the shape of triangles, which form a tile like structure
over ${\mathcal{U}}$. There is a homomorphism from each elementary group to any
elementary group defined on smaller tiles of the former group. The group system
$A$ may be constructed from either the generator group or elementary system.
These results have application to linear block codes, any algebraic system that
contains a linear block code, group shifts, and harmonic theory in mathematics,
and systems theory, coding theory, control theory, and related fields in

representation learning, and the key component of contrastive learning lies in
the construction of positive and negative samples. Previous methods usually
utilize the proximity of nodes in the graph as the principle. Recently, the
data augmentation based contrastive learning method has advanced to show great
power in the visual domain, and some works extended this method from images to
graphs. However, unlike the data augmentation on images, the data augmentation
on graphs is far less intuitive and much harder to provide high-quality
contrastive samples, which leaves much space for improvement. In this work, by
introducing an adversarial graph view for data augmentation, we propose a
simple but effective method, Adversarial Graph Contrastive Learning (ARIEL), to
extract informative contrastive samples within reasonable constraints. We
develop a new technique called information regularization for stable training
and use subgraph sampling for scalability. We generalize our method from
node-level contrastive learning to the graph-level by treating each graph
instance as a supernode. ARIEL consistently outperforms the current graph
contrastive learning methods for both node-level and graph-level classification
tasks on real-world datasets. We further demonstrate that ARIEL is more robust

The argument is based on different short range interactions for these
tetraquark states coming from the color-color and color-spin interaction in a
quark model, and the presence of a common strong D-wave mixing at larger
distance similar to the deuteron case, which for the molecular configurations
lead to large sizes. Such an analogy at large distance allows us to calculate
the transverse momentum dependence of the loosely bound molecular configuration
of tetraquarks produced in heavy ion collisions using the coalescence model

is, removing the opportunity to franchise tag players for multiple years, and
adding an option for the player to either test free agency but receive zero pay

  for Open Set Social Event Detection",,,,,"cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  State-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous
success in social event detection tasks when restricted to a closed set of
events. However, considering the large amount of data needed for training a
neural network and the limited ability of a neural network in handling
previously unknown data, it remains a challenge for existing GNN-based methods
to operate in an open set setting. To address this problem, we design a
Quality-aware Self-improving Graph Neural Network (QSGNN) which extends the
knowledge from known to unknown by leveraging the best of known samples and
reliable knowledge transfer. Specifically, to fully exploit the labeled data,
we propose a novel supervised pairwise loss with an additional orthogonal
inter-class relation constraint to train the backbone GNN encoder. The learnt,
already-known events further serve as strong reference bases for the unknown
ones, which greatly prompts knowledge acquisition and transfer. When the model
is generalized to unknown data, to ensure the effectiveness and reliability, we
further leverage the reference similarity distribution vectors for pseudo
pairwise label generation, selection and quality assessment. Following the
diversity principle of active learning, our method selects diverse pair samples
with the generated pseudo labels to fine-tune the GNN encoder. Besides, we
propose a novel quality-guided optimization in which the contributions of
pseudo labels are weighted based on consistency. We thoroughly evaluate our
model on two large real-world social event datasets. Experiments demonstrate
that our model achieves state-of-the-art results and extends well to unknown
events.

paper, we aim to address the challenge of label sparsity in semantic

annotations. To this end, we first propose a teacher-student learning paradigm
for generating dense pseudo-labels and then develop two novel strategies for
denoising pseudo-labels. In particular, we use spatial priors around the sparse
annotations to suppress the noisy pseudo-labels. In addition, we introduce a
loss-driven dynamic label selection strategy for label denoising. We
instantiate our paradigm with two variants of learning strategies: a single
offline teacher setting, and mutual online teachers setting. Our approach
achieves notable improvements on three challenging benchmarks for semantic

assigning connected nodes as different colors as possible. However, we observe
that state-of-the-art GNNs are less successful in the graph coloring problem.
We analyze the reasons from two perspectives. First, most GNNs fail to
generalize the task under homophily to heterophily, i.e., graphs where
connected nodes are assigned different colors. Second, GNNs are bounded by the
network depth, making them possible to be a local method, which has been
demonstrated to be non-optimal in Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. In
this paper, we focus on the aggregation-combine GNNs (AC-GNNs), a popular class
of GNNs. We first define the power of AC-GNNs in the coloring problem as the
capability to assign nodes different colors. The definition is different with
previous one that is based on the assumption of homophily. We identify node
pairs that AC-GNNs fail to discriminate. Furthermore, we show that any AC-GNN
is a local coloring method, and any local coloring method is non-optimal by
exploring the limits of local methods over sparse random graphs, thereby
demonstrating the non-optimality of AC-GNNs due to its local property. We then
prove the positive correlation between model depth and its coloring power.
Moreover, we discuss the color equivariance of graphs to tackle some practical
constraints such as the pre-fixing constraints. Following the discussions
above, we summarize a series of rules a series of rules that make a GNN color
equivariant and powerful in the coloring problem. Then, we propose a simple
AC-GNN variation satisfying these rules. We empirically validate our
theoretical findings and demonstrate that our simple model substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms in both quality and runtime.

estimation, is a fundamental task for a wide range of intelligent
transportation applications, such as navigation, route planning, and
ride-hailing services. To accurately predict the travel time of a route, it is
essential to take into account both contextual and predictive factors, such as
spatial-temporal interaction, driving behavior, and traffic congestion
propagation inference. The ETA prediction models previously deployed at Baidu
Maps have addressed the factors of spatial-temporal interaction (ConSTGAT) and
driving behavior (SSML). In this work, we focus on modeling traffic congestion
propagation patterns to improve ETA performance. Traffic congestion propagation
pattern modeling is challenging, and it requires accounting for impact regions
over time and cumulative effect of delay variations over time caused by traffic
events on the road network. In this paper, we present a practical
industrial-grade ETA prediction framework named DuETA. Specifically, we
construct a congestion-sensitive graph based on the correlations of traffic
patterns, and we develop a route-aware graph transformer to directly learn the
long-distance correlations of the road segments. This design enables DuETA to
capture the interactions between the road segment pairs that are spatially
distant but highly correlated with traffic conditions. Extensive experiments
are conducted on large-scale, real-world datasets collected from Baidu Maps.
Experimental results show that ETA prediction can significantly benefit from
the learned traffic congestion propagation patterns. In addition, DuETA has
already been deployed in production at Baidu Maps, serving billions of requests
every day. This demonstrates that DuETA is an industrial-grade and robust
solution for large-scale ETA prediction services.

scenarios. Recent studies show that well-designed adversarial defense
strategies can improve the robustness of deep learning models against

technologies, it also tends to be more difficult to evaluate the robustness of
the defensed model due to the weak performance of existing manually designed
adversarial attacks. To address the challenge, given the defensed model, the
efficient adversarial attack with less computational burden and lower robust
accuracy is needed to be further exploited. Therefore, we propose a
multi-objective memetic algorithm for auto adversarial attack optimization
design, which realizes the automatical search for the near-optimal adversarial
attack towards defensed models. Firstly, the more general mathematical model of
auto adversarial attack optimization design is constructed, where the search
space includes not only the attacker operations, magnitude, iteration number,

attacks. In addition, we develop a multi-objective memetic algorithm combining

decrease the evaluation cost during the search, we propose a representative

shift benchmarks. There are two main questions that must be addressed to
understand when, if ever, we should use each method. First, how does each ad

And, second, when does learning invariant representations actually yield robust
models? To address these issues, we introduce a broad formal notion of what it
means for a real-world domain shift to admit invariant structure. Then, we
characterize the causal structures that are compatible with this notion of
invariance.With this in hand, we find conditions under which method-specific
invariance notions correspond to real-world invariant structure, and we clarify

can be utilized without greenhouse gas emissions through the production of
molecular hydrogen and solid carbon via methane pyrolysis. In the absence of a
carbon tax, methane pyrolysis is not economically competitive with current
hydrogen production methods unless the carbon byproducts can be valorized. In
this work, we assess the viability of the carbon byproduct produced from
methane pyrolysis in molten salts as high-value-added anode or conductive
additive for secondary Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. Raman characterization and
electrochemical differential capacity analysis demonstrate that the use of
molten salt mixtures with catalytically-active FeCl3- or MnCl2 result in more
graphitic carbon co-products. These graphitic carbons exhibit the best
electrochemical performance (up to 272 mAh/g of reversible capacity) when used
as Li-ion anodes. For all carbon samples studied here, disordered carbon
domains and retained salt species trapped and/or intercalated into the carbon
structure were identified by X-ray photoelectron and multinuclear solid-state
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The latter lead to reduced
electrochemical activity and reversibility, and poorer rate performance
compared to commercial carbon anodes. The electronic conductivity of the
pyrolyzed carbons is found to be highly dependent on their purity, with the
purest carbon exhibiting an electronic conductivity nearly on par with that of
commercial carbon additives. These findings suggest that more effective removal
of the salt catalyst could enable applications of these carbons in secondary
batteries, providing a financial incentive for the large-scale implementation
of methane pyrolysis for low-carbon hydrogen production.

we explain some experimental results of variational autoencoders, denoising

control Hamiltonians that efficiently produce desired target states. As such,
it plays an essential role in the successful design and development of quantum
technologies. However, often the delivered control pulses are exceedingly
sensitive to small perturbations, which can make it hard if not impossible to
reliably deploy these in experiments. Robust quantum control aims at mitigating
this issue by finding control pulses that uphold their capacity to reproduce
the target states even in the presence of pulse perturbations. However, finding
such robust control pulses is generically hard, since the assessment of control
pulses requires the inclusion of all possible distorted versions in the
evaluation. Here we show that robust control pulses can be identified based on
disorder-dressed evolution equations. The latter capture the effect of
disorder, which here stands for the pulse perturbations, in terms of quantum
master equations describing the evolution of the disorder-averaged density
matrix. In this approach to robust control, the purities of the final states
indicate the robustness of the underlying control pulses, and robust control
pulses are singled out if the final states are pure (and coincide with the
target states). We show that this principle can be successfully employed to
find robust control pulses. To this end, we adapt Krotov's method for
disorder-dressed evolution and demonstrate its application with several

surfaces and establish a low-distortion mapping between them with the feature
correspondence encoded as landmark constraints. Prior registration works have
primarily focused on using manually labeled landmarks and solving highly
nonlinear optimization problems, which are time-consuming and hence hinder
practical applications. In this work, we propose a novel framework for the

quasi-conformal geometry and convolutional neural networks. We first develop a
landmark detection network (LD-Net) that allows for the automatic extraction of
landmark curves given two prescribed starting and ending points based on the
surface geometry. We then utilize the detected landmarks and quasi-conformal
theory for achieving the surface registration. Specifically, we develop a
coefficient prediction network (CP-Net) for predicting the Beltrami
coefficients associated with the desired landmark-based registration and a
mapping network called the disk Beltrami solver network (DBS-Net) for
generating quasi-conformal mappings from the predicted Beltrami coefficients,
with the bijectivity guaranteed by quasi-conformal theory. Experimental results

  Censoring for Survival Analysis",,,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern epidemiological and clinical studies aim at analyzing a time-to-event
endpoint. A common complication is right censoring. In some cases, it arises
because subjects are still surviving after the study terminates or move out of
the study area, in which case right censoring is typically treated as
independent or non-informative. Such an assumption can be further relaxed to
conditional independent censoring by leveraging possibly time-varying covariate
information, if available, assuming censoring and failure time are independent
among covariate strata. In yet other instances, events may be censored by other
competing events like death and are associated with censoring possibly through
prognosis. Realistically, measured covariates can rarely capture all such
association with certainty. For such dependent censoring, often covariate
measurements are at best proxies of underlying prognosis. In this paper, we
establish a nonparametric identification framework by formally accounting for
the covariate measurements as imperfect proxies of underlying association. The
framework suggests adaptive estimators which we give generic assumptions under
which they are consistent, asymptotically normal and doubly robust. We consider
a concrete setting to illustrate our framework, where we examine the
finite-sample performance of our proposed estimators via extensive simulations.

mean squared displacement can be determined separately. It is shown that the
diffusional part is not directly correlated with the concentration of

of atoms indicates that in a-Si a well-defined elemental diffusion length does
not exist, in contrast to SD in the crystalline Si. The analysis of atoms with
large squared displacements reveals that the mechanisms of SD in a-Si are
characterized by complex rearrangements of bonds or exchange of neighbors.
These are mono- and bi-directional exchanges of neighbors and neighbor
replacements. Exchanges or replacements may concern up to three neighbors and
may occur in relatively short periods of some ps. Bi- or mono-directional
exchange or replacement of one neighbor atom happen more frequently than
processes including more neighbors. A comparison of results for the two

Linear-Quadratic optimal control by focusing on the Hilbert space of controlled
trajectories, allowing for a convenient handling of state constraints and
meeting points. We now extend this viewpoint to estimation problems where it is
known that kernels are the covariances of stochastic processes. Here, the
Markovian Gaussian processes stem from the linear stochastic differential
equations describing the continuous-time dynamics and observations. Taking
extensive care to require minimal invertibility requirements on the operators,
we give novel explicit formulas for these covariances. We also determine their
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, stressing the symmetries between a space of
forward-time trajectories and a space of backward-time information vectors. The
two spaces play an analogue role for filtering to Sobolev spaces in variational
analysis, and allow to recover the Kalman estimate through a direct variational

ubiquitous feature in the formation of cosmic large-scale structure. This
separation, termed dissociation, is prominent in galaxy clusters that formed
through collisions of massive progenitors, such as the famous `Bullet' cluster.
A direct comparison of the incidence of such dissociated structures with
theoretical predictions is challenged by the rarity of strongly dissociated
systems and the difficulty to quantify dissociation. This paper introduces a
well-defined dimensionless dissociation index $S\in[-1,1]$ that encodes the
quadrupole difference between DM and gas in a custom region. Using a simulation
of cosmic large-scale structure with cold DM and ideal non-radiating gas, in
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we find that 90 per cent of the haloes are positively
dissociated ($S>0$), meaning their DM is more elongated than their gas. The
spatial density of highly dissociated massive structures appears consistent
with observations. Through idealised $N$-body+SPH simulations of colliding
gaseous DM haloes, we further explore the details of how ram-pressure causes
dissociation in binary collisions. A suite of 300 such simulations reveals a
scale-free relation between the orbital parameters of binary collisions and the
resulting dissociation. Building on this relation, we conclude that the
frequency of dissociated structures in non-radiative cosmological simulations
is nearly fully accounted for by the major (mass ratio $>1:10$) binary
collisions predicted by such simulations. In principle, our results allow us to
constrain the orbital parameters that produced specific observed dissociated
clusters.

their collective plasmon resonances. This collective optical response results
in enhanced light-matter interactions, which can be exploited in various
applications. Here, we demonstrate their application in sensing volatile
organic compounds, using methanol as a test-case. Ordered films over several
cm2 were obtained by interfacial self-assembly of colloidal Au nanoparticles
(~10 nm diameter) through controlled evaporation of the solvent. Even though
isolated nanoparticles of this size are inherently non-scattering, when
arranged in a close-packed film the plasmonic coupling results in a strong
reflectance and absorbance. The in-situ tracking of vapor phase methanol
concentration through UV-Vis transmission measurements of the nanoparticle film
is first demonstrated. Next, in-situ ellipsometry of the self-assembled films
in the Kretschmann (also known as ATR) configuration is shown to yield enhanced
sensitivity, especially with phase difference measurements. Our study shows the
excellent agreement between theoretical models of the spectral response of
self-assembled films with experimental in-situ sensing experiments. At the same
time, the theoretical framework provides the basis for the interpretation of
the various observed experimental trends. Combining periodic nanoparticle films
with ellipsometry in the Kretschmann configuration is a promising strategy
towards highly sensitive and selective plasmonic thin-film devices based on
colloidal fabrication methods for volatile organic compound (VOC) sensing
applications.

existing methods for adapting robot trajectory or impedance according to

  To improve generality, this paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC)
framework which plans both trajectory and impedance online, can consider
discrete and continuous uncertainties, includes safety constraints, and can be
efficiently applied to a new task. This framework can consider uncertainty
from: contact constraint variation, uncertainty in human goals, or task
disturbances. An uncertainty-aware task model is learned from a few ($\leq3$)
demonstrations using Gaussian Processes. This task model is used in a nonlinear
MPC problem to optimize robot trajectory and impedance according to belief in
discrete human goals, human kinematics, safety constraints, contact stability,

analyzed with respect to convexity, and validated in co-manipulation with
multiple goals, a collaborative polishing task, and a collaborative assembly

the SDW state is enhanced. At finite doping, the SSH phonon is found to favor
sSC at $U=0$. With increasing positive $U$, we find d-wave superconductivity
(dSC) and incommensurate SDW states. In a narrow window of moderate $U$ and

session-processes to explore the full expressive power of the pi-calculus where
the mixed choices are proved more expressive than the (non-mixed) guarded

proposed the binary session types with mixed choices (CMV+). This paper carries
a surprising, unfortunate result on CMV+: in spite of an inclusion of
unrestricted channels with mixed choice, CMV+'s mixed choice is rather separate

either the leader election problem or a synchronisation pattern as
distinguishing feature), showing that there exists no good encoding from the

soundness and thereby that the encoding is good up to coupled similarity. This

providing isolation in radio access network (RAN) is cumbersome. In this

product sets in space $\otimes_{i=1}^{n}\mathcal{C}^{d_{i}}$ ($n,d_{i}\geq 3$)
and show that there do exist incomplete orthogonal product bases that can be
strongly nonlocal in any possible $n$-partite systems for all even $n$. Our
newly constructed orthogonal product sets are asymmetric. We analyze the
differences and connections between these sets and the known orthogonal product
sets in odd party systems.
  In addition, we present a local state discrimination protocol for our sets by
using additional entangled resource. When at least two subsystems have
dimensions greater than three, the protocol consumes less entanglement than
teleportation-based protocol. Strongly nonlocal set implies that the
information cannot be completely accessed as long as it does not happen that
all parties are together. As an application, we connect our sets with local
information hiding in multipartite system.

on an optimal structure of the coefficient diagram method (CDM) in a two-area

to governor dead band (GDB) and generation rate constraint (GRC) have been
considered. In this article, a hybrid CDM method is combined with the
optimization of its mathematical equations to achieve an innovative controller.
Furthermore, a new metaheuristic optimization technique called the water cycle
algorithm (WCA) is used to determine the optimal coefficients of the CDM
controller. For the purpose of demonstrating the validity of the proposed
scheme, a wide range of uncertainties in the dynamic parameters of a nonlinear
power system were tested. In addition, a comparative study is presented between
the results obtained from a classical integral, CDM alone, optimized Fuzzy,
optimized PID, and the suggested controller. In this new approach to improved
control, algebraic support provides a robust and responsive controller that can
provide fast and stable dynamic responses and effectively overcome the
detrimental effects of nonlinearities and uncertainties in the parameters of
the power system.

pre-trained a 2D photorealistic style transfer network, which can meet the

several drawbacks, including architecture centralisation, policy tampering,
access rights validation, malicious third-party policy assignment and control,
and network-related overheads. The increasing trend of integrating Blockchain
technology with IoT networks demonstrates its importance and potential to
address the shortcomings of traditional IoT network authorisation mechanisms.
This paper proposes a decentralised, secure, dynamic, and flexible
authorisation scheme for IoT networks based on attribute-based access control
(ABAC) fine-grained policies stored on a distributed immutable ledger. We
design a Blockchain-based ABAC policy management framework divided into
Attribute Management Authority (AMA) and Policy Management Authority (PMA)
frameworks that use smart contract features to initialise, store, and manage
attributes and policies on the Blockchain. To achieve flexibility and
dynamicity in the authorisation process, we capture and utilise the
environmental-related attributes in conjunction with the subject and object
attributes of the ABAC model to define the policies. Furthermore, we designed
the Blockchain-based Access Management Framework (AMF) to manage user requests
to access IoT devices while maintaining the privacy and auditability of user
requests and assigned policies. We implemented a prototype of our proposed
scheme and executed it on the local Ethereum Blockchain. Finally, we
demonstrated the applicability and flexibility of our proposed scheme for an
IoT-based smart home scenario, taking into account deployment, execution and

present a detailed study on the timing and spectral properties of the
transitions of type-B QPOs in MAXI~J1348--630, observed by \emph{Insight}-HXMT.
The fractional rms variability--energy relationship and energy spectra reveal
that type-B QPOs probably originate from jet precession. Compared to weak
power-law dominated power spectrum, when type-B QPO is present, the
corresponding energy spectrum shows an increase in Comptonization component and
the need for {\tt\string xillverCp} component, and a slight increase of height
of the corona when using {\tt\string relxilllp} model. Therefore, we suggest
that a coupled inner disk-jet region is responsible for the observed type-B
QPOs transitions. The time scale for the appearance/disappearance of type-B
QPOs is either long or short (seconds), which may indicate an instability of
disk-jet structure. For these phenomena, we give the hypothesis that the
Bardeen-Petterson effect causes disk-jet structure to align with BH spin axis,
or that the disappearance of small-scale jets bound by the magnetic flux tubes
lead to the disappearance of type-B QPOs. We observed three events regarding
the B/C transitions, one of which occurred in a short time from $\sim 9.2$ Hz
(C) to $\sim 4.8$ Hz (B). The energy spectral analysis for the other two
transitions shows that when type-C QPO is present, the Comptonization flux is
higher, the spectrum is harder and the inner radius of disk changes
insignificantly. We suggest that type-C QPOs probably originate from relatively
stronger jets or corona.

Mechanisms for such improvement were widely proposed, including wettability
alteration and reduction in the oil-brine interfacial tension (IFT), although
their synergistic contributions were vaguely clarified. Crude oil displacement
by spontaneous imbibition was conducted in the current research with focus on
the effects of brine valency and concentration. Monovalent (NaCl) and divalent
(CaCl2) brines at elevated concentrations were examined. Imbibition results
showed that NaCl brine at suitable concentration (100 mM) displaced greater oil
than too-low or too-high concentrations, and these monovalent brines displaced
more effective than those of divalent CaCl2 due to an oil-wetting as a result
of divalent ion bridging phenomenon. This echoes crucial influences of both
brine valency and concentration. The findings revealed that in a given
imbibition system a required IFT is a wettability-dependent, water-wet system
needs high IFT to enhance a driving capillarity while oil-wet system prefers
lower IFT to weaken a resisting capillary force. Brine formula directly
attributed to wettability and IFT, NaCl brines secure water-wetting with high
IFT while CaCl2 brines reduced IFT more effectively with an assured
oil-wetting. Low-salinity enhanced oil recovery mechanism was thus found to be
contributed from capillary effect, which was an interplay between the
interfacial tension and wettability. Paring these two parameters by formulating
imbibing brine to anticipate high oil recovery is crucial and of challenge.

nonrelativistic many-body systems. They involve time-nonlocal equations of
motion. Momentum, angular momentum, and energy are (nonlocally) defined, whose
total values are conserved for isolated systems. The models make all the
salient MOND predictions. Yet, they differ from existing ""modified-gravity""
formulations in some second-tier predictions. The models describe correctly the
motion of a composite body in a low-acceleration field even when the internal
accelerations of its constituents are high. They exhibit a MOND external field
effect (EFE) that shows some important differences from what we have come to
expect from modified-gravity versions: In one, simple example of the models,
what determines the EFE, in the case of a dominant external field, is
$\mu(\theta\langle a_{ex}\rangle/a_0)$, where $\mu(x)$ is the MOND
`interpolating function' that describes rotation curves, compared with
$\mu(a_{ex}/a_0)$ for presently-known modified-gravity formulations. The two
main differences are that while $a_{ex}$ is the momentary value of the external
acceleration, $\langle a_{ex}\rangle$ is a certain time average of it, and that
$\theta>1$ is an extra factor that depends on the frequency ratio of the
external- and internal-field variations. Only ratios of frequencies enter, and
$a_0$ remains the only new dimensioned constant. For a system on a circular
orbit in a galaxy (such as the vertical dynamics in a disc galaxy), the first
difference disappears, since $\langle a_{ex}\rangle=a_{ex}$. But the $\theta$
factor can appreciably enhance the EFE in quenching MOND effects, over what is
deduced in modified gravity. Some exact solutions are also described, such as
for rotation curves, for an harmonic force, and the general, two-body problem,
which in the deep-MOND regime reduces to a single-body problem.

impacts on various physical platforms and peculiar applications. In
non-Hermitian systems, both eigenvalues and eigenstates simultaneously coalesce
at exceptional points (EPs). As one of the remarkable features of EPs, the
field chirality is commonly considered perfect, which is utilized as an
intriguing feature to control wave propagation and regarded as a criterion of
EP. However, in this work, we discover an imperfect chirality of eigenmodes at
the EPs in an optical whispering gallery mode (WGM) microcavity perturbed by
two strong nanoscatterers. This counterintuitive phenomenon originates from a
strong frequency-dependence of the scattering between the counterpropagating
waves at an ""effective scatterer"", which could be explained by a
first-principle-based model considering a dynamic multiple-scattering process
of the azimuthally propagating modes. We find that the generally imperfect
chirality at the EP tends to be globally perfect with the decrease of the
scattering effect induced by the nanoscatterers. Furthermore, the chirality
also becomes locally perfect with the decrease of the relative azimuthal angle
between the two strong nanoscatterers. This work provides a new understanding
of the general properties of chirality at EPs. It will benefit the potential
applications enabled by the chirality features of non-Hermitian systems at EPs.

estimated strength $r$ maybe wrong due to limited sample size, and nonnormality
of data. In the context of statistical significance testing, erroneous
interpretation of a $p$-value as posterior probability leads to Type I errors
-- a general issue with significance testing that extends to PCC. Such errors
are exacerbated when testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously. To tackle
these issues, we propose a machine-learning-based predictive data calibration
method which essentially conditions the data samples on the expected linear
relationship. Calculating PCC using calibrated data yields a calibrated
$p$-value that can be interpreted as posterior probability together with a
calibrated $r$ estimate, a desired outcome not provided by other methods.
Furthermore, the ensuing independent interpretation of each test might
eliminate the need for multiple testing correction. We provide empirical

comparable with models that are trained using standard 12-lead ECG.
Specifically, we propose a multi-task learning scheme in the form of the number
of heartbeats regression and an effective mechanism to integrate patient
demographic data into the system. With these two advancements, we got
classification performance in terms of F1 scores of 0.9796 and 0.8140 on two
large-scale ECG datasets, i.e., Chapman and CPSC-2018, respectively, which
surpassed current state-of-the-art ECG classification methods, even those
trained on 12-lead data. To encourage further development, our source code is

points have recently gained much attraction, offering an unparalleled high
sensitivity in measuring small perturbations. In the past, most of the
PT-symmetric sensors have been based on tracking the mode-splitting that arises
due to a perturbation-induced change in coupling strength between two
subcavities of the PT-symmetric system. We design a linear fiber Fabry-P\'erot
and coupled cavities sensor, tailored to operate in the broken PT-symmetric
region. We explore a new sensing metric-that is, the mode's linewidth change as
a function of perturbation-induced changes in the loss within one of the
subcavities of the PT-symmetric system. The coupling strength between the two
subcavities remains unchanged in our proposed sensor. Supported by a
mathematical formulation, we find that the full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of
the cavity resonances exhibits a square root dependence on the refractive index
(RI) change in one of the subcavities. The proposed fiber cavity refractive
index sensor has a maximum sensitivity of $2.26\times10^7$ GHz/RIU and a lowest
detection limit of $10^{-9}$ RIU, widely outperforming the comparable cavity
sensors subject to the same refractive index change, gain, and loss settings.

extraction (TSE) has greatly progressed. Most works, however, focus on
relatively well-controlled conditions using, e.g., read speech. The performance
may degrade in more realistic situations. One of the factors causing such
degradation may be intrinsic speaker variability, such as emotions, occurring
commonly in realistic speech. In this paper, we investigate the influence of
emotions on TSE and BSS. We create a new test dataset of emotional mixtures for
the evaluation of TSE and BSS. This dataset combines LibriSpeech and Ryerson
Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS). Through
controlled experiments, we can analyze the impact of different emotions on the
performance of BSS and TSE. We observe that BSS is relatively robust to
emotions, while TSE, which requires identifying and extracting the speech of a
target speaker, is much more sensitive to emotions. On comparative speaker
verification experiments we show that identifying the target speaker may be
particularly challenging when dealing with emotional speech. Using our
findings, we outline potential future directions that could improve the
robustness of BSS and TSE systems toward emotional speech.

coherent vertical breathing motions. At the same time, Milky Way-like galaxies
experience tidal interactions with satellites/companions during their
evolution. While these tidal interactions can excite vertical oscillations, it
is still not clear whether vertical breathing motions are excited
\textit{directly} by the tidal encounters or are driven by the tidally-induced
spirals. We test whether excitation of breathing motions are directly linked to
tidal interactions by constructing a set of $N$-body models (with mass ratio
5:1) of unbound, single fly-by interactions with varying orbital
configurations. We first reproduce the well-known result that such fly-by
interactions can excite strong transient spirals (lasting for $\sim 2.9-4.2$
Gyr) in the outer disc of the host galaxy. The generation and strength of the
spirals are shown to vary with the orbital parameters (the angle of
interaction, and the orbital spin vector). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our
fly-by models exhibit coherent breathing motions whose amplitude increases with
height. The amplitudes of breathing motions show characteristic modulation
along the azimuthal direction, with compressing breathing motions coinciding
with the peaks of the spirals and expanding breathing motions falling in the
inter-arm regions -- a signature of a spiral-driven breathing motion. These
breathing motions in our models end when the strong tidally-induced spiral arms
fade away. Thus, it is the tidally-induced spirals which drive the large-scale
breathing motions in our fly-by models, and the dynamical role of the tidal

coupled to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. We uncover how electric fields affect
low-energy excitations by both analytical and numerical methods. In the
half-filling case, despite electric fields, the system is still a Mott
insulator, just like the Hubbard model. For hole-doped systems, holes are
confined under nonzero electric fields, resulting in a hole-pair bound state.
Furthermore, this bound state also significantly affects the superconductivity,
which manifests itself in the emergence of attractive interactions between bond
singlet Cooper pairs. Specifically, numerical results reveal that the dimension
of the dominant superconducting order parameter becomes smaller when increasing
the electric field, signaling an enhancement of the superconducting instability
induced by lattice fermion confinement. The superconducting order can even be
the dominant order of the system for suitable doping and large applied electric
field. The confinement also induces a $\pi$ momentum for the dominant
superconducting order parameter leading to a quasi-long-range pair density wave
order. Our results provide insights for understanding unconventional

different line of thinking, time series, especially long-term forecasting, may
differ from other fields. It is not necessary to use extensive and complex
models to grasp all aspects of time series, but to use pure models to grasp the
core rules of time series changes. With this simple but effective idea, we
created PureTS, a network with three pure linear layers that achieved
state-of-the-art in 80% of the long sequence prediction tasks while being
nearly the lightest model and having the fastest running speed. On this basis,
we discuss the potential of pure linear layers in both phenomena and essence.
The ability to understand the core law contributes to the high precision of
long-distance prediction, and reasonable fluctuation prevents it from
distorting the curve in multi-step prediction like mainstream deep learning
models, which is summarized as a pure linear neural network that avoids
over-fluctuating. Finally, we suggest the fundamental design standards for
lightweight long-step time series tasks: input and output should try to have

However, its underlying long-tailed distribution of predicate classes is a
challenging problem. For extremely unbalanced predicate distributions, existing
approaches usually construct complicated context encoders to extract the
intrinsic relevance of scene context to predicates and complex networks to
improve the learning ability of network models for highly imbalanced predicate
distributions. To address the unbiased SGG problem, we introduce a simple yet
effective method dubbed Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (CAME) to improve
model diversity and mitigate biased SGG without complicated design.
Specifically, we propose to integrate the mixture of experts with a divide and
ensemble strategy to remedy the severely long-tailed distribution of predicate
classes, which is applicable to the majority of unbiased scene graph
generators. The biased SGG is thereby reduced, and the model tends to
anticipate more evenly distributed predicate predictions. To differentiate
between various predicate distribution levels, experts with the same weights
are not sufficiently diverse. In order to enable the network dynamically
exploit the rich scene context and further boost the diversity of model, we
simply use the built-in module to create a context encoder. The importance of
each expert to scene context and each predicate to each expert is dynamically
associated with expert weighting (EW) and predicate weighting (PW) strategy. We
have conducted extensive experiments on three tasks using the Visual Genome

relies on sound and visual information, which puts a massive burden on online
media. Data compression becomes increasingly important to reduce the volume of
data transmission and storage. To further improve the efficiency of image
compression, researchers utilize various image processing methods to compensate
for the limitations of conventional codecs and advanced learning-based
compression methods. Instead of modifying the image compression oriented
approaches, we propose a unified image compression preprocessing framework,
called Kuchen, which aims to further improve the performance of existing
codecs. The framework consists of a hybrid data labeling system along with a
learning-based backbone to simulate personalized preprocessing. As far as we
know, this is the first exploration of setting a unified preprocessing
benchmark in image compression tasks. Results demonstrate that the modern
codecs optimized by our unified preprocessing framework constantly improve the
efficiency of the state-of-the-art compression.

coded modulation standard for communication systems aiming to operate close to
channel capacity at high transmission rates. The essential component of PAS
that breeds this widespread interest is the amplitude shaping block, through
which the channel input distribution is controlled. This block is responsible
for converting bit strings into amplitude sequences with certain properties,
e.g., fixed composition, limited energy, limited energy variation, etc.
Recently, band-trellis enumerative sphere shaping (B-ESS) was introduced as an
amplitude shaping technique that achieves limited energy variations which is
useful in optical communication scenarios. B-ESS operates based on a trellis
diagram in which sequences with high energy variations are pruned. In this
work, we study the implementation of B-ESS. We first show that thanks to the
trellis structure obtained by this pruning, B-ESS can be implemented with very
low storage complexity. The trellis computation is shown to be reduced to a set
of recursive multiplications with a scalar factor. Then we show that this
scalar factor can be adjusted such that the trellis computation is further
simplified and realized with only binary shifts. This shift-based B-ESS (1) can
be implemented for arbitrarily long blocklengths without incurring an increase
in complexity, and (2) can operate in a streaming mode similar to convolutional
coding.

address the morning commute congestion with heterogeneous travelers. We
introduce karma as a non-tradable mobility credit used by the commuters to bid
for access to a fast lane that is kept in free-flow. Commuters who did not bid
enough to enter the fast lane instead use a slow lane in which they might
experience congestion. At the end of each day, the karma spent by those
entering the fast lane is evenly redistributed to all commuters, and this
process repeats indefinitely. A core novelty of our approach is that we
generalize the notion of Value Of Time (VOT) by allowing it to vary dynamically
each day, e.g., as a function of the trip purpose, rather than being a static
characteristic of each individual. This allows us to asses the efficiency and
fairness of the system over the long-term instead of based on a single day. We
formalize the recurrent interactions among self-interested commuters as a
dynamic population game, and prove the existence of a Stationary Nash
Equilibrium (SNE). We then investigate the performance of CARMA through three
numerical case studies with different assumptions on the heterogeneity in VOT.
Our results demonstrate that CARMA closely approaches the efficiency of
classical optimal congestion pricing, while preventing individuals with a
higher (monetary) VOT from consistently taking advantage of the fast lane,
thereby providing a fair and efficient solution to the bottleneck congestion.

allow the weight matrix to change but restrict the overall impact which a layer

advancements in various code processing tasks, there is an impediment to the
wide and fluent adoption of these powerful models in software developers' daily
workflow: these large models consume hundreds of megabytes of memory and run
slowly on personal devices, which causes problems in model deployment and
greatly degrades the user experience.
  It motivates us to propose Compressor, a novel approach that can compress the
pre-trained models of code into extremely small models with negligible
performance sacrifice. Our proposed method formulates the design of tiny models
as simplifying the pre-trained model architecture: searching for a
significantly smaller model that follows an architectural design similar to the
original pre-trained model. Compressor proposes a genetic algorithm (GA)-based
strategy to guide the simplification process. Prior studies found that a model
with higher computational cost tends to be more powerful. Inspired by this
insight, the GA algorithm is designed to maximize a model's Giga floating-point
operations (GFLOPs), an indicator of the model computational cost, to satisfy
the constraint of the target model size. Then, we use the knowledge
distillation technique to train the small model: unlabelled data is fed into
the large model and the outputs are used as labels to train the small model. We
evaluate Compressor with two state-of-the-art pre-trained models, i.e.,
CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT, on two important tasks, i.e., vulnerability
prediction and clone detection. We use our method to compress pre-trained
models to a size (3 MB), which is 160$\times$ smaller than the original size.

tried to reduce the number of timesteps and training time required and proposed
regularization terms to the existing SB models to make the bidirectional
stochastic processes consistent and stable with a reduced number of timesteps.
Each regularization term was integrated into a single term to enable more
efficient training in computation time and memory usage. Applying this
regularized stochastic process to various generation tasks, the desired
translations between different distributions were obtained, and accordingly,
the possibility of generative modeling based on a stochastic process with
faster sampling speed could be confirmed. The code is available at

  prior","61 pages, 21 figures, 9 tables",,,,"stat.ME stat.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The training of high-dimensional regression models on comparably sparse data
is an important yet complicated topic, especially when there are many more
model parameters than observations in the data. From a Bayesian perspective,
inference in such cases can be achieved with the help of shrinkage prior
distributions, at least for generalized linear models. However, real-world data
usually possess multilevel structures, such as repeated measurements or natural
groupings of individuals, which existing shrinkage priors are not built to deal
with. We generalize and extend one of these priors, the R2D2 prior by Zhang et
al. (2020), to linear multilevel models leading to what we call the R2D2M2
prior. The proposed prior enables both local and global shrinkage of the model
parameters. It comes with interpretable hyperparameters, which we show to be
intrinsically related to vital properties of the prior, such as rates of
concentration around the origin, tail behavior, and amount of shrinkage the
prior exerts. We offer guidelines on how to select the prior's hyperparameters
by deriving shrinkage factors and measuring the effective number of non-zero
model coefficients. Hence, the user can readily evaluate and interpret the
amount of shrinkage implied by a specific choice of hyperparameters. Finally,
we perform extensive experiments on simulated and real data, showing that our
inference procedure for the prior is well calibrated, has desirable global and
local regularization properties and enables the reliable and interpretable
estimation of much more complex Bayesian multilevel models than was previously
possible.

results reported in this paper extend our understanding on the achievable rates

the Reidemeister--Schreier method, together with general recent results by
Dahmani & Guirardel and Ciobanu, Holt & Rees on the decidability of the
Diophantine problem in general classes of groups. First, we give a sample of
the methods of the article by proving that the one-relator group with defining
relation $a^mb^n = 1$ is virtually a direct product of hyperbolic groups for
all $m, n \geq 0$, and thus conclude decidability of the Diophantine problem in
such groups. As a corollary, we obtain that the Diophantine problem is
decidable in any torus knot group. Second, we study the two-generator,
one-relator groups $G_{m,n}$ with defining relation a commutator $[a^m, b^n] =
1$, where $m, n \geq 1$. In doing so, we define and study a natural class of
groups (RABSAGs), related to right-angled Artin groups (RAAGs). We reduce the
Diophantine problem in the groups $G_{m,n}$ to the Diophantine problem in
groups which are virtually certain RABSAGs. As a corollary of our methods, we
show that the submonoid membership problem is undecidable in the group
$G_{2,2}$ with the single defining relation $[a^2, b^2] = 1$. We use the recent
classification by Gray & Howie of RAAG subgroups of one-relator groups to
classify the RAAG subgroups of some RABSAGs, showing the potential usefulness
of one-relator theory to this area. Finally, we define and study Newman groups
$\operatorname{NG}(p,q)$, which are $(p+1)$-generated one-relator groups
generalising the solvable Baumslag--Solitar groups. We show that all such

for their presence. Recently \citet{Mondal2020b} reported the presence of weak
impulsive emissions from quiet Sun regions which seem to meet the requirements
of being radio counterparts of the hypothesized nanoflares. Detection of such
low-contrast weak emission from the quiet Sun is challenging and, given their
implications, it is important to confirm their presence. In this work, using
data from the Murchison Widefield Array, we explore the use of an independent
robust approach for their detection by separating the dominant slowly varying
component of emission from the weak impulsive one in the visibility domain. We
detect milli-SFU level bursts taking place all over the Sun and characterize
their brightness temperatures, distributions, morphologies, durations and
association with features seen in EUV images. We also attempt to constraint the
energies of the nonthermal particles using inputs from the FORWARD coronal

Both large Kirkpatrick-Baez modules and lobster eye X-ray telescopes may serve

  Multi-Access Edge Computing","32 pages, 10 figures",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In multi-access edge computing (MEC), most existing task software caching
works focus on statically caching data at the network edge, which may hardly
preserve high reusability due to the time-varying user requests in practice. To
this end, this work considers dynamic task software caching at the MEC server
to assist users' task execution. Specifically, we formulate a joint task
software caching update (TSCU) and computation offloading (COMO) problem to
minimize users' energy consumption while guaranteeing delay constraints, where
the limited cache size and computation capability of the MEC server, as well as
the time-varying task demand of users are investigated. This problem is proved
to be non-deterministic polynomial-time hard, so we transform it into two
sub-problems according to their temporal correlations, i.e., the real-time COMO
problem and the Markov decision process-based TSCU problem. We first model the
COMO problem as a multi-user game and propose a decentralized algorithm to
address its Nash equilibrium solution. We then propose a double deep Q-network
(DDQN)-based method to solve the TSCU policy. To reduce the computation
complexity and convergence time, we provide a new design for the deep neural
network (DNN) in DDQN, named state coding and action aggregation (SCAA). In
SCAA-DNN, we introduce a dropout mechanism in the input layer to code users'
activity states. Additionally, at the output layer, we devise a two-layer
architecture to dynamically aggregate caching actions, which is able to solve
the huge state-action space problem. Simulation results show that the proposed
solution outperforms existing schemes, saving over 12% energy, and converges
with fewer training episodes.

issues of non-stationarity and continuous control faced by cooperative
guidance, the natural evolutionary strategy (NES) is improved along with an
elitist adaptive learning technique to develop a novel natural co-evolutionary

to reduce the estimation bias caused by the interaction between the multiple

proposed by integrating the highly scalable co-evolutionary mechanism and the
traditional guidance strategy. Finally, three simulations under different

the flourishing multidisciplinary field of low-dimensional nanomaterials,

introduced. There, the electrons hop to their neighbors by always converting
the spin orientation up-side-down, which allows the up and down spin bases to
form fictitious bipartite connections. The gauge invariant Wilson loop operator
defined on a triangular unit serves as a marker to detect the presence of
chiral symmetry, and using this property, the chiral operator is constructed.

Two bipolar channel geometries are considered here; their behavior is examined

recently developed synthesis approach from specifications in the temporal logic
TSL. We present HyperTSL, an extension of TSL for the specification of
hyperproperties of infinite-state software. As a preprocessing step, we show
how to detect if a hyperproperty has an equivalent formulation as a (simpler)
trace property. Finally, we describe how to refine a synthesized contract to
adhere to its HyperTSL specification.

  Reconstruction","10 pages,10 figures,7 tables",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Magnetic resonance imaging serves as an essential tool for clinical
diagnosis. However, it suffers from a long acquisition time. The utilization of
deep learning, especially the deep generative models, offers aggressive
acceleration and better reconstruction in magnetic resonance imaging.
Nevertheless, learning the data distribution as prior knowledge and
reconstructing the image from limited data remains challenging. In this work,
we propose a novel Hankel-k-space generative model (HKGM), which can generate
samples from a training set of as little as one k-space data. At the prior
learning stage, we first construct a large Hankel matrix from k-space data,
then extract multiple structured k-space patches from the large Hankel matrix
to capture the internal distribution among different patches. Extracting
patches from a Hankel matrix enables the generative model to be learned from
redundant and low-rank data space. At the iterative reconstruction stage, it is
observed that the desired solution obeys the learned prior knowledge. The
intermediate reconstruction solution is updated by taking it as the input of
the generative model. The updated result is then alternatively operated by
imposing low-rank penalty on its Hankel matrix and data consistency con-strain
on the measurement data. Experimental results confirmed that the internal
statistics of patches within a single k-space data carry enough information for
learning a powerful generative model and provide state-of-the-art
reconstruction.

prevent leakage of training data when model updates from data owners are
aggregated. Secure aggregation protocols based on Homomorphic Encryption (HE)
have been utilized in industrial cross-silo FL systems, one of the settings
involved with privacy-sensitive organizations such as financial or medical,
presenting more stringent requirements on privacy security. However, existing
HE-based solutions have limitations in efficiency and security guarantees
against colluding adversaries without a Trust Third Party.
  This paper proposes an efficient Doubly Homomorphic Secure Aggregation (DHSA)
scheme for cross-silo FL, which utilizes multi-key Homomorphic Encryption
(MKHE) and seed homomorphic pseudorandom generator (SHPRG) as cryptographic
primitives. The application of MKHE provides strong security guarantees against
up to $N-2$ participates colluding with the aggregator, with no TTP required.
To mitigate the large computation and communication cost of MKHE, we leverage
the homomorphic property of SHPRG to replace the majority of MKHE computation
by computationally-friendly mask generation from SHPRG, while preserving the
security. Overall, the resulting scheme satisfies the stringent security
requirements of typical cross-silo FL scenarios, at the same time providing
high computation and communication efficiency for practical usage. We
experimentally demonstrate our scheme brings a speedup to 20$\times$ over the
state-of-the-art HE-based secure aggregation, and reduces the traffic volume to
approximately 1.5$\times$ inflation over the plain learning setting.

reduces the efficiency of FL. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) is a scheme
that reduces the latency of aggregation to improve efficiency, but the learning

the novel committee-based consensus algorithm for blockchain improves

theories of gravity, and confirms the duality between the luminosity distance
and the angular diameter distance through the conservation of surface
brightness. A violation of the Etherington distance duality due to lensing in a
non-metric spacetime would lead to fluctuations in surface brightness of
galaxies. Likewise, fluctuations of the surface brightness can arise in
classical astrophysics as a consequence of intrinsic tidal interaction of
galaxies with their environment. Therefore, we study these in two cases in
detail: Firstly, for intrinsic size fluctuations and the resulting changes in
surface brightness, and secondly, for an area-metric spacetime as an example of
a non-metric spacetime where the distance duality relation itself acquires
modifications. The aim of this work is to quantify whether a surface brightness
fluctuation effect due to area-metric gravity would be resolvable compared to
the similar effect caused by intrinsic alignment. We thus compare the auto- and
cross-correlations of the angular spectra in these two cases and show that the
fluctuations in intrinsic brightness can potentially be measured with a
cumulative signal-to-noise ratio $\Sigma(\ell) \geq 3$ in a Euclid-like survey.
The measurement in area-metric spacetimes, however, depends on the specific
parameter choices, which also determine the shape and amplitude of the spectra.
While lensing surveys do have sensitivity to lensing-induced surface brightness
fluctuations in area-metric spacetimes, the measurement does not seem to be
possible for natural values of the Etherington-breaking parameters.

be obtained from the other by moving a token from one vertex to one of its
unoccupied adjacent vertices. Under Token Jumping ($\mathsf{TJ}$), the target

Independent Set Reconfiguration (D$d$ISR) problem under
$\mathsf{TS}/\mathsf{TJ}$ asks if there is a corresponding sequence of adjacent

well-studied in the literature and its computational complexity on several

$\mathsf{TJ}$ it is in $\mathtt{P}$ for $d = 2$ but $\mathtt{PSPACE}$-complete

conserved-charge densities such as the net-baryon density $n_B(t)$ produced in
heavy ion collisions. While the effect is small at high collision energies
where the Bjorken energy density formula for the initial state is valid, the
effect is large at low collision energies, where the nuclear crossing time is
not small compared to the parton formation time. The temperature $T(t)$ and
chemical potentials $\mu(t)$ of the dense matter can be extracted from the
densities for a given equation of state (EOS). Therefore, including the nuclear
thickness is essential for the determination of the $T$-$\mu_B$ trajectory in
the QCD phase diagram for relativistic nuclear collisions at low to moderate
energies such as the RHIC-BES energies. In this proceeding, we will first
discuss our semi-analytical method that includes the nuclear thickness effect
and its results on the densities $\epsilon(t), n_B(t), n_Q(t)$, and $n_S(t)$.
Then, we will show the extracted $T(t), \mu_B(t), \mu_Q(t)$, and $\mu_S(t)$ for
a quark-gluon plasma using the ideal gas EOS with quantum or Boltzmann

in relation to the possible location of the QCD critical end point. This
semi-analytical model provides a convenient tool for exploring the trajectories

field of the high-energy QCD dynamics. The large transverse momenta at which
the two final-state objects are detected permits us to perform an analysis in
the spirit of the variable-flavor number scheme (VFNS), in which the cross
section for the hadroproduction of a light parton is convoluted with a
perturbative fragmentation function that describes the transition from a light
quark to a heavy hadron. The quarkonium collinear fragmentation function is
built as a product between a short-distance coefficient function, which encodes
the resummation of DGLAP type logarithms, and a non-perturbative long-distance
matrix element (LDME), calculated in the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD)

factorization, where the standard collinear approach is supplemented by the
resummation of leading and next-to-leading energy-type logarithms \emph{\`a la}

Moreover, the tripartite entanglement is also significantly enhanced in the
presence of OPA. The OPA not only enhances the strength of entanglement but
also increases the domain of entanglement over a wider space of detunings as
compared to the system when no OPA is present. Similarly, the robustness of
entanglement against temperature is also enhanced. Another important
consequence of OPA is the fact that it relaxes the requirement of strong
magnon-phonon coupling to generate cavity-magnon entanglement which is
necessary for the case when OPA is not present. We believe that the presented
scheme is a step forward to realize robust quantum entanglement using current

The unconventional nature relies on the $A1@1b$ band representation (BR) of the

spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the noncentrosymmetric structure induced by the Te
vacancy. Even though it has a metallic SOC band structure, the $\mathbb Z_2$
invariant is well defined due to the existence of the direct band gap and is
computed to be nontrivial. The calculated SHC is as large as 1.25$\times 10^3
\frac{\hbar}{e} (\Omega~cm)^{-1}$ at the Fermi level ($E_F$). By tuning the
chemical potential from $E_F-0.3$ to $E_F+0.3$ eV, it varies rapidly and
monotonically from $-1.2\times 10^3$ to 3.1$\times 10^3 \frac{\hbar}{e}

fluctuations of the global ground state in the local basis and provide the
energy required to run the engine. The reset part of the engine cycle is
particularly simple: The interacting many-body system is coupled to a cold bath
and allowed to relax to its entangled ground state. We illustrate our proposal
on two types of many-body systems: a chain of coupled qubits and coupled
harmonic oscillator networks. These models faithfully represent fermionic and
bosonic excitations, respectively. In both cases, analytical results for the
work output and efficiency of the engine can be obtained. Generically, the work
output scales as the number of quantum systems involved, while the efficiency
limits to a constant. We prove the efficiency is controlled by the ``local
entanglement gap'' -- the energy difference between the global ground state and
the lowest energy eigenstate of the local Hamiltonian. In the qubit chain case,
we highlight the impact of a quantum phase transition on the engine's
performance as work and efficiency sharply increase at the critical point. In
the case of a one-dimensional oscillator chain, we show the efficiency
approaches unity as the number of coupled oscillators increases, even at finite

between the directions to two pulsars was predicted by Hellings and Downs (HD)
in 1983. The variance $\sigma^2_{\rm tot}(\gamma)$ in this correlation was
recently calculated by Allen[1] for a single noise-free pulsar pair at angle
$\gamma$, which shows that after averaging over many pairs, the variance
reduces to an intrinsic cosmic variance $\sigma^2_{\rm cos}(\gamma)$. Here, we
extend this to an $arbitrary$ set of pulsars at specific sky locations, with
pulsar pairs binned by $\gamma$. We derive the linear combination of
pulsar-pair correlations which is the optimal estimator of the HD correlation
for each bin, illustrating our methods with plots of the expected range of
variation away from the HD curve, for the sets of pulsars monitored by three
active PTA collaborations. We compute the variance of and the covariance
between these binned estimates, and show that these reduce to the cosmic
variance and covariance $s(\gamma,\gamma')$ respectively, in the many-pulsar
limit. The likely fluctuations away from the HD curve $\mu_{\rm u}(\gamma)$ are
strongly correlated/anticorrelated in the three angular regions where $\mu_{\rm
u}(\gamma)$ is successively positive, negative, and positive. We also construct
the optimal estimator of the squared strain $h^2$. When there are very many
pulsar pairs, this determines $h^2$ with arbitrary precision because PTAs probe
an infinite set of GW modes. To assess observed deviations away from the HD

real-world static graphs. However, the success of static graphs has not fully
translated to dynamic graphs due to the limitations in model design, evaluation
settings, and training strategies. Concretely, existing dynamic GNNs do not
incorporate state-of-the-art designs from static GNNs, which limits their
performance. Current evaluation settings for dynamic GNNs do not fully reflect
the evolving nature of dynamic graphs. Finally, commonly used training methods
for dynamic GNNs are not scalable. Here we propose ROLAND, an effective graph
representation learning framework for real-world dynamic graphs. At its core,
the ROLAND framework can help researchers easily repurpose any static GNN to
dynamic graphs. Our insight is to view the node embeddings at different GNN
layers as hierarchical node states and then recurrently update them over time.
We then introduce a live-update evaluation setting for dynamic graphs that
mimics real-world use cases, where GNNs are making predictions and being
updated on a rolling basis. Finally, we propose a scalable and efficient
training approach for dynamic GNNs via incremental training and meta-learning.
We conduct experiments over eight different dynamic graph datasets on future
link prediction tasks. Models built using the ROLAND framework achieve on
average 62.7% relative mean reciprocal rank (MRR) improvement over
state-of-the-art baselines under the standard evaluation settings on three
datasets. We find state-of-the-art baselines experience out-of-memory errors
for larger datasets, while ROLAND can easily scale to dynamic graphs with 56
million edges. After re-implementing these baselines using the ROLAND training
strategy, ROLAND models still achieve on average 15.5% relative MRR improvement
over the baselines.

Given a pair of encrypted feature vectors, we perform the following ciphertext
operations, i) feature concatenation, ii) fusion and dimensionality reduction
through a learned linear projection, iii) scale normalization to unit
$\ell_2$-norm, and iv) match score computation. Our method, dubbed HEFT
(Homomorphically Encrypted Fusion of biometric Templates), is custom-designed
to overcome the unique constraint imposed by FHE, namely the lack of support
for non-arithmetic operations. From an inference perspective, we systematically
explore different data packing schemes for computationally efficient linear
projection and introduce a polynomial approximation for scale normalization.
From a training perspective, we introduce an FHE-aware algorithm for learning
the linear projection matrix to mitigate errors induced by approximate
normalization. Experimental evaluation for template fusion and matching of face

performance by 11.07% and 9.58% AUROC compared to the respective unibiometric

the case where the optimum is on the boundary of the constraint set and the

we develop rely on a geometric ergodicity proof. This extends a result on
Markov chains by Hajek (1982) to the area of stochastic approximation
algorithms. As examples, we show how the results apply to linear programming

predicting the angular diameters of stars. They offer the possibility to
calculate very precise spectrophotometric distances by the eclipsing binary

stars (SB2 DEBs) with precisely known trigonometric parallaxes allow for a
calibration of SBCRs with unprecedented precision. In order to improve such
calibrations, it is important to enlarge the calibration sample of suitable
eclipsing binaries with very precisely determined physical parameters.
  We carefully chose a sample of ten SB2 DEBs in the solar neighbourhood which
contain inactive main-sequence components. The components have spectral types
from early A to early K. All systems have high-precision parallaxes from the
Gaia mission. We analysed high precision ground- and space-based photometry
simultaneously with the radial velocity curves derived from HARPS spectra. We
used spectral disentangling to obtain the individual spectra of the components
and used these to derive precise atmospheric parameters and chemical
abundances. For almost all components, we derived precise surface temperatures
and metallicities.
  We derived absolute dimensions for 20 stars with an average precision of 0.2%
and 0.5% for masses and radii, respectively. Three systems show slow apsidal
motion. One system, HD 32129, is most likely a triple system with a much
fainter K6V companion. Also three systems contain metallic-line components and
show strong enhancements of barium and ittrium. The components of all systems

systematically varying the width and exponent of the underlying power laws, we
analyze the role of particle size distributions on the structure of jammed

the relative abundance of large-large/intermediate and small-small particle

We propose that this problem can be caused by the assumption of locally flat

considers surface roughness, and accounts for solar illumination, shadows cast
by topography, self-heating, thermal reradiation, and heat conduction. We
couple the thermophysical model to a model of first-order desorption of lunar
surface water and demonstrate that surface roughness substantially increases
the capability of the Moon to retain water on its sunlit hemisphere at any
latitude, and within $45^{\circ}$ of the poles, at any time of the lunar day.
Hence, we show that lunar surface roughness has a strong influence on lunar

take account of surface roughness to get an accurate picture of the amount of

without the need for combinatorial optimization techniques. Instead, the amount
of noise injected into the accurate computations is learned during network
training using backpropagation. A probabilistic model of the multiplier error
is presented to bridge the gap between the domains; the model estimates the
standard deviation of the approximate multiplier error, connecting solutions in
the additive Gaussian noise space to actual hardware instances. Our experiments
show that the combination of heterogeneous approximation and neural network
retraining reduces the energy consumption for multiplications by 70% to 79% for
different ResNet variants on the CIFAR-10 dataset with a Top-1 accuracy loss
below one percentage point. For the more complex Tiny ImageNet task, our VGG16
model achieves a 53 % reduction in energy consumption with a drop in Top-5
accuracy of 0.5 percentage points. We further demonstrate that our error model
can predict the parameters of an approximate multiplier in the context of the
commonly used additive Gaussian noise (AGN) model with high accuracy. Our
software implementation is available under

tasks that varied along three cognitive processes (apply, evaluate, create) and
three knowledge types (factual, conceptual, procedural knowledge). A

qualitative analysis of participants' think-aloud comments and recorded screen
activities. We investigate three research questions. First, in RQ1, we study
the impact of the learning objective on pathway characteristics (e.g., pathway
length). Second, in RQ2, we study the impact of the learning objective on the
types of A\&K cells traversed along the pathway. Third, in RQ3, we study common

on the knowledge type of the objective. We discuss implications of our results
for designing search systems to support learning.

assume that the user preference can be dominated by a small amount of latent
factors, and propose to cluster the users for computing more accurate IPS via
increasing the exposure densities. Basically, such method is similar with the
spirit of stratification models in applied statistics. However, unlike previous
heuristic stratification strategy, we learn the cluster criterion by presenting
the users with low ranking embeddings, which are future shared with the user

perspective, RWE arises from diverse sources such as randomized controlled
trials that make use of real-world data, observational studies, and other study
designs. This paper illustrates a principled approach to assessing the validity
and interpretability of RWE.
  Methods: We applied the roadmap to a published observational study of the
dose-response association between ritodrine hydrochloride and pulmonary edema
among women pregnant with twins in Japan. The goal was to identify barriers to
causal effect estimation beyond unmeasured confounding reported by the study's
authors, and to explore potential options for overcoming the barriers that
robustify results.
  Results: Following the roadmap raised issues that led us to formulate
alternative causal questions that produced more reliable, interpretable RWE.
The process revealed a lack of information in the available data to identify a
causal dose-response curve. However, under explicit assumptions the effect of
treatment with any amount of ritodrine versus none, albeit a less ambitious
parameter, can be estimated from data.
  Conclusion: Before RWE can be used in support of clinical and regulatory
decision-making, its quality and reliability must be systematically evaluated.
The TL roadmap prescribes how to carry out a thorough, transparent, and
realistic assessment of RWE. We recommend this approach be a routine part of
any decision-making process.

  transiting the mid-type M dwarf G 9-40","Accepted for publication in A&A","A&A 666, A154 (2022)","10.1051/0004-6361/202244426",,"astro-ph.EP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Context. Despite being a prominent subset of the exoplanet population
discovered in the past three decades, the nature and provenance of
sub-Neptune-sized planets are still one of the open questions in exoplanet
science. Aims. For planets orbiting bright stars, precisely measuring the
orbital and planet parameters of the system is the best approach to distinguish
between competing theories regarding their formation and evolution. Methods. We
obtained 69 new radial velocity observations of the mid-M dwarf G 9-40 with the
CARMENES instrument to measure for the first time the mass of its transiting
sub-Neptune planet, G 9-40 b, discovered in data from the K2 mission. Results.
Combined with new observations from the TESS mission during Sectors 44, 45, and
46, we are able to measure the radius of the planet to an uncertainty of 3.4%
(Rb = 1.900 +- 0.065 Re) and determine its mass with a precision of 16% (Mb =
4.00 +- 0.63 Me). The resulting bulk density of the planet is inconsistent with
a terrestrial composition and suggests the presence of either a water-rich core
or a significant hydrogen-rich envelope. Conclusions. G 9-40 b is referred to
as a keystone planet due to its location in period-radius space within the
radius valley. Several theories offer explanations for the origin and
properties of this population and this planet is a valuable target for testing
the dependence of those models on stellar host mass. By virtue of its
brightness and small size of the host, it joins L 98-59 d as one of the two
best warm (Teq ~ 400 K) sub-Neptunes for atmospheric characterization with
JWST, which will probe cloud formation in sub-Neptune-sized planets and break
the degeneracies of internal composition models.

effects that lie beyond-all-orders of a typical asymptotic expansion; when
collected, the full expansion is known as the trans-series. Applied exponential
asymptotics has been enormously successful in developing practical tools for
studying the leading exponentials of a trans-series expansion, typically in the
context of singular non-linear perturbative differential or integral equations.
Separate to applied exponential asymptotics, there exists a closely related
line of development known as \'Ecalle's theory of resurgence, which describes
the connection between trans-series and a certain class of holomorphic
functions known as resurgent functions. This connection is realised through the
process of Borel resummation. However, in contrast to singularly perturbed
problems, Borel resummation and \'Ecalle's resurgence theory have mainly
focused on non-parametric asymptotic expansions (i.e. differential equations
without a parameter). The relationships between these latter areas and applied
exponential asymptotics has not been thoroughly examined, partially due to
differences in language and emphasis. In this work, we explore these
connections by developing an alternative framework for the factorial-over-power
ansatz in exponential asymptotics that is centred on the Borel plane. Our work
clarifies a number of elements used in applied exponential asymptotics, such as
the heuristic use of Van Dyke's rule and the universality of
factorial-over-power ansatzes. Along the way, we provide a number of useful
tools for probing more pathological problems in exponential asymptotics known
to arise in applications; this includes problems with coalescing singularities,
nested boundary layers, and more general late-term behaviours.

reconstruction process, the object position information is extracted
independently and combining motion-compensation reconstruction algorithm to
decouple the object motion from image information. As a result, the anti-motion

results show that for a moving object with an angular velocity of up to
0.5rad/s relative to the imaging system, the proposed method achieves a

games, which directly affects players' satisfactions and game experience. Most
of the matchmaking systems largely rely on precise estimation of players' game
skills to construct equitable games. However, the skill rating of a novice is
usually inaccurate, as current matchmaking rating algorithms require
considerable amount of games for learning the true skill of a new player. Using
these unreliable skill scores at early stages for matchmaking usually leads to
disparities in terms of team performance, which causes negative game
experience. This is known as the ''cold-start'' problem for matchmaking rating
algorithms.
  To overcome this conundrum, this paper proposes QuickSKill, a deep learning
based novice skill estimation framework to quickly probe abilities of new
players in online multiplayer games. QuickSKill extracts sequential performance
features from initial few games of a player to predict his/her future skill
rating with a dedicated neural network, thus delivering accurate skill
estimation at the player's early game stage. By employing QuickSKill for
matchmaking, game fairness can be dramatically improved in the initial
cold-start period. We conduct experiments in a popular mobile multiplayer game
in both offline and online scenarios. Results obtained with two real-world
anonymized gaming datasets demonstrate that proposed QuickSKill delivers
precise estimation of game skills for novices, leading to significantly lower
team skill disparities and better player game experience. To the best of our
knowledge, proposed QuickSKill is the first framework that tackles the

  Concentration in Fair Launches",,,,,"cs.CR cs.CE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  With advancements in distributed ledger technologies and smart contracts,
tokenized voting rights gained prominence within Decentralized Finance (DeFi).
Voting rights tokens (aka. governance tokens) are fungible tokens that grant
individual holders the right to vote upon the fate of a project. The motivation
behind these tokens is to achieve decentral control. Because the initial
allocations of these tokens is often un-democratic, the DeFi project Yearn
Finance experimented with a fair launch allocation where no tokens are
pre-mined and all participants have an equal opportunity to receive them.
Regardless, research on voting rights tokens highlights the formation of
oligarchies over time. The hypothesis is that the tokens' tradability is the
cause of concentration. To examine this proposition, this paper uses an
Agent-based Model to simulate and analyze the concentration of voting rights
tokens post fair launch under different trading modalities. It serves to
examine three distinct token allocation scenarios considered as fair. The
results show that regardless of the allocation, concentration persistently
occurs. It confirms the hypothesis that the disease is endogenous: the cause of
concentration is the tokens tradablility. The findings inform theoretical
understandings and practical implications for on-chain governance mediated by
tokens.

with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), making them suffer seriously from
computation and memory overheads on large temporal graphs. So far, scalability
of dynamic graph representation learning on large temporal graphs remains one
of the major challenges. In this paper, we present a scalable framework, namely
SpikeNet, to efficiently capture the temporal and structural patterns of
temporal graphs. We explore a new direction in that we can capture the evolving
dynamics of temporal graphs with spiking neural networks (SNNs) instead of
RNNs. As a low-power alternative to RNNs, SNNs explicitly model graph dynamics
as spike trains of neuron populations and enable spike-based propagation in an
efficient way. Experiments on three large real-world temporal graph datasets
demonstrate that SpikeNet outperforms strong baselines on the temporal node
classification task with lower computational costs. Particularly, SpikeNet
generalizes to a large temporal graph (2.7M nodes and 13.9M edges) with
significantly fewer parameters and computation overheads.Our code is publicly

the need for accurate option pricing models. Yet, existing methodologies fail
to cope with the volatile nature of the emerging DAs. Many models have been
proposed to address the unorthodox market dynamics and frequent disruptions in
the microstructure caused by the non-stationarity, and peculiar statistics, in
DA markets. However, they are either prone to the curse of dimensionality, as
additional complexity is required to employ traditional theories, or they
overfit historical patterns that may never repeat. Instead, we leverage recent
advances in market regime (MR) clustering with the Implied Stochastic
Volatility Model (ISVM). Time-regime clustering is a temporal clustering
method, that clusters the historic evolution of a market into different
volatility periods accounting for non-stationarity. ISVM can incorporate
investor expectations in each of the sentiment-driven periods by using implied
volatility (IV) data. In this paper, we applied this integrated time-regime
clustering and ISVM method (termed MR-ISVM) to high-frequency data on BTC

contributes to overcome the burden of complex adaption to jumps in higher order

assess a geometric-distribution-probability (GDP) weighted integration of the
diffusion-equation derived time-dependent photon fluence-rate at a spherical
boundary, in response to uniform, synchronous, and Delta-functional photon
generations within the sphere. The GDP weights the contribution of the modeled
Delta-functional photon sources to the temporal behavior of the photon fluence
rate at the spherical boundary-domain based on the line-of-sight distance
between the modeled-photon source and the same field point. The integral
manifests a bi-phasic pattern versus time with a global minimum followed by an
exponential growth. The line-of-sight length that corresponds to the time of
global minimum decreases monotonically as the size of the sphere increases. The
condition that this line-of-sight length equaling the radius of the sphere is
hypothesized to indicate a threshold whereby the medium can sustain the growth
of the photon fluence-rate at the boundary over time. This threshold
line-of-sight length is assessed over a gain/scattering ratio of [0.001, 10000]
covering the diffusive to quasi-ballistic regimes. The threshold line-of-sight
length applied with a simple empirical gain/scattering ratio predicts the
threshold size over the diffusive region and outperforms the threshold size
given by the eigen-mode-decomposition in the semi-ballistic region, when
compared to the radiative transfer approach. The method sheds new insights to

One has fourth-order gauge field equations, which lead to a static linear

force, the model predicts that in the early universe, when the gravitational
force was dominant, not only was the expansion occurring at a decreasing rate,
the rate of change of the deceleration was decreasing due to a $1/r^2$

small-area surface by means of the windowed Green function method, which
exhibits high-order convergence as the size of the truncated surface increases.

solved by means of the standard Galerkin method of moments (MoM) using RWG
