collisions provides a novel probe of the global quark polarization and
hadronization mechanism. In this paper, we discuss the spin alignment of a
short-lived vector meson, namely K*, arising from the hadronic rescattering
process using the UrQMD model. This spin alignment is not related to global
quark polarization but cannot be distinguished from those arising from global
quark polarization in experiments. The spin alignment parameter $\rho_{00}$ is
found to deviate from 1/3 by up to -0.008 (0.03) with respect to the reaction
(production) plane. These deviations are much larger than the expected signal
from all the theoretical models implementing the conventional global quark
polarization mechanism as well as the current experimental precision, and
should be considered seriously when comparing measurements with theoretical
calculations.

we achieve the best performance in terms of stability average score, distortion

  assumptions",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the problem of designing an optimal sequence of
interventions in a causal graphical model to minimize cumulative regret with
respect to the best intervention in hindsight. This is, naturally, posed as a
causal bandit problem. The focus is on causal bandits for linear structural
equation models (SEMs) and soft interventions. It is assumed that the graph's
structure is known and has $N$ nodes. Two linear mechanisms, one soft
intervention and one observational, are assumed for each node, giving rise to
$2^N$ possible interventions. Majority of the existing causal bandit algorithms
assume that at least the interventional distributions of the reward node's
parents are fully specified. However, there are $2^N$ such distributions (one
corresponding to each intervention), acquiring which becomes prohibitive even
in moderate-sized graphs. This paper dispenses with the assumption of knowing
these distributions or their marginals. Two algorithms are proposed for the
frequentist (UCB-based) and Bayesian (Thompson Sampling-based) settings. The
key idea of these algorithms is to avoid directly estimating the $2^N$ reward
distributions and instead estimate the parameters that fully specify the SEMs
(linear in $N$) and use them to compute the rewards. In both algorithms, under
boundedness assumptions on noise and the parameter space, the cumulative
regrets scale as $\tilde{\cal O} (d^{L+\frac{1}{2}} \sqrt{NT})$, where $d$ is
the graph's maximum degree, and $L$ is the length of its longest causal path.
Additionally, a minimax lower of $\Omega(d^{\frac{L}{2}-2}\sqrt{T})$ is
presented, which suggests that the achievable and lower bounds conform in their
scaling behavior with respect to the horizon $T$ and graph parameters $d$ and
$L$.

Chain (SFC) paradigm, where network functions are implemented via software. In
particular, container virtualization is becoming a popular approach to deploy
network functions and to enable resource slicing among several tenants. The
resulting infrastructure is a complex system composed by a huge amount of
containers implementing different SFC functionalities, along with different
tenants sharing the same chain. The complexity of such a scenario lead us to
evaluate two critical metrics: the steady-state availability (the probability
that a system is functioning in long runs) and the latency (the time between a
service request and the pertinent response). Consequently, we propose a
latency-driven availability assessment for multi-tenant service chains
implemented via Containerized Network Functions (CNFs). We adopt a multi-state
system to model single CNFs and the queueing formalism to characterize the
service latency. To efficiently compute the availability, we develop a modified
version of the Multidimensional Universal Generating Function (MUGF) technique.
Finally, we solve an optimization problem to minimize the SFC cost under an
availability constraint. As a relevant example of SFC, we consider a
containerized version of IP Multimedia Subsystem, whose parameters have been
estimated through fault injection techniques and load tests.

unknown parameters, one that represents geometric and material variations, and
another that captures energy losses in the system mainly through damping. The
data for parameter estimation is obtained from a limited set of measurements,
which is conducive to applications in structural health monitoring where the
exact state of an existing structure is typically unknown and only a limited
amount of data samples can be collected in the field. The trained model can
also be extrapolated under both standard and extreme conditions using the
identified structural parameters. We compare with pure data-driven Neural

However, when there are missing modalities, the number of available modalities

To solve this problem, we propose a transformer based fusion block called
TFusion. Different from preset formulations or convolution based methods, the
proposed block automatically learns to fuse available modalities without
synthesizing or zero-padding missing ones. Specifically, the feature
representations extracted from upstream processing model are projected as
tokens and fed into transformer layers to generate latent multimodal
correlations. Then, to reduce the dependence on particular modalities, a modal

be applied by the downstream decision model. The proposed TFusion block can be

  Q-learning-based Dynamic Pricing",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The widespread adoption of distributed energy resources, and the advent of
smart grid technologies, have allowed traditionally passive power system users
to become actively involved in energy trading. Recognizing the fact that the
traditional centralized grid-driven energy markets offer minimal profitability
to these users, recent research has shifted focus towards decentralized
peer-to-peer (P2P) energy markets. In these markets, users trade energy with
each other, with higher benefits than buying or selling to the grid. However,
most researches in P2P energy trading largely overlook the user perception in
the trading process, assuming constant availability, participation, and full
compliance. As a result, these approaches may result in negative attitudes and
reduced engagement over time. In this paper, we design an automated P2P energy
market that takes user perception into account. We employ prospect theory to
model the user perception and formulate an optimization framework to maximize
the buyer's perception while matching demand and production. Given the
non-linear and non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we propose
Differential Evolution-based Algorithm for Trading Energy called DEbATE.
Additionally, we introduce a risk-sensitive Q-learning algorithm, named Pricing
mechanism with Q-learning and Risk-sensitivity (PQR), which learns the optimal
price for sellers considering their perceived utility. Results based on real
traces of energy consumption and production, as well as realistic prospect
theory functions, show that our approach achieves a 26% higher perceived value
for buyers and generates 7% more reward for sellers, compared to a recent state
of the art approach.

develop effective control and energy storage schemes to manage the variable

In this paper, we introduce a hybrid energy storage system composed of battery
and hydrogen energy storage to handle the uncertainties related to electricity
prices, renewable energy production and consumption. We aim to improve
renewable energy utilisation and minimise energy costs and carbon emissions
while ensuring energy reliability and stability within the network. To achieve
this, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient approach,
which is a deep reinforcement learning-based control strategy to optimise the
scheduling of the hybrid energy storage system and energy demand in real-time.
The proposed approach is model-free and does not require explicit knowledge and
rigorous mathematical models of the smart energy network environment.
Simulation results based on real-world data show that: (i) integration and
optimised operation of the hybrid energy storage system and energy demand
reduces carbon emissions by 78.69%, improves cost savings by 23.5% and
renewable energy utilisation by over 13.2% compared to other baseline models

practice, recent studies propose to train brain tumor segmentation models with
unpaired images and capture complementary information through modality
translation. However, these models cannot fully exploit the complementary
information from different modalities. In this work, we thus present a novel
two-step (intra-modality and inter-modality) curriculum disentanglement
learning framework to effectively utilize privileged semi-paired images, i.e.
limited paired images that are only available in training, for brain tumor
segmentation. Specifically, in the first step, we propose to conduct
reconstruction and segmentation with augmented intra-modality style-consistent
images. In the second step, the model jointly performs reconstruction,
unsupervised/supervised translation, and segmentation for both unpaired and
paired inter-modality images. A content consistency loss and a supervised
translation loss are proposed to leverage complementary information from
different modalities in this step. Through these two steps, our method
effectively extracts modality-specific style codes describing the attenuation
of tissue features and image contrast, and modality-invariant content codes
containing anatomical and functional information from the input images.
Experiments on three brain tumor segmentation tasks show that our model
outperforms competing segmentation models based on unpaired images.

signals. Compared to speech, the heterogeneity and structure of the musical
sound texture offers new challenges. In this work we focus on one specific
artifact that some vocoder models designed for speech tend to exhibit when
applied to music: the perceived instability of pitch when synthesizing
sustained notes. We argue that the characteristic sound of this artifact is due
to the lack of horizontal phase coherence, which is often the result of using a
time-domain target space with a model that is invariant to time-shifts, such as
a convolutional neural network. We propose a new vocoder model that is
specifically designed for music. Key to improving the pitch stability is the
choice of a shift-invariant target space that consists of the magnitude
spectrum and the phase gradient. We discuss the reasons that inspired us to
re-formulate the vocoder task, outline a working example, and evaluate it on

Locating Unfairness through Canonical Inverse Design (LUCID), we generate a

potential unethical biases by repeatedly interrogating the decision-making

consider how opinions evolve either on time-independent networks or on temporal
networks with edges that follow Poisson statistics. Most such models are
Markovian. However, in many real-life networks, interactions between
individuals (and hence the edges of a network) follow non-Poisson processes and
thus yield dynamics with memory-dependent effects. In this paper, we model
opinion dynamics in which the entities of a temporal network interact and
change their opinions via random social interactions. When the edges have
non-Poisson interevent statistics, the corresponding opinion models are have
non-Markovian dynamics. We derive an opinion model that is governed by an
arbitrary waiting-time distribution (WTD) and illustrate a variety of induced
opinion models from common WTDs (including Dirac delta distributions,
exponential distributions, and heavy-tailed distributions). We analyze the
convergence to consensus of these models and prove that homogeneous
memory-dependent models of opinion dynamics in our framework always converge to
the same steady state regardless of the WTD. We also conduct a numerical
investigation of the effects of waiting-time distributions on both transient
dynamics and steady states. We observe that models that are induced by
heavy-tailed WTDs converge to a steady state more slowly than those with light
tails (or with compact support) and that entities with larger waiting times
exert a larger influence on the mean opinion at steady state.

understand how the particles impinge, erode and rebound from a target plate.
The motivation behind this study is understanding dust ingestion and erosion in
aviation gas-turbine engines. The conveying system consists of a constant area
duct in which particles are injected in the upstream direction using a particle
seeder. The particles exit the duct through a converging nozzle and are
directed towards a target plate. Particles of varying sizes are tested at two
different gas speeds.
  The particle velocity at the conveyor duct exit follows a trend inversely
proportional to diameter. After exiting, particles respond differently to
changes in the flow field based on their diameter. The largest particles move
ballistically, so they impact the target with nearly the same velocity they had
at the duct exit. However, small particles follow the flow streamlines around
the target. This causes them to both significantly slow down and to disperse in
all directions. The combination of the exit velocity and the near-target
trajectory behaviors leads to a non-monotonic trend of particle impact velocity
as a function of particle diameter. The importance of these effects depends
strongly on the relative angle between the conveyor duct and the target plate.
  LES are compared to RANS, and it is demonstrated that RANS are capable of
accurately predicting mean particle impact statistics. However, RANS results
display narrower statistical variation than LES, which suggests that particle
dispersion is underpredicted in RANS.

considerable number of species go extinct over a relatively short period of
time. The magnitude of extinction varies between the events, the most well
known are the ``Big Five'' when more than one half of all species got extinct.
There were many extinctions with a smaller magnitude too. It is widely believed
that the common trigger leading to a mass extinction is a climate change such a
global warming or global cooling. There are, however, many open questions with
regard to the effect and potential importance of specific factors and
processes. In this paper, we develop a novel mathematical model that takes into
account two factors largely overlooked in the mass extinctions literature,
namely, (i) the active feedback of phytoplankton to the climate through
changing the albedo of the ocean surface and (ii) the species's adaptive
evolutionary response to a climate change. We show that whether species goes
extinct or not depends on a subtle interplay between the scale of the climate
change and the rate of the evolutionary response. We also show that species's
response to a fast climate change can exhibit long transient dynamics (false
extinction) when the species population density remain at a low value for a
long time before recovering to its safe steady state value. Finally, we show
that the distribution of extinction frequencies predicted by our model is
generally consistent with the fossil record.

In concert, these achieve satisfaction of Gauss laws. All of these, were
restricted to conditionally stable explicit time stepping. More recently, there
has been advances to the state of art. It is now possible to use a implicit EM
FEMPIC method while satisfying Gauss laws to machine precision. This enables
choosing time step sizes dictated by physics as opposed to geometry. In this
paper, we take this a step further. For devices characterized by a narrowband
high frequency response, choosing a time-step size based on the highest
frequency of interest is considerably expensive. In this paper, we use methods
derived from envelope tracking to construct an EM-FEMPIC method that
analytically provides for the high-frequency oscillations of the system,
allowing for analysis at considerable coarser time-step sizes even in the
presence of non-linear effects from active media such as plasmas.
Consequentially, we demonstrate how the pointwise metric used for measuring
satisfaction of Gauss Laws breaks down when prescribing analytical fast fields

show that employees of companies from various industries, diverse in size and
location, prefer to alter working in the office with working at home, coined as
hybrid or flexible working arrangements. As a result, the post-pandemic times
are associated with empty offices, confused managers and organizational leaders
not knowing what to do with the often-expensive rental contracts. In this
paper, we investigate the employee presence in the offices in two software
companies and dive deeper into the reasons behind the preferences to work
remotely, practices that help to attract employees back into the offices and,
in cases when this is not possible, the ways companies can repurpose the office
space for the future needs of their employees. The latter are based on the
qualitative analysis of interviews and survey responses. Our findings suggest
that since the fall 2021 the offices were half-empty and that, on average, the
daily office presence varies between 15-30%. The reasons for working remotely
include behavioural and practical motivations, as well as factors related to
office equipment and facilities, and the nature of the work tasks. Finally, we
discuss the practical implications of our findings on the future work
arrangements.

deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the past few years, which have
become the de-facto standard for both academia and industry. However, they have
inbuilt inductive bias of locality and do not capture global characteristics of
an image due to the CNN-based architectures. They also lack long-range temporal
modeling considering computational costs when dealing with feature maps of
multiple frames. In this paper, we propose VMFormer: a transformer-based
end-to-end method for video matting. It makes predictions on alpha mattes of
each frame from learnable queries given a video input sequence. Specifically,
it leverages self-attention layers to build global integration of feature
sequences with short-range temporal modeling on successive frames. We further
apply queries to learn global representations through cross-attention in the
transformer decoder with long-range temporal modeling upon all queries. In the
prediction stage, both queries and corresponding feature maps are used to make
the final prediction of alpha matte. Experiments show that VMFormer outperforms
previous CNN-based video matting methods on the composited benchmarks. To our
best knowledge, it is the first end-to-end video matting solution built upon a
full vision transformer with predictions on the learnable queries. The project

from the region where the charge density exceeds the critical value and advect
them along at a high Lorentz factor. The system consisting of the Alfv\'{e}n
wave and charges being carried with it, which we call charge-carrying
Alfv\'{e}n wave (CC-AW), moves through a medium with small, but non-zero,
plasma density. We find that the interaction between CC-AW and the stationary
medium has a 2-stream like instability which leads to the emergence of a strong
electric field along the direction of the unperturbed magnetic field. The
growth rate of this instability is of order the plasma frequency of the medium
encountered by the CC-AW. Our numerical code follows the system for hundreds of
wave periods. The numerical calculations suggest that the final strength of the
electric field is of order a few percent of the Alfv\'{e}n wave amplitude.
Little radiation is produced by the sinusoidally oscillating currents
associated with the instability during the linear growth phase. However, in the
nonlinear phase, the fluctuating current density produces strong EM radiation
near the plasma frequency and limits the growth of the instability.

selects a particular layer for filter-pruning based on its contribution to
overall network complexity. We follow a procedure that directly trains the

present between two spatial subregions, while for mixed states (such as at
finite temperature) only the LN remains a good entanglement measure. Our focus
is on regions that have corners, either adjacent or tip-touching. We first
obtain non-perturbative properties regarding the geometrical dependence of the
LN and MI in a large family of isotropic states, including fractional quantum
Hall states. A close similarity is observed with mutual charge fluctuations,
where super-universal angle dependence holds. For the MI, we make stronger
statements due to strong subadditivity. We also give ramifications of our
general analysis to conformal field theories (CFTs) in two spatial dimensions.
We then explicitly verify these properties with integer quantum Hall states. To
do so we develop two independent approaches to obtain the fermionic LN, which
takes into account Fermi statistics: an overlap-matrix method, and a real-space

  Results: STA gives rise to a curved particle spectrum that is morphologically
different from the usual shock-accelerated spectrum. As a consequence of this
structural difference in the underlying particle energy spectrum, various
multi-wavelength features arise in the spectral energy distribution of the

requirements of wave functions, the past two years have witnessed the rise of
novel multi-gap dependent topological states, the properties of which go beyond
these approaches and are yet to be fully explored. Thriving upon these
insights, we report on uncharted anomalous phases and properties that can only
arise in out-of-equilibrium Floquet settings. In particular, we identify
Floquet-induced non-Abelian braiding mechanisms, which in turn lead to a phase
characterized by an anomalous Euler class, the prime example of a multi-gap
topological invariant. Most strikingly, we also retrieve the first example of
an `anomalous Dirac string phase'. This gapped out-of-equilibrium phase
features an unconventional Dirac string configuration that physically manifests
itself via anomalous edge states on the boundary. Our results therefore not

puzzling still is the apparent lack of evolution in the abundance of such
objects between $z \sim 9$ and the highest redshifts yet probed, $z \sim

LFs, semi-empirical models calibrated to UVLFs and colours at $4 \lesssim z

individual JWST galaxies, including their stellar masses, ages, and
rest-ultraviolet spectral slopes. We then show that order-of-magnitude scatter
in the star formation rate of galaxies (at fixed halo mass) can indeed boost
the abundance of bright galaxies, provided that star formation is more
efficient than expected in low-mass halos. However, this solution to the
abundance problem introduces tension elsewhere: because it relies on the
up-scattering of low-mass halos into bright magnitude bins, one expects typical
ages, masses, and spectral slopes to be much lower than constraints from
galaxies observed thus far. This tension can be alleviated by non-negligible
reddening, suggesting that -- if the first batch of photometrically-selected
candidates are confirmed -- star formation \textit{and} dust production could
be more efficient than expected in galaxies at $z \gtrsim 10$.

constraints. The algorithms naturally follow from steps aimed at recovering the
gradient-decent algorithm based on ODE solvers that explicitly account for
sensitivity of the ODE solution. In our first proposed algorithm we avoid
explicitly solving the ODE by integrating the ODE solver as a sequence of

limiting their utility for bioengineering applications. Recently-developed
light-activatable motors, which only crosslink the microtubules under

However, the coupled dynamics of active networks and fluid is still poorly
understood. Here we construct a coarse-grained model that predicts active
matter and fluid flows under dynamic optical input, which shows good agreement
with experiments. Using light bars as the basic units, we are able to define
the programming language of active matter and create local stretching and
mixing flows. In general the flow fields induced by individual bars cannot be
linearly superimposed in a composition. Combining theoretical predictions and
experimental results, we find that the linear superimposition can be achieved
above a critical distance. Therefore, different flows can be realized
simultaneously within a single channel through the spatio-temporal composition
and manipulation of light patterns, making multitasking possible in a single
channel. Our theoretical framework may be extended for other emergent

hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains accentuate
different aspects of the tissue landscape. In the case of detecting metastases,
IHC provides a distinct readout that is readily interpretable by pathologists.
IHC, however, is a more expensive approach and not available at all medical
centers. Virtually generating IHC images from H&E using deep neural networks
thus becomes an attractive alternative. Deep generative models such as
CycleGANs learn a semantically-consistent mapping between two image domains,
while emulating the textural properties of each domain. They are therefore a
suitable choice for stain transfer applications. However, they remain fully
unsupervised, and possess no mechanism for enforcing biological consistency in
stain transfer. In this paper, we propose an extension to CycleGANs in the form
of a region of interest discriminator. This allows the CycleGAN to learn from
unpaired datasets where, in addition, there is a partial annotation of objects
for which one wishes to enforce consistency. We present a use case on whole
slide images, where an IHC stain provides an experimentally generated signal
for metastatic cells. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach over prior
art in stain transfer on histopathology tiles over two datasets. Our code and

requires models to track entity states across the development of a narrative. A
complete procedural understanding solution should combine three core aspects:
local and global views of the inputs, and global view of outputs. Prior methods
considered a subset of these aspects, resulting in either low precision or low
recall. In this paper, we propose Coalescing Global and Local Information
(CGLI), a new model that builds entity- and timestep-aware input
representations (local input) considering the whole context (global input), and
we jointly model the entity states with a structured prediction objective
(global output). Thus, CGLI simultaneously optimizes for both precision and
recall. We extend CGLI with additional output layers and integrate it into a
story reasoning framework. Extensive experiments on a popular procedural text

experiments on a story reasoning benchmark show the positive impact of our

reliable way to collect or disseminate data across a multi-hop low-power
wireless mesh network. Recent works have shown that such protocols are
effective for narrowband communication not only over IEEE 802.15.4, but also
over the BLE 5 physical layers (PHYs). However, to date, existing literature
has only built synchronous flooding solutions on top of a single PHY, and there
has been no attempt to leverage different PHYs at runtime to increase
performance. This paper fills this gap and presents OSF, an open-source
framework that enables the design of multi-PHY synchronous flooding solutions
thanks to a novel radio driver and middle-ware architecture capable of
dynamically switching the underlying physical layer. This allows exploitation
of the specific benefits of each PHY (e.g., higher data-rate, increased
robustness) on-demand during each flood, increasing performance. We tailor OSF
to the off-the-shelf nRF52840 platform, and showcase its benefits by comparing
single-PHY and multi-PHY synchronous flooding solutions on a real-world

R* theory of resource competition predicts reversible decreases in plant

reversibility of N-induced biodiversity loss is mixed. In a long-term
N-enrichment experiment in Minnesota, a low-diversity state that emerged during
N addition has persisted for decades after additions ceased. Hypothesized
mechanisms preventing recovery of biodiversity include nutrient recycling,
insufficient external seed supply, and litter inhibition of plant growth. Here
we present an ODE model that unifies these mechanisms, produces bistability at
intermediate N inputs, and qualitatively matches the observed hysteresis at
Cedar Creek. Key features of the model, including native species' growth
advantage in low-N conditions and limitation by litter accumulation, generalize
from Cedar Creek to North American grasslands. Our results suggest that
effective biodiversity restoration in these systems may require management
beyond reducing N inputs, such as burning, grazing, haying, and seed additions.
By coupling resource competition with an additional inter-specific inhibitory
process, the model also illustrates a general mechanism for bistability and
hysteresis that may occur in multiple ecosystem types.

Introducing multiple penalized state-space models based on data-driven

column-mass density of H$_2$ projected on the sky to that of total gas (H$_2$ +

the shoulders of plateau-like distribution of H$_2$ column density from
$l=-1^\circ.1$ to $+1^\circ.8$ having Gaussian vertical distribution with a

edges of several north-trending, eastward-convex, arcuate ranges in Oz Terra,
(2) lobate ridges, lobate knob trains, and lobate aprons resembling glacial
moraine landforms on Earth, (3) dendritic channel systems containing hanging
valleys, and (4) locally striated surfaces defined by parallel ridges, knob
trains, and grooves that are > 40-50 km in length. The above observations and
the topographic dichotomy of Charon' s encountered hemisphere can be explained
by a landscape-evolution model that involves (i) a giant impact that created
the Vulcan Planitia basin and the extensional fault zone along its northern
rim, (ii) a transient atmosphere capable of driving N2-ice glacial erosion of
the water-ice bedrock and transporting water-ice debris to sedimentary basins,
(iii) regional glacial erosion and transport of earlier emplaced impact ejecta
deposits from the highlands of Oz Terra into the lowland basin of Vulcan
Planitia, (iv) syn-glaciation north-trending thrusting interpreted to have been
induced by Charon' s despinning, and (v) the development of a water-ice debris
cover layer over subsurface N2 ice below Vulcan Planitia during global
deglaciation. The infilling of the Vulcan Planitia could have been accompanied
by cryovolcanism. The extensive modification of impact craters means that the
crater size-frequency distributions from Charon should serve only as a lower

where devices, given as a Poisson point process, move in an environment, given
by a street system of random planar-tessellation type, via a random-waypoint
model. Every device independently picks a target location on the street system
using a general waypoint kernel, and travels to the target along the shortest
path on the streets with an individual velocity. Then, any pair of devices
becomes connected whenever they are on the same street in sufficiently close

properties of the multi-parameter system, we focus on an analysis of the
clustering behavior of the random connectivity graph. In our main results we
isolate regimes for the almost-sure absence of percolation if, for example, the
device intensity is too small, or the connectivity time is too large. On the
other hand, we exhibit parameter regimes of sufficiently large intensities of
devices, under favorable choices of the other parameters, such that percolation
is possible with positive probability. Most interestingly, we also show an
in-and-out of percolation as the velocity increases. The rigorous analysis of
the system mainly rests on comparison arguments with simplified models via
spatial coarse graining and thinning approaches. Here we also make contact to
geostatistical percolation models with infinite-range dependencies.

low-complexity development of neural network (NN) based equalizers for the
mitigation of impairments in high-speed coherent optical transmission systems.
In this work, we provide a comprehensive description and comparison of various
deep model compression approaches that have been applied to feed-forward and
recurrent NN designs. Additionally, we evaluate the influence these strategies
have on the performance of each NN equalizer. Quantization, weight clustering,
pruning, and other cutting-edge strategies for model compression are taken into
consideration. In this work, we propose and evaluate a Bayesian
optimization-assisted compression, in which the hyperparameters of the
compression are chosen to simultaneously reduce complexity and improve
performance. In conclusion, the trade-off between the complexity of each
compression approach and its performance is evaluated by utilizing both
simulated and experimental data in order to complete the analysis. By utilizing
optimal compression approaches, we show that it is possible to design an
NN-based equalizer that is simpler to implement and has better performance than
the conventional digital back-propagation (DBP) equalizer with only one step
per span. This is accomplished by reducing the number of multipliers used in
the NN equalizer after applying the weighted clustering and pruning algorithms.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that an equalizer based on NN can also achieve
superior performance while still maintaining the same degree of complexity as
the full electronic chromatic dispersion compensation block. We conclude our
analysis by highlighting open questions and existing challenges, as well as
possible future research directions.

significant challenges including inter-modality misalignment and finding
optimal methods to integrate information from different modalities.
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of multi-modality imaging
in cardiology, the computing methods, the validation strategies, the related
clinical workflows and future perspectives. For the computing methodologies, we
have a favored focus on the three tasks, i.e., registration, fusion and

information across modalities}. The review highlights that multi-modality
cardiac imaging data has the potential of wide applicability in the clinic,

Nevertheless, many challenges remain unsolved, such as missing modality,
combination of imaging and non-imaging data, and uniform analysis and
representation of different modalities. There is also work to do in defining
how the well-developed techniques fit in clinical workflows and how much
additional and relevant information they introduce. These problems are likely

means for UDA, involving an iterative process of predicting the target domain

However, the pseudo-labels are usually unreliable, thus easily leading to
deviated solutions with propagated errors. In this paper, we resort to the

additional regularization or an energy-based loss. This framework allows us to
gain the benefits of the energy-based model, while retaining strong

(1) model performance varies greatly depending on which speaker is selected for

comparable not only to the average WER over multiple random splits but also to
any given individual random split; (3) WER is also generally comparable when
the data is split heuristically or adversarially; (4) utterance duration and

confirmed. There are currently two, viable theories of cosmology: the standard
cosmological model, and a theory due to Mordehai Milgrom called MOND. Both
theories can point to successes and failures, but only MOND has repeatedly made
novel predictions that were subsequently found to be correct. Standard-model
cosmologists, by contrast, have almost always responded to new observations in
a post-hoc manner, adjusting or augmenting their theory as needed to obtain
correspondence with the facts. I argue that these methodological differences
render a comparison of the two theories in terms of their ""truthlikeness"" or
""verisimilitude"" essentially impossible since the two groups of scientists
achieve correspondence with the facts in often very different ways, and I
suggest that a better guide to the theories' progress toward truth might be the
methodologies themselves.

nucleons. By adopting functionals with larger slope of symmetry energy $L$, the
curvature parameter $K_\mathrm{sym}$ and neutron drip density generally
increase, while the droplet size, proton number of nucleus, core-crust
transition density, and onset density of non-spherical nuclei decrease. All
functionals predict neutron stars with maximum masses exceeding the
two-solar-mass limit, while those of DD2, DD-LZ1, DD-ME2, and DDME-X predict
optimum neutron star radii according to the observational constraints.
Nevertheless, the corresponding skewness coefficients $J$ are much lager than
expected, while only the functionals MTVTC and TW99 meet the start-of-art
constraints on $J$. More accurate measurements on the radius of PSR J0740+6620

astrophysical observations. Approximate linear correlations between neutron
stars' radii at $M=1.4 M_{\odot}$ and $2 M_{\odot}$, the slope $L$ and
curvature parameter $K_\mathrm{sym}$ of symmetry energy are observed as well,
which is mainly attributed to the curvature-slope correlations in the

applications of the Chevalley-Warning and Ax-Katz Theorems, previously only
valid for $\mathbb F_p^n$, to extend with bare minimal modification to validity
for an arbitrary finite abelian $p$-group $G$. We illustrate this be giving
several examples, including a new proof of the exact value of the Davenport

(iii) a large number of test patterns. Furthermore, the most pertinent drawback
of prior detection techniques stems from an incorrect evaluation methodology,
i.e., they assume that an adversary inserts HTs randomly. Such inappropriate
adversarial assumptions enable detection techniques to claim high HT detection
accuracy, leading to a ""false sense of security."" Unfortunately, to the best of
our knowledge, despite more than a decade of research on detecting HTs inserted
during fabrication, there have been no concerted efforts to perform a
systematic evaluation of HT detection techniques.
  In this paper, we play the role of a realistic adversary and question the
efficacy of HT detection techniques by developing an automated, scalable, and
practical attack framework, ATTRITION, using reinforcement learning (RL).
ATTRITION evades eight detection techniques across two HT detection categories,
showcasing its agnostic behavior. ATTRITION achieves average attack success
rates of $47\times$ and $211\times$ compared to randomly inserted HTs against
state-of-the-art HT detection techniques. We demonstrate ATTRITION's ability to
evade detection techniques by evaluating designs ranging from the widely-used
academic suites to larger designs such as the open-source MIPS and mor1kx
processors to AES and a GPS module. Additionally, we showcase the impact of
ATTRITION-generated HTs through two case studies (privilege escalation and kill
switch) on the mor1kx processor. We envision that our work, along with our
released HT benchmarks and models, fosters the development of better HT

  in computing extreme motion statistics",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In computing ship motion statistics (e.g., exceeding probability) in an
irregular wave field, it is a common practice to represent the irregular waves
by a large number of wave groups and compute the motion statistics from the
distribution of these wave groups. While this procedure significantly reduces
the computational cost, the uncertainties introduced in this reduced-order
computation have not been quantified. In general, the representation of a
continuous wave field by separated groups loses information about wave phases,
frequency modulation and initial conditions of ship when encountering the wave
groups, among which the last one is arguably the most influential factor for
the ship motion statistics. In this paper, we test three methods to incorporate
the ship initial conditions into the computation of roll motion exceeding
probability, namely the methods of natural initial condition, pre-computed
initial condition and constant initial condition. For different input wave
spectra and ship motion dynamics (in terms of the parametric excitation level
modeled by a nonlinear roll equation), the performances of the three methods
are carefully benchmarked and the superiority of the natural initial condition
method is demonstrated. We finally show that the computation using the natural
initial condition method can be greatly accelerated through a sequential
sampling algorithm making use of the variational heteroscedastic Gaussian
process regression.

(typically top-down and bottom-up), which suffers from either strong dependence
on prior detection or highly computational redundancy during post-grouping. In
this work, we present an end-to-end multiple human parsing framework using
representative parts, termed RepParser. Different from mainstream methods,
RepParser solves the multiple human parsing in a new single-stage manner
without resorting to person detection or post-grouping.To this end, RepParser
decouples the parsing pipeline into instance-aware kernel generation and
part-aware human parsing, which are responsible for instance separation and
instance-specific part segmentation, respectively. In particular, we empower
the parsing pipeline by representative parts, since they are characterized by
instance-aware keypoints and can be utilized to dynamically parse each person
instance. Specifically, representative parts are obtained by jointly localizing
centers of instances and estimating keypoints of body part regions. After that,
we dynamically predict instance-aware convolution kernels through
representative parts, thus encoding person-part context into each kernel
responsible for casting an image feature as an instance-specific
representation.Furthermore, a multi-branch structure is adopted to divide each
instance-specific representation into several part-aware representations for
separate part segmentation.In this way, RepParser accordingly focuses on person
instances with the guidance of representative parts and directly outputs
parsing results for each person instance, thus eliminating the requirement of
the prior detection or post-grouping.Extensive experiments on two challenging
benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed RepParser is a simple yet effective
framework and achieves very competitive performance.

We define a coupled map lattice on different topologies, namely,
one-dimensional coupled map lattice, globally coupled system and small-world

In particular, synchronization is observed over a large parameter region. For
integer order coupled map lattice in one dimension, synchronized periodic
states with a period greater than one are not obtained. However, we observe
synchronized periodic states with period-3 or period-6 in one dimensional
coupled fractional maps even for a large lattice. With nonlocal coupling, the
synchronization is reached over a larger parameter regime. In all these cases,
the standard deviation decays as power-law in time with the power same as
fractional-order. The physical significance of such studies is also discussed.

preposterous property of the cube was first noted by Prince Rupert of the Rhine
in the 17th century. Surprisingly, the cube is not alone: many other polyhedra
have this property, which we call being Rupert. A concise way to express that a
polyhedron is Rupert is to find two orientations $Q$ and $Q'$ of that
polyhedron so that $\pi(Q)$ fits inside $\pi(Q')$, with $\pi$ representing the
orthogonal projection onto the $xy$-plane. Given this scheme, to bore the hole
in $Q'$ we can remove $\pi^{-1}(\pi(Q))$.
  There is an open conjecture that every convex polyhedron is Rupert. Aiming at
this conjecture, we give two sufficient conditions for a polyhedron to be
Rupert. Both conditions require the polyhedron to have a particularly simple
orientation $Q$, which we alter by a very small amount to get $Q'$ as required

a local passage. Restricting to the local case turns out to offer many valuable
simplifications. In the process of proving our main theorems, we develop a

is proposed for electro-thermal integrated energy systems, which seeks to

respectively. The leader uses real-time energy prices to guide loads to
participate in demand response, while the followers make energy plans based on

successful. In this work, we ask: can the need for large models be, at least in
part, due to the \emph{computational} limitations of the learner? Additionally,
we ask, is this situation exacerbated for \emph{robust} learning? We show that
this indeed could be the case. We show learning tasks for which computationally
bounded learners need \emph{significantly more} model parameters than what
information-theoretic learners need. Furthermore, we show that even more model
parameters could be necessary for robust learning. In particular, for
computationally bounded learners, we extend the recent result of Bubeck and
Sellke [NeurIPS'2021] which shows that robust models might need more
parameters, to the computational regime and show that bounded learners could
provably need an even larger number of parameters. Then, we address the
following related question: can we hope to remedy the situation for robust
computationally bounded learning by restricting \emph{adversaries} to also be
computationally bounded for sake of obtaining models with fewer parameters?
Here again, we show that this could be possible. Specifically, building on the
work of Garg, Jha, Mahloujifar, and Mahmoody [ALT'2020], we demonstrate a
learning task that can be learned efficiently and robustly against a
computationally bounded attacker, while to be robust against an
information-theoretic attacker requires the learner to utilize significantly
more parameters.

ultrafast timescales using optical pulses as both the signal and the control.
Limited only by material response times, these switches can operate at
terahertz speeds, essential for technology-driven applications such as
all-optical signal processing and ultrafast imaging, as well as for fundamental
studies such as frequency translation and novel optical media concepts such as
photonic time crystals. In conventional systems, the switching time is
determined by the relaxation response of a single active material, which is
challenging to adjust dynamically. This work demonstrates that the zero-to-zero
response time of an all-optical switch can instead be varied through the
combination of so-called fast and slow materials in a single device. When
probed in the epsilon-near-zero operational regime of a material with a slow
response time, namely, plasmonic titanium nitride, the switch exhibits a
relatively slow, nanosecond response time. The response time then decreases
reaching the picosecond time scale in the ENZ regime of the faster material,
namely, aluminum-doped zinc oxide. Overall, the response time of the switch is
shown to vary by two orders of magnitude in a single device and can be
selectively controlled through the interaction of the probe signal with the
constituent materials. The ability to adjust the switching speed by controlling
the light-matter interaction in a multi-material structure provides an
additional degree of freedom in all-optical switch design. Moreover, the
proposed approach utilizes slower materials that are very robust and allow to
enhance the field intensities while faster materials ensure an ultrafast
dynamic response. The proposed control of the switching time could lead to new
functionalities within key applications in multiband transmission, optical
computing, and nonlinear optics.

treatment's performance. However, precision medicine requires knowledge of

studies, such answers are not possible because the outcomes under both
experimental conditions are not jointly observed. This makes the problem of
causal inference a missing data problem. We propose to solve this problem by
imputing the individual potential outcomes under a specified partial

demonstrate in simulation that our proposed methodology yields valid inferences

posterior distribution of individual treatment effects varies with different

sensitivity of optimal treatment outcomes under different correlation

that the proposed methodology generalises to real-world data. Imputing under

Taking TAD a step further, Spatiotemporal Action Detection (SAD) has been

However, who performs the action, is generally ignored in SAD, while
identifying the actor could also be important. To this end, we propose a novel
task, Actor-identified Spatiotemporal Action Detection (ASAD), to bridge the

  In ASAD, we not only detect the spatiotemporal boundary for instance-level
action but also assign the unique ID to each actor. To approach ASAD, Multiple

elements. By using MOT, the spatiotemporal boundary of each actor is obtained

$p_\mathsf{X}$ moves away from the capacity-achieving input distributions. It
is a property of the information rate function that is particularly useful in
the study of higher order asymptotics and finite blocklength information
theory, where it was already implicitly used by Strassen [1] and later, more
explicitly, by Polyanskiy-Poor-Verd\'u [2]. However, the proofs outlined in
both works contain gaps that are nontrivial to close. This comment provides an
alternative, complete proof of this property.

  effect in cognitive psychology","submitted to Journal of Mathematical Psychology",,,,"q-bio.NC quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The aim of this paper is to promote quantum logic as one of the basic tools
for analyzing human reasoning. We compare it with classical (Boolean) logic and
highlight the role of violation of the distributive law for conjunction and
disjunction. It is well known that nondistributivity is equivalent to
incompatibility of logical variables -- the impossibility to assign jointly the
two-valued truth values to these variables. A natural question arises as to
whether quantum logical nondistributivity in human logic can be tested
experimentally. We show that testing the response replicability effect (RRE) in
cognitive psychology is equivalent to testing nondistributivity -- under the
prevailing conjecture that the mental state update generated by observation is
described as orthogonal projection of the mental state vector (the projective
update conjecture of Wang and Busemeyer). A simple test of RRE is suggested. In
contrast to the previous works in quantum-like modeling, we proceed in the
state-dependent framework; in particular, distributivity, compatibility, and
RRE are considered in a fixed mental state. In this framework, we improve the
previous result on the impossibility to combine question order and response
replicability effects by using (von Neumann-L\""uders) projective measurements.

variance of this model is bounded, uniformly over all boundary conditions (both
in terms of location and boundary heights). This implies a strong notion of
localisation, uniformly over all extremal Gibbs measures of the system. For the
second model, we consider directed trees, in which each vertex has exactly one
parent and at least two children. We consider the locally uniform law on height
functions which are monotone, that is, such that the height of the parent

classification of all extremal gradient Gibbs measures, and describe exactly
the localisation-delocalisation transition for this model. Typical extremal
gradient Gibbs measures are localised also in this case. Localisation in both

that interactions among agents are one-shot and investors do not consider the
investment environment before making decisions, which collide with many
realistic situations. In this paper, we introduce the conditional investment
strategy into the repeated N-player trust game, in which conditional investors
decide to invest or not depending on their assessment of the trustworthiness
level of the group. By using the approach of the Markov decision process, we
study the evolutionary dynamics of trust in repeated group interactions with
the conditional investment strategy. We find that conditional investors can
form an effective alliance with trustworthy trustees, hence they can sweep out
untrustworthy trustees. Moreover, we verify that such alliance can exist in a
wide range of model parameters. These results may explain why trusting in
others and reciprocating them with trustworthy actions can be sustained in game

PIONIER and GRAVITY at VLTI, or MIRC-X and MYSTIC at CHARA. While those

but relative astrometric accuracy, imaging capability, or spectral resolution.
Our goal is to build an instrument specifically designed to optimize for
sensitivity. This meant focusing our design efforts on different parts of the
instrument and investigating new technologies and techniques. First, we make
use of the low-noise C-RED One camera using e-APD technology and provided by
First Light Imaging, already used in the improvement of sensitivity in recent
new instruments. We forego the use of single-mode fibers but still favor an
image plane design that offers more sensitivity than a pupil plane layout. We
also use a minimum number of optical elements to maximize the throughput of the
design, using a long focal length cylindrical mirror. We chose to limit our
design to 3 beams, to have the capability to obtain closure phases, but not
dilute the incoming flux in more beam combinations. We also use in our design
an edge filter to have the capability to observe H- and K-band at the same

tracking but maximizing the SNR of the fringes for each spectral channel. All
these elements will lead to a typical limiting magnitude between 10 and 11 in

load to the overall system balancing, but also ensures that the load is
actually contributing to form the grid and to provide synchronization power to
the overall system. In this sense, the new concept allows running a system
powered only by renewables operating at maximum power (or operator defined
set-point) in grid-following mode, while the overall system control is ubicated
in the demand side. This is an important change of paradigm as it considers
that all the flexibility, synchronism and stability provision is on the demand
side. This concept can applied either to isolated systems or also to future
power systems, where millions of loads steer the power system while the
renewables are operating at full power. The paper proposes the concept,
suggests possible control implementations of the grid-forming load and analyses
the concept in four simulation case studies.

paradigm for lifelong learning based on meta-learning and associative mechanism
of the brain. It tackles the problem from two aspects: extracting knowledge and
memorizing knowledge. First, we disrupt the sample's background distribution
through a background attack, which strengthens the model to extract the key
features of each task. Second, according to the similarity between incremental
knowledge and base knowledge, we design an adaptive fusion of incremental
knowledge, which helps the model allocate capacity to the knowledge of
different difficulties. It is theoretically analyzed that the proposed learning

The proposed method is validated on the MNIST, CIFAR100, CUB200 and ImageNet100

[1-11]-oriented W nanowires with (121) twin planes and free of dislocations

nanowires. The fracture strength of the twinned W nanowire was 13.7 GPa, 16%
lower than that of the single-crystal W nanowire (16.3 GPa). The weakening
mechanism of the TB was revealed by a combination of atomic-resolution
characterizations and atomistic simulations. Twinned W nanowires failed by the
early nucleation of a crack at the intersection of the TB with the surface. The
standard strengthening mechanism by dislocation/TB interaction was not
operative in W because the high Peierls barrier and stacking fault energy in W
hinder dislocation nucleation and glide. These findings provide a new insight
into the influence of TBs on the mechanical properties of BCC metals.

CIM-SR-DCSK-CC system, the source transmits information bits to both the relay

source information bits but also sends new information bits to the destination
in the second time slot. To be specific, the relay employs an $N$-order Walsh
code to carry additional ${{\log }_{2}}N$ information bits, which are
superimposed onto the SR-DCSK signal carrying the decoded source information
bits. Subsequently, the superimposed signal carrying both the source and relay
information bits is transmitted to the destination. Moreover, the theoretical
bit error rate (BER) expressions of the proposed CIM-SR-DCSK-CC system are
derived over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading
channels. Compared with the conventional DCSK-CC system and SR-DCSK-CC system,
the proposed CIM-SR-DCSK-CC system can significantly improve the throughput
without deteriorating any BER performance. As a consequence, the proposed

promote the evolution of cooperation. In real society, the way in which social
exclusion works can be direct or indirect. However, thus far there is no
related work to explore how indirect exclusion influences the evolution of
cooperation from a theoretical perspective. Here, we introduce indirect
exclusion into the repeated public goods game where the game organizer
probabilistically selects cooperators after the first game round to participate
in the following possible game interactions. We then investigate the
evolutionary dynamics of cooperation both in infinite and finite well-mixed
populations. Through theoretical analysis and numerical calculations, we find
that the introduction of indirect exclusion can induce the stable coexistence
of cooperators and defectors or the dominance of cooperators, which thus
effectively promotes the evolution of cooperation. Besides, we show that the
identifying probability of the organizer has a nonlinear effect on public
cooperation when its value is lower than an intermediate value, while the
higher identifying probability can maintain a high level of cooperation.
Furthermore, our results show that increasing the average rounds of game
interactions can effectively promote the evolution of cooperation.

latency as RDMA enables fast data accesses. However, the single index structure
used in existing RDMA-based key-value stores, either hash-based or sorted
index, fails to support range queries efficiently while achieving high
performance for single-point operations. In this paper, we reconsider the
adoption of hybrid index in the key-value stores based on RDMA, to combine the
benefits of hash table and sorted index. We propose HiStore, an RDMA-based
key-value store using hash table for single-point lookups and leveraging
skiplist for range queries. To maintain strong consistency in a lightweight and
efficient approach, HiStore introduces index groups where a skiplist
corresponds to a hash table, and asynchronously applies updates to the skiplist
within a group. Guided by previous work on using RDMA for key-value services,
HiStore dedicatedly chooses different RDMA primitives to optimize the read and
write performance. Furthermore, HiStore tolerates the failures of servers that
maintain index structures with index replication for high availability. Our
evaluation results demonstrate that HiStore improves the performance of both
GET and SCAN operations (by up to 2.03x) with hybrid index.

quantum information processing and single qubit manipulation. Here, we propose
an approach to realize strong spin-magnon coupling in a hybrid optomechanical
cavity-spin-magnon system, where the optomechanical system, consisting of two
cavities coupled to a common high-frequency mechanical resonator, acts as
quantum interface. By eliminating the mechanical mode, a position-position
coupling and two-mode squeezing of two cavities are induced. In the squeezing
presentation, the spin-photon, magnon-photon and photon-photon coupling
strengths are exponentially amplified, thus lower- and upper-branch polaritons
(LBP and UBP) are generated by strongly coupled squeezed modes of two cavities.
Utilizing the critical property of the LBP, the coupling between the spin qubit
(magnon) and LBP is greatly enhanced, while the coupling between the spin qubit
(magnon) and UBP is fully suppressed. In the dispersive regime, strong and
tunable spin-magnon coupling is induced by the virtual LBP, allowing quantum
state exchange between them. Our proposal provides a promising platform to
construct magnon-based hybrid systems and realize solid-state quantum
information processing with optomechanical interfaces.

beyond-LCDM models which introduce additional energy density with significant
pressure support, such as early dark energy (EDE) or additional neutrino energy
density ($\Delta N_{\rm eff}$), lead to larger values of $H_0$. On the other
hand, models which only affect the time of recombination, such as a varying
electron mass ($\Delta m_e$), produce $H_0$ constraints similar to LCDM. Using
BOSS data, constraints from light element abundances, cosmic microwave
background (CMB) lensing, a CMB-based prior on the scalar amplitude ($A_s$),
spectral index ($n_s$), and $\Omega_m$ from the Pantheon+ supernovae data set,

$\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, $H_0=68.1^{+2.7}_{-3.8}$; $\Delta m_e$,
$H_0=64.7^{+1.9}_{-2.3}$. Using a prior on $\Omega_m$ from uncalibrated BAO and

$H_0=72.6^{+2.8}_{-3.7}$; $\Delta m_e$, $H_0=68.8\pm 1.9$. With current data,
none of the models are in significant tension with SH0ES, and consistency tests

  Methods: Building on model-based nonlinear and linear subspace techniques

latent representations. The proposed Latent Signal Model framework inserts the
decoder portion of the auto-encoder into the forward model and directly

  Results: An auto-encoder with one real latent variable represents FSE, EPTI,

networks, called neural observer, for observation tasks of linear
time-invariant (LTI) systems and uncertain nonlinear systems. In particular,
the neural observer designed for uncertain systems is inspired by the active
disturbance rejection control, which can measure the uncertainty in real-time.
The stability analysis (e.g., exponential convergence rate) of LTI and
uncertain nonlinear systems (involving neural observers) are presented and
guaranteed, where it is shown that the observation problems can be solved only
using the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Also, it is revealed that the
observability and controllability of the system matrices are required to
demonstrate the existence of solutions of LMIs. Finally, the effectiveness of
neural observers is verified on three simulation cases, including the X-29A
aircraft model, the nonlinear pendulum, and the four-wheel steering vehicle.

users by understanding their successive historical behaviors. Recently, some
methods for SR are devoted to alleviating the data sparsity problem (i.e.,
limited supervised signals for training), which take account of contrastive
learning to incorporate self-supervised signals into SR. Despite their
achievements, it is far from enough to learn informative user/item embeddings
due to the inadequacy modeling of complex collaborative information and
co-action information, such as user-item relation, user-user relation, and
item-item relation. In this paper, we study the problem of SR and propose a
novel multi-level contrastive learning framework for sequential recommendation,
named MCLSR. Different from the previous contrastive learning-based methods for
SR, MCLSR learns the representations of users and items through a cross-view
contrastive learning paradigm from four specific views at two different levels
(i.e., interest- and feature-level). Specifically, the interest-level
contrastive mechanism jointly learns the collaborative information with the
sequential transition patterns, and the feature-level contrastive mechanism
re-observes the relation between users and items via capturing the co-action
information (i.e., co-occurrence). Extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets show that the proposed MCLSR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
consistently.

determines the prosperity and stability of a country. As time passing, the
fluctuations of firm employment can reflect the process of creating or

employment (size) dynamics. Drawing on the firm-level panel data extracted from
the Chinese Industrial Enterprises Database 1998-2013, this paper proposes a
Markov-chain-based descriptive approach to clearly demonstrate the firm size
transfer dynamics between different size categories. With this method, any firm
size transition path in a short time period can be intuitively demonstrated.
Furthermore, by utilizing the properties of Markov transfer matrices, the
definition of transition trend and the transition entropy are introduced and
estimated. As a result, the tendency of firm size transfer between small,
medium and large can be exactly revealed, and the uncertainty of size change
can be quantified. Generally from the evidence of this paper, it can be
inferred that small and medium manufacturing firms in China have greater job
creation potentials compared to large firms over this time period.

a spanning tree in $G$, such that for each $\left\lbrace e_i, e_j \right\rbrace

on Lagrangean algorithms to the NP-hard problem of finding minimum weight
stable spanning trees is limited to relaxations with the integrality property.
We exploit a new relaxation of this problem: fixed cardinality stable sets in
the underlying conflict graph $H =(E,C)$. We find interesting properties of the
corresponding polytope, and determine stronger dual bounds in a Lagrangean
decomposition framework, optimizing over the spanning tree polytope of $G$ and
the fixed cardinality stable set polytope of $H$ in the subproblems. This is
equivalent to dualizing exponentially many subtour elimination constraints,
while limiting the number of multipliers in the dual problem to $|E|$. It is
also a proof of concept for combining Lagrangean relaxation with the power of
MILP solvers over strongly NP-hard subproblems. We present encouraging
computational results using a dual method that comprises the Volume Algorithm,
initialized with multipliers determined by Lagrangean dual-ascent. In
particular, the bound is within 5.5% of the optimum in 146 out of 200 benchmark

which transfers arbitrary visual styles to content images. However, existing
approaches suffer from the aesthetic-unrealistic problem that introduces
disharmonious patterns and evident artifacts, making the results easy to spot
from real paintings. To address this limitation, we propose AesUST, a novel
Aesthetic-enhanced Universal Style Transfer approach that can generate
aesthetically more realistic and pleasing results for arbitrary styles.
Specifically, our approach introduces an aesthetic discriminator to learn the
universal human-delightful aesthetic features from a large corpus of
artist-created paintings. Then, the aesthetic features are incorporated to
enhance the style transfer process via a novel Aesthetic-aware Style-Attention
(AesSA) module. Such an AesSA module enables our AesUST to efficiently and
flexibly integrate the style patterns according to the global aesthetic channel
distribution of the style image and the local semantic spatial distribution of
the content image. Moreover, we also develop a new two-stage transfer training
strategy with two aesthetic regularizations to train our model more
effectively, further improving stylization performance. Extensive experiments
and user studies demonstrate that our approach synthesizes aesthetically more
harmonious and realistic results than state of the art, greatly narrowing the
disparity with real artist-created paintings. Our code is available at

minimize the maximum column weight of each layer while maintaining a block
cyclic shift property among different layers. As a result, we derive all the
feasible solutions for the problem and propose a tight lower bound
$\omega_{LB}$ on the minimum possible maximum column weight to evaluate a
solution. Second, we define a metric called layer distance to measure the data
dependency between consecutive layers and further illustrate how to identify
the solutions with desired layer distance from those achieving the minimum
value of $\omega_{LB}=1$, which is preferred to reduce computation delay. Next,
we demonstrate that up-to-now, finding an optimal solution for the optimization
problem with polynomial time complexity is unachievable. Therefore, both
enumerative and greedy partition algorithms are proposed instead. After that,
we modify the quasi-cyclic progressive edge-growth (QC-PEG) algorithm to
directly construct PCMs that have a straightforward partition scheme to achieve
$\omega_{LB} $ or the desired layer distance. Simulation results showed that
the constructed codes have better error correction performance and smaller

convectively-driven turbulent flow using direct numerical simulation (DNS). The
aim of our study is to develop a simple stochastic model that can accurately
describe the residence times of the particles in the flow, this time being
determined by the complex competition between the gravitational settling of the
particles, and the interaction of the particles with the turbulent structures
in the flow. A simple conceptual picture underlies the stochastic model, namely
that the particles take repeated trips between the top and bottom boundaries,
driven by the convective cells that occur in Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard turbulence,
and that their residence times are determined by the time it takes to complete
one of these trips, which varies from one trip to another, and the probability
of falling out to the bottom boundary after each trip. Despite the simplicity
of the model, it yields quantitatively accurate predictions of the distribution
of the particle residence times in the flow. We independently vary the Stokes
numbers and settling velocities in order to shed light on the independent roles

including black-box attacks, where malicious participants can recover arbitrary

optimization, where we establish a trade-off between the latency of
co-inference and the privacy-level of data. Next, to relax the optimal

removal models. We present a novel lightweight deep neural network that
processes shadow images in the LAB color space. The proposed network termed
""LAB-Net"", is motivated by the following three observations: First, the LAB
color space can well separate the luminance information and color properties.
Second, sequentially-stacked convolutional layers fail to take full use of
features from different receptive fields. Third, non-shadow regions are
important prior knowledge to diminish the drastic color difference between
shadow and non-shadow regions. Consequently, we design our LAB-Net by involving
a two-branch structure: L and AB branches. Thus the shadow-related luminance
information can well be processed in the L branch, while the color property is
well retained in the AB branch. In addition, each branch is composed of several
Basic Blocks, local spatial attention modules (LSA), and convolutional filters.
Each Basic Block consists of multiple parallelized dilated convolutions of
divergent dilation rates to receive different receptive fields that are
operated with distinct network widths to save model parameters and
computational costs. Then, an enhanced channel attention module (ECA) is
constructed to aggregate features from different receptive fields for better
shadow removal. Finally, the LSA modules are further developed to fully use the
prior information in non-shadow regions to cleanse the shadow regions. We
perform extensive experiments on the both ISTD and SRD datasets. Experimental
results show that our LAB-Net well outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Also,
our model's parameters and computational costs are reduced by several orders of

including rare disease prediction, ecological resource management, fraud
detection, and material property optimization. A Needle-in-a-Haystack problem
arises when there is an extreme imbalance of optimum conditions relative to the
size of the dataset. For example, only $0.82\%$ out of $146$k total materials
in the open-access Materials Project database have a negative Poisson's ratio.
However, current state-of-the-art optimization algorithms are not designed with
the capabilities to find solutions to these challenging multidimensional
Needle-in-a-Haystack problems, resulting in slow convergence to a global
optimum or pigeonholing into a local minimum. In this paper, we present a
Zooming Memory-Based Initialization algorithm, entitled ZoMBI. ZoMBI actively
extracts knowledge from the previously best-performing evaluated experiments to
iteratively zoom in the sampling search bounds towards the global optimum
""needle"" and then prunes the memory of low-performing historical experiments to
accelerate compute times by reducing the algorithm time complexity from
$O(n^3)$ to $O(\phi^3)$ for $\phi$ forward experiments per activation, which
trends to a constant $O(1)$ over several activations. Additionally, ZoMBI
implements two custom adaptive acquisition functions to further guide the
sampling of new experiments toward the global optimum. We validate the
algorithm's optimization performance on three real-world datasets exhibiting
Needle-in-a-Haystack and further stress-test the algorithm's performance on an
additional 174 analytical datasets. The ZoMBI algorithm demonstrates compute
time speed-ups of 400x compared to traditional Bayesian optimization as well as
efficiently discovering optima in under 100 experiments that are up to 3x more

molecules is a central theme in chemical physics. Molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation is the primary tool for the study of transition processes in
biomolecules, but it is hampered by a huge timescale gap between the processes
of interest and atomic vibrations which dictate the time step size. Therefore,
it is imperative to combine MD simulations with other techniques in order to
quantify the transition processes taking place on large timescales. In this
work, the diffusion map with Mahalanobis kernel, a meshless approach for
approximating the Backward Kolmogorov Operator (BKO) in collective variables,
is upgraded to incorporate standard enhanced sampling techniques such as
metadynamics. The resulting algorithm, which we call the ""target measure
Mahalanobis diffusion map"" (tm-mmap), is suitable for a moderate number of
collective variables in which one can approximate the diffusion tensor and free
energy. Imposing appropriate boundary conditions allows use of the approximated
BKO to solve for the committor function and utilization of transition path
theory to find the reactive current delineating the transition channels and the

  arXiv:1804.01394",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We address a long-standing criticism of the stochastic mechanics approach to
quantum theory by one of its pioneers, Edward Nelson: multi-time correlations
in stochastic mechanics differ from those in textbook quantum theory. We
elaborate upon an answer to this criticism by Blanchard et al. (1986), who
showed that if the (derived) wave function in stochastic mechanics is assumed
to collapse to a delta function in a position measurement, the collapse will
change the stochastic process for the particles (because the stochastic process
depends on derivatives of the wave function), and the resulting multi-time
correlations will agree with those in textbook quantum theory. We show that
this assumption can be made rigorous through the tool of `effective collapse'
familiar from pilot-wave theories, and we illustrate this with an example
involving the double-slit experiment. We also show that in the case of
multi-time correlations between multiple particles, effective collapse implies
nonlocal influences between particles. Hence one of the major lingering
objections to stochastic mechanics is dissolved.

mining. It aims to discover itemsets that have high relative utility in their
selling time period. Compared with traditional utility mining, OSUM can find
more practical and meaningful patterns in real-life applications. However,
there is a major drawback to traditional OSUM. For normal users, it is hard to
define a minimum threshold minutil for mining the right amount of on-shelf high
utility itemsets. On one hand, if the threshold is set too high, the number of
patterns would not be enough. On the other hand, if the threshold is set too
low, too many patterns will be discovered and cause an unnecessary waste of
time and memory consumption. To address this issue, the user usually directly
specifies a parameter k, where only the top-k high relative utility itemsets
would be considered. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a generic algorithm
named TOIT for mining Top-k On-shelf hIgh-utility paTterns to solve this
problem. TOIT applies a novel strategy to raise the minutil based on the
on-shelf datasets. Besides, two novel upper-bound strategies named subtree
utility and local utility are applied to prune the search space. By adopting
the strategies mentioned above, the TOIT algorithm can narrow the search space
as early as possible, improve the mining efficiency, and reduce the memory
consumption, so it can obtain better performance than other algorithms. A
series of experiments have been conducted on real datasets with different
styles to compare the effects with the state-of-the-art KOSHU algorithm. The
experimental results showed that TOIT outperforms KOSHU in both running time
and memory consumption.

perform effective activity classification on other datasets (successive to a
small amount of fine-tuning). To tackle this problem, we design our solution
with the intention of learning as much information from the accelerometer

learns the data in time-frequency domain, and the other in time-domain alone.
In order to address the issues mentioned above in regards to cross-dataset
transfer learning, we use self-supervised contrastive learning to train each of
these streams. Next, each stream is fine-tuned for final classification, and
eventually the two are fused to provide the final results. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed solution on three datasets, namely MotionSense,
HAPT, and HHAR, and demonstrate that our solution outperforms prior works in
this field. We further evaluate the performance of the method in learning
generalized features, by using MobiAct dataset for pre-training and the
remaining three datasets for the downstream classification task, and show that
the proposed solution achieves better performance in comparison with other
self-supervised methods in cross-dataset transfer learning.

whether or not the Maxwell--Chern--Simons electrodynamics could influence

offices, and encourages companies to open more opportunities that allow
employees to work from a remote location. As the workplace type expands from
onsite offices to remote areas, an emerging challenge for an online hiring
marketplace is how these remote opportunities and user intentions to work
remotely can be modeled and matched without prior information. Despite the
unprecedented amount of remote jobs posted amid COVID-19, there is no existing
approach that can be directly applied.
  Introducing a brand new workplace type naturally leads to the cold-start
problem, which is particularly more common for less active job seekers. It is
challenging, if not impossible, to onboard a new workplace type for any
predictive model if existing information sources can provide little information
related to a new category of jobs, including data from resumes and job
descriptions. Hence, in this work, we aim to propose a principled approach that
jointly models the remoteness of job seekers and job opportunities with limited
information, which also suffices the needs of web-scale applications. Existing
research on the emerging type of remote workplace mainly focuses on qualitative
studies, and classic predictive modeling approaches are inapplicable
considering the problem of cold-start and information scarcity. We precisely
try to close this gap with a novel graph neural architecture. Extensive
experiments on large-scale data from real-world applications have been
conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed approach over competitive
baselines. The improvement may translate to more rapid onboarding of the new
