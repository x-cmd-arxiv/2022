biosignature pair for the atmospheric characterization of terrestrial
exoplanets. In circumstances when O2 may not be detectable in a planetary
atmosphere (e.g., at mid-IR wavelengths) it has been suggested that ozone (O3),
the photochemical product of O2, could be used as a proxy to infer the presence
of O2. However, O3 production has a nonlinear dependence on O2 and is strongly
influenced by the UV spectrum of the host star. To evaluate the reliability of
O3 as a proxy for O2, we used Atmos, a 1D coupled climate/photochemistry code,
to study the O2-O3 relationship for ""Earth-like"" habitable zone planets around
a variety of stellar hosts (G0V-M5V) and O2 abundances. Overall, we found that
the O2-O3 relationship differed significantly with stellar hosts and resulted
in different trends for hotter stars (G0V-K2V) vs cooler stars (K5V-M5V).
Planets orbiting hotter host stars counter-intuitively experience an increase
in O3 when O2 levels are initially decreased from 100% Earth's present
atmospheric level (PAL), with a maximum O3 abundance occurring at 25-55% PAL
O2. As O2 abundance initially decreases, larger amounts of UV photons capable
of O2 photolysis reach the lower (denser) regions of the atmosphere where O3
production is more efficient, resulting in these increased O3 levels. This
effect does not occur for cooler host stars (K5V-M5V), as the weaker incident
UV flux does not allow O3 formation to occur at dense enough regions of the
atmosphere where the faster O3 production can outweigh a smaller source of O2
from which to create O3. Overall it will be extremely difficult (or impossible)
to infer precise O2 levels from an O3 measurement, however, with information
about the UV spectrum of the host star and context clues, O3 will provide
valuable information about potential surface habitability of an exoplanet.

data with text and image, previous approaches do not make full use of the
fine-grained semantics of the image, especially in conjunction with the
semantics of the text and do not fully consider modeling the relationship
between fine-grained image information and target, which leads to insufficient
use of image and inadequate to identify fine-grained aspects and opinions. To
tackle these limitations, we propose a new framework SeqCSG including a method
to construct sequential cross-modal semantic graphs and an encoder-decoder
model. Specifically, we extract fine-grained information from the original
image, image caption, and scene graph, and regard them as elements of the
cross-modal semantic graph as well as tokens from texts. The cross-modal
semantic graph is represented as a sequence with a multi-modal visible matrix
indicating relationships between elements. In order to effectively utilize the
cross-modal semantic graph, we propose an encoder-decoder method with a target
prompt template. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms
existing methods and achieves the state-of-the-art on two standard datasets

ferromagnetic finite-size ground state evolves towards a paramagnet as disorder

vaccine effectiveness: the obvious crude method comparing rate testing positive
per head of vaccinated population with that rate per head of unvaccinated

give very different results. We want to know whether either method is reliable.
  We assume either a homogeneous population or one partitioned into two
homogeneous subsets which differ only in their not-directly-observable
healthcare-seeking behaviour including probability of getting vaccinated. We
first consider uniform independent priors on the probabilities of being
hospitalised conditional on subset, vaccination status, and infection status.
We simulate from the resulting model and observe the TNCC estimate, the crude
estimate, and the Bayesian central 95% confidence interval on vaccine
effectiveness represented as log ratio of odds ratios for infection with and
without vaccination.
  With these wide open priors, even when the population is homogeneous, the
Bayesian 95% confidence interval typically has a width of nearly 4 nats
(55-fold), implying too much uncertainty for the data collected to be of any
use in monitoring effectiveness. There do exist some tight priors under which
the data is useful: some lead to TNCC being more accurate while with others the
crude estimate is more accurate.
  Thus using only data from those spontaneously choosing to be tested, we find
that neither method is reliably better than the other, and indeed that the
desired information is not present in this data. We conclude that effective
monitoring of vaccine effectiveness and side-effects requires either strong
information on the population's behaviour, or ongoing randomised controlled

to the case of a mesh which is not body-fitted to the valves. We test the
proposed method on two different benchmark problems, including a new simplified

the birth and survival transition rules are 9-bits apiece. Inspired by Life,
several projects have developed continuously-valued cellular automata
frameworks in 2 dimensions. These CA systems are necessarily imperfect
approximations of ideal continuous systems when they are implemented in a
digital computer, and this inevitably leads to discretization errors. As we
know since at least the time of Poincair\'e's work on the three-body problem,
arbitrarily small errors in a complex dynamic system can lead to substantial
behavioral deviation over time.
  This outline of intent is based on observations in cellular automata that, in

self-organization.

many applications including autonomous driving, robotic grasping and augmented
reality. Existing leading methods tend to estimate the depth of the input image
first, and detect the 3D object based on point cloud. This routine suffers from
the inherent gap between depth estimation and object detection. Besides, the
prediction error accumulation would also affect the performance. In this paper,
a novel method named MonoSIM is proposed. The insight behind introducing
MonoSIM is that we propose to simulate the feature learning behaviors of a
point cloud based detector for monocular detector during the training period.
Hence, during inference period, the learned features and prediction would be
similar to the point cloud based detector as possible. To achieve it, we
propose one scene-level simulation module, one RoI-level simulation module and
one response-level simulation module, which are progressively used for the
detector's full feature learning and prediction pipeline. We apply our method
to the famous M3D-RPN detector and CaDDN detector, conducting extensive
experiments on KITTI and Waymo Open datasets. Results show that our method
consistently improves the performance of different monocular detectors for a
large margin without changing their network architectures. Our codes will be

justify a near-linear time complexity for the neighbor search in the sizes of
Q,R.
  Section 5.3 of Curtin's PhD (2015) pointed out that the proof of this result
was wrong. The key step in the original proof attempted to show that the number
of iterations can be estimated by multiplying the length of the longest
root-to-leaf path in a cover tree by a constant factor. However, this estimate
can miss many potential nodes in several branches of a cover tree, that should
be considered during the neighbor search. The same argument was unfortunately
repeated in several subsequent papers using cover trees from 2006.
  This paper explicitly constructs challenging datasets that provide
counterexamples to the past proofs of time complexity for the cover tree
construction, the k-nearest neighbor search presented at ICML 2006, and the

We show that this type of reaction term generates many interesting differences

can either perish or thrive, even if it starts from the same initial data,
depending on its initial pressure configuration. When the initial pressure is a
characteristic function, we establish the existence of the sharp threshold
separating the two behaviors. Lastly we present a detailed analysis of the

research has been studying the complexities of LCL problems on paths/cycles,

model of distributed computing. In this work, we initiate the study of LCL
problems in the low-space Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model. In
particular, on forests, we provide a method that, given the complexity of an
LCL problem in the LOCAL model, automatically provides an exponentially faster
algorithm for the low-space MPC setting that uses optimal global memory, that
is, truly linear.
  While restricting to forests may seem to weaken the result, we emphasize that
all known (conditional) lower bounds for the MPC setting are obtained by
lifting lower bounds obtained in the distributed setting in tree-like networks
(either forests or high girth graphs), and hence the problems that we study are
challenging already on forests. Moreover, the most important technical feature
of our algorithms is that they use optimal global memory, that is, memory
linear in the number of edges of the graph. In contrast, most of the
state-of-the-art algorithms use more than linear global memory. Further, they
typically start with a dense graph, sparsify it, and then solve the problem on
the residual graph, exploiting the relative increase in global memory. On
forests, this is not possible, because the given graph is already as sparse as
it can be, and using optimal memory requires new solutions.

final states of the gamma transition are low-lying surface vibrational states.
We demonstrate the theory by performing numerical calculation for the reaction
$^{139}{\rm Sn} (n,\gamma) ^{140}{\rm Sn}$. We discuss various new features
which are beyond the single-particle model; presence of narrow and wide
resonances originating from non-collective and collective excitations and roles
of low-lying quadrupole and octupole vibrational states.

modeling and forecasting energy behavior in buildings because given enough
data, they are good at finding spatiotemporal patterns and structures even in
scenarios where the complexity prohibits analytical descriptions. However,
their architecture typically does not hold physical correspondence to
mechanistic structures linked with governing physical phenomena. As a result,
their ability to successfully generalize for unobserved timesteps depends on
the representativeness of the dynamics underlying the observed system in the
data, which is difficult to guarantee in real-world engineering problems such
as control and energy management in digital twins. In response, we present a
framework that combines lumped-parameter models in the form of linear
time-invariant (LTI) state-space models (SSMs) with unsupervised reduced-order
modeling in a subspace-based domain adaptation (SDA) framework. SDA is a type
of transfer-learning (TL) technique, typically adopted for exploiting labeled
data from one domain to predict in a different but related target domain for
which labeled data is limited. We introduce a novel SDA approach where instead
of labeled data, we leverage the geometric structure of the LTI SSM governed by
well-known heat transfer ordinary differential equations to forecast for
unobserved timesteps beyond observed measurement data. Fundamentally, our
approach geometrically aligns the physics-derived and data-derived embedded
subspaces closer together. In this initial exploration, we evaluate the
physics-based SDA framework on a demonstrative heat conduction scenario by
varying the thermophysical properties of the source and target systems to
demonstrate the transferability of mechanistic models from a physics-based
domain to a data domain.

between reduced density matrices at zero temperature. Both thermal and reduced
fidelities can detect the quantum phase transition of the XX spin chain.
Moreover, we argue that symmetry-resolved fidelities are sensitive to the inner
structure of the states. In particular, they can detect the phase transition
through the reorganisation of the charge sectors at the critical point. This a
main feature of symmetry-resolved fidelities which we expect to be general. We
also highlight that reduced fidelities can detect quantum phase transitions in

parameter dependence of superdiffusion for the map lifted periodically onto the
real line. From numerical simulations we compute the generalised diffusion
coefficient (GDC) of this model as a function of the map's nonlinearity
parameter. We identify two singular dynamical transitions in the GDC, one where
it diverges to infinity, and a second one where it is fully suppressed. Using
the continuous-time random walk theory of L\'evy walks we calculate an analytic
expression for the GDC and show that it qualitatively reproduces these two
transitions. Quantitatively it systematically deviates from the deterministic
dynamics for small parameter values, which we explain by slow decay of velocity
correlations. Interestingly, imposing aging onto the dynamics in simulations
eliminates the dynamical transition that led to suppression of the GDC, thus
yielding a non-trivial change in the parameter dependence of superdiffusion.
This also applies to a respective intermittent model of subdiffusive dynamics

motion of objects by isolating and estimating the 3D object motion in the past
frames and then extrapolating it. We employ multi-plane images (MPI) as a 3D
representation of the scenes and model the object motion as the 3D displacement
between the corresponding points in the MPI representation. In order to handle
the sparsity in MPIs while estimating the motion, we incorporate partial
convolutions and masked correlation layers to estimate corresponding points.
The predicted object motion is then integrated with the given user or camera
motion to generate the next frame. Using a disocclusion infilling module, we
synthesize the regions uncovered due to the camera and object motion. We
develop a new synthetic dataset for TVS of dynamic scenes consisting of 800

task, where an input word sequence containing grammatical errors, is corrected
for these errors by the GEC system to output a grammatically correct word
sequence. With the advent of deep learning methods, automated GEC systems have
become increasingly popular. For example, GEC systems are often used on speech
transcriptions of English learners as a form of assessment and feedback - these
powerful GEC systems can be used to automatically measure an aspect of a
candidate's fluency. The count of \textit{edits} from a candidate's input
sentence (or essay) to a GEC system's grammatically corrected output sentence
is indicative of a candidate's language ability, where fewer edits suggest
better fluency. The count of edits can thus be viewed as a \textit{fluency
score} with zero implying perfect fluency. However, although deep learning
based GEC systems are extremely powerful and accurate, they are susceptible to
adversarial attacks: an adversary can introduce a small, specific change at the
input of a system that causes a large, undesired change at the output. When
considering the application of GEC systems to automated language assessment,
the aim of an adversary could be to cheat by making a small change to a
grammatically incorrect input sentence that conceals the errors from a GEC
system, such that no edits are found and the candidate is unjustly awarded a
perfect fluency score. This work examines a simple universal substitution
adversarial attack that non-native speakers of English could realistically
employ to deceive GEC systems used for assessment.

attributed to the step-edge guided nucleation caused by reducing the

simulations forced with the SSP3-7.0 scenario and train a fully connected NN to
predict the ensemble- and global-mean temperature (i.e., the forced global
warming signal) given an annual temperature map from an individual ensemble
member. We then use various XAI methods and different baselines to attribute
the network predictions to the input. We show that attributions differ
substantially when considering different baselines, as they correspond to
answering different science questions. We conclude by discussing some important

on using arithmetic homotopy to make the production of Poincare; series
attached to general diophantine statements canonical.
  According to work in progress of Michael Benedikt and E. Hrushovski, Galois
stratification - over one finite field - is as efficient as is possible: on a
statement of length n, it requires time bounded by a stack of exponentials of
length linear in n. This doesn't take advantage of problems prepped for using
homotopy aspects, Chow Motives, efficiently as in the main example which comes
from my paper on the generalization of exceptional covers.
  That example [FrJ, Chap. 30], simplifies aspects of the original procedure.
It combines this with the later theory of Frobenius fields to produce objects
over Q whose reductions mod primes give the stratification procedure at the
prime. The paper separates two different uses of the Chebotarev non-regular
analog.
  1. Field crossing to interpret Poincare series coefficients directly from
traces on Chow motives (providing valuable statements on variation with the
prime p; versus
  2. Chebotarev using Lang-Weil to approximate the number of points on an
appropriate variety for the Galois stratification procedure.
  We consider variables taking values in the algebraic closure of Z/p but fixed
by respective powers of the Frobenius: we call these Frobenius vectors. For
this there is a twisted Chebotarev version stemming from a conjecture of
Deligne, and outlined in a preprint of Hrushovski. This paper expands on the
work of D. Wan, J. Denef and F. Loeser, J. Nicaise, I. Tomasic and E.

studying these planets' surface properties, and atmospheric compositions &
escape histories. Here we report the detection of the secondary eclipse of the
terrestrial exoplanet GJ1252b using the Spitzer Space Telescope's IRAC2 4.5
micron channel. We measure an eclipse depth of 149(+25/-32) ppm, corresponding
to a day-side brightness temperature of 1410(+91/-125) K and consistent with
the prediction for no atmosphere. Comparing our measurement to atmospheric
models indicates that GJ1252b has a surface pressure of <10 bar, substantially
less than Venus. Assuming energy-limited escape, even a 100 bar atmosphere
would be lost in <1 Myr, far shorter than estimated age of 3.9+/-0.4 Gyr. The
expected mass loss could be overcome by mantle outgassing, but only if the
mantle's carbon content were >7% by mass - over two orders of magnitude greater
than that found in Earth. We therefore conclude that GJ1252b has no significant
atmosphere. Model spectra with granitoid or feldspathic surface composition,
but with no atmosphere, are disfavored at >2 sigma. The eclipse occurs just
+1.4(+2.8/-1.0) min after orbital phase 0.5, indicating e cos
omega=+0.0025(+0.0049/-0.0018), consistent with a circular orbit. Tidal heating
is therefore likely to be negligible to GJ1252b's global energy budget.
Finally, we also analyze additional, unpublished TESS transit photometry of
GJ1252b which improves the precision of the transit ephemeris by a factor of
ten, provides a more precise planetary radius of 1.180+/-0.078 R_E, and rules

the 5D HDR light field from a single image, and a differentiable object
insertion formulation that enables end-to-end training with image-based losses
that encourage realism. Specifically, we design a hybrid lighting
representation tailored to outdoor scenes, which contains an HDR sky dome that
handles the extreme intensity of the sun, and a volumetric lighting
representation that models the spatially-varying appearance of the surrounding
scene. With the estimated lighting, our shadow-aware object insertion is fully
differentiable, which enables adversarial training over the composited image to
provide additional supervisory signal to the lighting prediction. We
experimentally demonstrate that our hybrid lighting representation is more
performant than existing outdoor lighting estimation methods. We further show
the benefits of our AR object insertion in an autonomous driving application,
where we obtain performance gains for a 3D object detector when trained on our

exhausted its central hydrogen content, leaving a helium core and a
hydrogen-burning shell. Oscillations of stars can be observed as periodic
dimmings and brightenings in the optical light curves. In red giant stars,
non-radial acoustic waves couple to gravity waves and give rise to mixed modes,
which behave as pressure (p) modes in the envelope and gravity (g) modes in the
core. These modes were previously used to measure the internal rotation of red
giants, leading to the conclusion that purely hydrodynamical processes of
angular momentum transport from the core are too inefficient. Magnetic fields
could produce the additional required transport. However, due to the lack of
direct measurements of magnetic fields in stellar interiors, very little is
currently known about their properties. Asteroseismology can provide direct
detection of magnetic fields because, like rotation, the fields induce shifts
in the oscillation mode frequencies. Here we report the measurement of magnetic
fields in the cores of three red giant stars observed with the Kepler
satellite. The fields induce shifts that break the symmetry of dipole mode
multiplets. We thus measure field strengths ranging from ~30 to ~100 kG in the
vicinity of the hydrogen-burning shell and place constraints on the field
tolopolgy.

of this, here we study binary neutron star mergers in shift-symmetric
Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity using evolutions of the full,
nonperturbative evolution equations. We find that the impact on the inspiral is
small, even at large values of the modified gravity coupling (as expected, as
neutron stars do not have scalar charge in this theory). However, postmerger
there can be strong scalar effects, including radiation. When a black hole
forms, it develops scalar charge, impacting the ringdown gravitational wave
signal. In cases where a longer-lived remnant star persists postmerger, we find
that the oscillations of the star source levels of scalar radiation similar to
the black hole formation cases. In remnant stars, we further find that at
coupling values comparable to the maximum value for which black hole solutions
of the same mass exist, there is significant nonlinear enhancement in the
scalar field, which if sufficiently large leads to a breakdown in the
evolution, seemingly due to loss of hyperbolicity of the underlying equations.

ways and give rise to important applications in science and technology. For
example, Floquet engineering exploits the possibility of band formation in the
frequency domain when a strong, periodic variation is imposed on parameters
such as spring constants. We describe here Kapitza engineering, where a drive
field oscillating at a frequency much higher than the characteristic
frequencies for the linear response of a system changes the potential energy
surface so much that maxima found at equilibrium become local minima, in
precise analogy to the celebrated Kapitza pendulum where the unstable inverted
configuration, with the mass above rather than below the fulcrum, actually
becomes stable. Our starting point is a quantum field theory of the
Ginzburg-Devonshire type, suitable for many condensed matter systems, including
particularly ferroelectrics and quantum paralectrics such as the common
substrate (for oxide electronics) strontium titanate (SrTiO${}_{3}$). We show
that an off-resonance oscillatory electric field generated by a laser-driven
THz source can induce ferroelectric order in the quantum-critical limit.
Heating effects are estimated to be manageable using pulsed radiation;
``hidden"" radiation-induced order can persist to low temperatures without
further pumping due to stabilization by strain. We suggest
second-harmonic-generation, soft-mode-spectroscopy, and X-ray-diffraction
experiments to characterize the induced order.

promising method to distinguish disc-shaping mechanisms is to study the gas
kinematics as characterising deviations from Keplerian rotation can be used to
probe underlying perturbations such as planets. Creating spiral structures, the
latter can also be traced in the brightness temperature. Here we analyse the
brightness temperatures and kinematics of a sample of 36 transition discs
observed with ALMA to search for substructures possibly tracing companions. We
use archival Band 6 and 7 observations of different CO isotopologues and fit
Keplerian disc models to the velocity fields. After subtraction of an
azimuthally averaged brightness temperature and Keplerian rotation model from
the data, we find significant substructures in both residuals of eight sources.
Other sources show tentative features, while half of our sample does not show
any substructures that may be indicative of planet-disc interactions. For the
first time, we compare the substructures from our analysis with various other
indicators of planets. About 20% of discs show strong features such as arcs or
spirals, possibly associated with the presence of planets, while the majority
do not present as clear planet-driven signatures. Almost all discs that exhibit
spirals in near-infrared scattered light show at least tentative features in
the CO data. The present data are able to reveal only very massive bodies and a
lack of features may suggest that, if there are planets, they are of lower mass

books, studies have focused on overall trends, such as the shapes of
narratives, which are independent of book length. We instead look at how words
change over the course of a book as a function of the number of words, rather
than the fraction of the book, completed at any given point; we define this
measure as ""cumulative word-time"". Using ousiometrics, a reinterpretation of
the valence-arousal-dominance framework of meaning obtained from semantic
differentials, we convert text into time series of power and danger scores in
cumulative word-time. Each time series is then decomposed using empirical mode
decomposition into a sum of constituent oscillatory modes and a non-oscillatory
trend. By comparing the decomposition of the original power and danger time
series with those derived from shuffled text, we find that shorter books
exhibit only a general trend, while longer books have fluctuations in addition
to the general trend. These fluctuations typically have a period of a few
thousand words regardless of the book length or library classification code,
but vary depending on the content and structure of the book. Our findings
suggest that, in the ousiometric sense, longer books are not expanded versions
of shorter books, but are more similar in structure to a concatenation of
shorter texts. Further, they are consistent with editorial practices that
require longer texts to be broken down into sections, such as chapters. Our
method also provides a data-driven denoising approach that works for texts of
various lengths, in contrast to the more traditional approach of using large
window sizes that may inadvertently smooth out relevant information, especially
for shorter texts. These results open up avenues for future work in
computational literary analysis, particularly the measurement of a basic unit
of narrative.

revision of the traditional abyssal circulation theory, which postulates that
ISOW should steadily flow along a deep boundary current (DBC) around the
subpolar North Atlantic prior to exiting it. The TPT analyses carried out here
allow to focus the attention on the portions of flow from the origin of ISOW to
the region where ISOW exits the subpolar North Atlantic and suggest that
insufficient sampling may be biasing the aforementioned demand. The analyses,
appropriately adapted to represent a continuous input of ISOW, are carried out
on three time-homogeneous Markov chains modeling the ISOW flow. One is
constructed using a high number of simulated trajectories homogeneously
covering the flow domain. The other two use much fewer trajectories which
heterogeneously cover the domain. The trajectories in the latter two chains are
observed trajectories or simulated trajectories subsampled at the observed
frequency. While the densely sampled chain supports a well-defined DBC, the
more heterogeneously sampled chains do not, irrespective of whether observed or
simulated trajectories are used. Studying the sampling sensitivity of the
Markov chains, we can give recommendations for enlarging the existing float
dataset to improve the significance of conclusions about time-asymptotic
aspects of the ISOW circulation.

probabilities and belong to known young moving groups (YMGs). We provide a
first attempt at constraining orbital parameters for 14 of the binaries in our

provide additional astrometric data and updated Gaia parallaxes. The
substantial orbital information built up here for four of the binaries allows
for direct comparison between individual dynamical masses and theoretical

properties. In modern Web systems, however, this often entails the verification
of the outputs generated when exercising the system with a very large set of
inputs. Full automation is thus required to lower costs and increase the
effectiveness of security testing. Unfortunately, to achieve such automation,
in addition to strategies for automatically deriving test inputs, we need to
address the oracle problem, which refers to the challenge, given an input for a
system, of distinguishing correct from incorrect behavior. In this paper, we
propose Metamorphic Security Testing for Web-interactions (MST-wi), a
metamorphic testing approach that integrates test input generation strategies
inspired by mutational fuzzing and alleviates the oracle problem in security
testing. It enables engineers to specify metamorphic relations (MRs) that
capture many security properties of Web systems. To facilitate the
specification of such MRs, we provide a domain-specific language accompanied by
an Eclipse editor. MST-wi automatically collects the input data and transforms
the MRs into executable Java code to automatically perform security testing. It
automatically tests Web systems to detect vulnerabilities based on the
relations and collected data. We provide a catalog of 76 system-agnostic MRs to
automate security testing in Web systems. It covers 39% of the OWASP security
testing activities not automated by state-of-the-art techniques; further, our
MRs can automatically discover 102 different types of vulnerabilities, which
correspond to 45% of the vulnerabilities due to violations of security design
principles according to the MITRE CWE database. We also define guidelines that
enable test engineers to improve the testability of the system under test with
respect to our approach.

merger products. J2211+1136 is a $1.27\, M_\odot$ WD with a rotation period of
$70.32$ s and a surface magnetic field of $15$ MG. J1901+1458 is a
$1.327$--$1.365\, M_\odot$ WD with a rotation period of $416.20$ s, and a
surface magnetic field in the range $600$--$900$ MG. With the assumption of
single-star evolution, the currently measured WD masses and surface
temperatures, the cooling ages of J2211+1136 and J1901+1458 are, respectively,
$2.61$--$2.85$ Gyr and $10$--$100$ Myr. We hypothesize that these WDs are DWD
merger products and compute the evolution of the post-merged configuration
formed by a central WD surrounded by a disk. We show that the post-merger
system evolves through three phases depending on whether accretion, mass
ejection (propeller), or magnetic braking dominates the torque onto the central
WD. We calculate the time the WD spends in each of these phases and obtain the
accretion rate and disk mass for which the WD rotational age, i.e., the total
time elapsed since the merger to the instant where the WD central remnant
reaches the current measured rotation period, agrees with the estimated WD
cooling age. We infer the mass values of the primary and secondary WD
components of the DWD merger that lead to a post-merger evolution consistent
with the observations.

signals of higher spatial resolution to be captured, resulting in potentially
more accurate source localization. In this paper, we show that in the noiseless

inaccuracies in boundary element method (BEM) head conductor models (or
equivalently, inaccurate volume current models) lead to increased signal and
equivalent current dipole (ECD) source localization inaccuracies when sensor
arrays are placed closer to the head. This is true especially in the case of
deep and superficial sources where volume current contributions are high. In
the noisy case however, the higher SNR for closer sensor arrays allows for an
improved ECD fit and outweighs the effects of head geometry inaccuracies. This
calls for an increase in emphasis in head modeling to reduce inverse modeling
errors, especially as the field of MEG strives for closer sensor arrays and
cleaner signals. An analytical form to obtain the magnetic field errors for
small perturbations in the BEM head geometry is also provided.

present a challenge: if sampled individuals with measured outcomes are
dissimilar from those with missing outcomes, unadjusted estimates of
arm-specific outcomes and the intervention effect may be biased. Further, CRTs
often enroll and randomize few clusters by necessity, limiting statistical
power and raising concerns about finite sample performance. Motivated by a
sub-study of the SEARCH community randomized trial on the incidence of TB
infection, we demonstrate interlocking methods to handle these challenges.
First, we extend Two-Stage targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) to
account for three sources of missingness: (1) sampling for the sub-study; (2)
measurement of baseline status among those sampled, and (3) measurement of
final status among those in the incidence cohort (i.e., persons known to be at

sub-units of the cluster can be considered the conditionally independent unit,
improving precision and statistical power but also causing the CRT to behave
more like an observational study. Our application to the SEARCH highlights the
impact of different assumptions on measurement and dependence as well as the
real-life gains of our approach for bias reduction and efficiency improvement.

machine learning methodologies and to pave the way for future deep-space
mission planning. In particular, the idea of using image-to-image translation
to virtually produce extreme ultra-violet channels has been proposed in several
recent studies, as a way to both enhance missions with less available channels
and to alleviate the challenges due to the low downlink rate in deep space.
This paper investigates the potential and the limitations of such a deep
learning approach by focusing on the permutation of four channels and an
encoder--decoder based architecture, with particular attention to how
morphological traits and brightness of the solar surface affect the neural
network predictions. In this work we want to answer the question: can synthetic
images of the solar corona produced via image-to-image translation be used for
scientific studies of the Sun? The analysis highlights that the neural network
produces high-quality images over three orders of magnitude in count rate
(pixel intensity) and can generally reproduce the covariance across channels
within a 1% error. However the model performance drastically diminishes in
correspondence of extremely high energetic events like flares, and we argue
that the reason is related to the rareness of such events posing a challenge to
model training.

management platform that enable the specification of diverse research processes
as reusable sets of actions, \emph{flows}, and the execution of such flows in
heterogeneous research environments. To support flows with broad spatial extent
(e.g., from scientific instrument to remote data center) and temporal extent
(from seconds to weeks), these Globus automation services feature: 1) cloud
hosting for reliable execution of even long-lived flows despite sporadic
failures; 2) a simple specification and extensible asynchronous action provider
API, for defining and executing a wide variety of actions and flows involving
heterogeneous resources; 3) an event-driven execution model for automating
execution of flows in response to arbitrary events; and 4) a rich security
model enabling authorization delegation mechanisms for secure execution of
long-running actions across distributed resources. These services permit
researchers to outsource and automate the management of a broad range of
research tasks to a reliable, scalable, and secure cloud platform. We present
use cases for Globus automation services, describe their design and
implementation, present microbenchmark studies, and review experiences applying
the services in a range of applications.

the optical properties, except for the infrared region where only silicon and
germanium show some absorption, the other structures exhibit optical activity
only in the visible and ultra-violet regions, and all of them have large

ineffective against a single jammer following several different jamming
policies or multiple jammers with distinct policies. Therefore, this paper
proposes an anti-jamming method that can adapt its policy to the current
jamming attack. Moreover, for the multiple jammers scenario, an anti-jamming
method that estimates the future occupied channels using the jammers' occupied
channels in previous time slots is proposed. In both single and multiple
jammers scenarios, the interaction between the users and jammers is modeled
using recurrent neural networks (RNN)s. The performance of the proposed
anti-jamming methods is evaluated by calculating the users' successful
transmission rate (STR) and ergodic rate (ER), and compared to a baseline based
on Q-learning (DQL). Simulation results show that for the single jammer
scenario, all the considered jamming policies are perfectly detected and high
STR and ER are maintained. Moreover, when 70 % of the spectrum is under jamming
attacks from multiple jammers, the proposed method achieves an STR and ER
greater than 75 % and 80 %, respectively. These values rise to 90 % when 30 %

yet require interactive response times. Serverless functions are seen as a way
to address this use case since they offer an appealing alternative to
maintaining (and paying for) a fixed infrastructure. Recent research has
analyzed the potential of serverless for data processing. In this paper, we
expand on such work by looking into the question of serverless resource
allocation to data processing tasks (number and size of the functions). We
formulate a general model to roughly estimate completion time and financial
cost, which we apply to augment an existing serverless data processing system
with an advisory tool that automatically identifies configurations striking a
good balance -- which we define as being close to the ""knee"" of their Pareto
frontier. The model takes into account key aspects of serverless: start-up,
computation, network transfers, and overhead as a function of the input sizes
and intermediate result exchanges. Using (micro)benchmarks and parts of TPC-H,
we show that this advisor is capable of pinpointing configurations desirable to
the user. Moreover, we identify and discuss several aspects of data processing
on serverless affecting efficiency. By using an automated tool to configure the
resources, the barrier to using serverless for data processing is lowered and
the narrow window where it is cost effective can be expanded by using a more
optimal allocation instead of having to over-provision the design.

introduced by Borodin et al. We introduce a refinement of the AQT $(\rho,
\sigma)$-bounded adversary, which we call a \emph{locally bursty adversary}
(LBA) that parameterizes injection patterns jointly by edge utilization and
packet origin. For constant ($O(1)$) parameters, the LBA model is strictly more
permissive than the $(\rho, \sigma)$ model. For example, there are injection
patterns in the LBA model with constant parameters that can only be realized as
$(\rho, \sigma)$-bounded injection patterns with $\rho + \sigma = \Omega(n)$
(where $n$ is the network size). We show that the LBA model (unlike the $(\rho,
\sigma)$ model) is closed under packet bundling and discretization operations.
Thus, the LBA model allows one to reduce the study of general (uniform)
capacity networks and inhomogenous packet sizes to unit capacity networks with
homogeneous packets.
  On the algorithmic side, we focus on information gathering networks -- i.e.,
networks in which all packets share a common destination, and the union of
packet routes forms a tree. We show that the Odd-Even Downhill (OED) forwarding
protocol described independently by Dobrev et al.\ and Patt-Shamir and
Rosenbaum achieves buffer space usage of $O(\log n)$ against all LBAs with
constant parameters. OED is a local protocol, but we show that the upper bound
is tight even when compared to centralized protocols. Our lower bound for the
LBA model is in contrast to the $(\rho, \sigma)$-model, where centralized
protocols can achieve worst-case buffer space usage $O(1)$ for $\rho, \sigma =
O(1)$, while the $O(\log n)$ upper bound for OED is optimal only for local

where a held-out set is used for iterative evaluation during training to find a
sweet spot in the number of training steps that gives maximum generalization.
However, such a method requires a disjoint validation set, thus part of the
labeled data from the training set is usually left out for this purpose, which
is not ideal when training data is scarce. Furthermore, when the training
labels are noisy, the performance of the model over a validation set may not be
an accurate proxy for generalization. In this paper, we propose a method to
spot an early stopping point in the training iterations without the need for a
validation set. We first show that in the overparameterized regime the randomly
initialized weights of a linear model converge to the same direction during
training. Using this result, we propose to train two parallel instances of a
linear model, initialized with different random seeds, and use their
intersection as a signal to detect overfitting. In order to detect
intersection, we use the cosine distance between the weights of the parallel
models during training iterations. Noticing that the final layer of a NN is a
linear map of pre-last layer activations to output logits, we build on our
criterion for linear models and propose an extension to multi-layer networks,
using the new notion of counterfactual weights. We conduct experiments on two
areas that early stopping has noticeable impact on preventing overfitting of a
NN: (i) learning from noisy labels; and (ii) learning to rank in IR. Our
experiments on four widely used datasets confirm the effectiveness of our
method for generalization. For a wide range of learning rates, our method,

several drivers cannot coordinate their charging station visit decisions. Here,
navigation service platforms can optimally balance charging demand over
available stations to reduce possible station visit conflicts and increase user
satisfaction. While such fleet-optimized charging station visit recommendations
may alleviate local bottlenecks, they can also harm the system if
self-interested navigation service platforms seek to maximize their own

charging station allocation as a resource allocation game in which navigation
platforms constitute players and assign potentially free charging stations to

you must address the genus 0 and 1 components of its projective normalization
$\tilde C_{f,g}$. For $f$ and $g$ polynomials with $f$ indecomposable, [Fr73a]
distinguished $\tilde C_{f,g}$ with $u=1$ versus $u > 1$ components (Schinzel's
problem). For $u = 1$, [Prop. 1, Fr73b] gave a direct genus formula. To
complete $u > 1$ required an adhoc genus computation.
  [Pak22] dropped the indecomposable and polynomial restrictions but added
$\tilde C_{f,g}$ is irreducible ($u = 1$). He showed - for fixed $f$ - unless
the Galois closure of the cover for $f$ has genus 0 or 1, the genus grows
linearly in deg($g$). Method I and Method II extend [Prop. 1, Fr73b}] using
Nielsen classes to generalize Pakovich's formulation for $u > 1$.
  Method I plays on the covers $f$ and $g$ to the $z$-line, $P^1_z$, from which
we compute the fiber product.
  Method II uses the projection to the $y$-line, $P^1_y$, based on explicitly
computing branch cycles for this cover.
  Hurwitz families track the significance of these components. Expanding on
[Prop. 2, Fr73a] shows how to approach Pakovich's problem. With no loss, start
with ($f^*,g^*$) which have the same Galois closures, and for which their
canonical representations are entangled. They, therefore, produce more than one
component on the fiber product.
  Then, we classify the possible component types, $W$, that appear on $\tilde
C_{f^*,g^*}$ using the branch cycles for $W$ that come from Method II. The
result is a Nielsen class formulation telling explicitly what $g_1\,$s to avoid
to assure the growth of the component genuses of $\tilde C_{f*,g*og_1}$ as
deg($g_1$) increases. Of particular note: using and expanding on Nielsen
classes and the solution of the genus 0 problem (classifying the monodromy
groups of indecomposable rational functions).

a critical role in many research areas in mathematics and physics. However,
even though several discretizations of Ricci curvatures for discrete
combinatorial objects such as networks have been proposed and studied by
mathematicians, the computational complexity aspects of these discretizations
have escaped the attention of theoretical computer scientists to a large
extent. In this paper, we study one such discretization, namely the
Ollivier-Ricci curvature, from the perspective of efficient computation by
fine-grained reductions and local query-based algorithms. Our main
contributions are the following.
  (a) We relate our curvature computation problem to minimum weight perfect
matching problem on complete bipartite graphs via fine-grained reduction.
  (b) We formalize the computational aspects of the curvature computation
problems in suitable frameworks so that they can be studied by researchers in
local algorithms.
  (c) We provide the first known lower and upper bounds on queries for
query-based algorithms for the curvature computation problems in our local
algorithms framework. En route, we also illustrate a localized version of our
fine-grained reduction.

fields of up to 70 kOe using magnetometry and muon spin relaxation. Two
transitions are identified: a spin-glass-like transition that appears between
55 K and 190 K depending on composition, and a ferrimagnetic transition that
occurs at approximately 43 K in multiple samples with widely varying
compositions. The magnetic signatures at 43 K are remarkably insensitive to
chemical composition. A modified Curie-Weiss model was used to fit the
susceptibility data and to extract the net effective magnetic moment for each
sample. The resulting values for the net effective moment were either
diminished with increasing Cr or Mn concentrations or enhanced with decreasing
Fe, Co, or Ni concentrations. Beyond a sufficiently large effective moment, the
magnetic ground state transitions from ferrimagnetism to ferromagnetism. The
effective magnetic moments, together with the corresponding compositions, are
used in a global linear regression analysis to extract element-specific
effective magnetic moments, which are compared to the values obtained by
ab-initio based density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These moments
provide the information necessary to controllably tune the magnetic properties
of Cantor alloy variants.

{\AA} and 4000 {\AA}, with resolutions ranging from 6000 to 240. The efficient
instrument provides throughputs > 4% (far-UV; FUV) and > 15% (near-UV; NUV),
comparable to HST/COS and much better than HST/STIS, over the same spectral
range. A key design feature is the LiF prism, which serves as a dispersive
element and provides high throughput even after accounting for radiation
degradation. The use of two delta-doped Electron-Multiplying CCD detectors with
UV-optimized, single-layer anti-reflection coatings provides high quantum
efficiency and low detector noise. From the Earth-Sun second Lagrangian point,
UV-SCOPE will continuously observe planetary transits and stellar variability
in the full FUV-to-NUV range, with negligible astrophysical background.
  All these features make UV-SCOPE the ideal instrument to study exoplanetary
atmospheres and the impact of host stars on their planets. UV-SCOPE was
proposed to NASA as a Medium Explorer (MidEx) mission for the 2021 Announcement
of Opportunity. If approved, the observatory will be developed over a 5-year
period. Its primary science mission takes 34 months to complete. The spacecraft
carries enough fuel for 6 years of operations.

environments, such as gradients in light, heat or nutrient concentration, that
can lead to directed motion (or taxis). Recent research has explored
inhomogeneity in the rheological properties of a suspending fluid, in
particular viscosity, as a mechanical (rather than biological) mechanism for
taxis. Theoretical and experimental studies have shown that gradients in
viscosity can lead to reorientation due to asymmetric viscous forces. In
particular, recent experiments with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii algae swimming
across sharp viscosity gradients have observed that the microorganisms are
redirected and scattered due to the viscosity change. Here we develop a simple
theoretical model to explain these experiments. We model the swimmers as
spherical squirmers and focus on small, but sharp, viscosity changes. We derive
a law, analogous to Snell's law of refraction, that governs the orientation of
active particles in the presence of a viscosity interface. Theoretical
predictions show good agreement with experiments and provide a mechanistic
understanding of the observed reorientation process.

experimentally detect this novel state by impedance and voltage measurements.
In the DSM phase, the Dirac cone exhibits an itinerant feature with a tunable

explicit or implicit feedback very quickly to the short videos they watch. The
recommender system needs to perceive users' preferences in real-time in order
to satisfy their changing interests. Traditionally, recommender systems
deployed at server side return a ranked list of videos for each request from

detection systems, classifying misinformation in an unseen domain remains an
elusive challenge. To address this issue, a common approach is to introduce a
domain critic and encourage domain-invariant input features. However, early
misinformation often demonstrates both conditional and label shifts against
existing misinformation data (e.g., class imbalance in COVID-19 datasets),
rendering such methods less effective for detecting early misinformation. In
this paper, we propose contrastive adaptation network for early misinformation
detection (CANMD). Specifically, we leverage pseudo labeling to generate
high-confidence target examples for joint training with source data. We
additionally design a label correction component to estimate and correct the
label shifts (i.e., class priors) between the source and target domains.
Moreover, a contrastive adaptation loss is integrated in the objective function
to reduce the intra-class discrepancy and enlarge the inter-class discrepancy.
As such, the adapted model learns corrected class priors and an invariant
conditional distribution across both domains for improved estimation of the
target data distribution. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
CANMD, we study the case of COVID-19 early misinformation detection and perform
extensive experiments using multiple real-world datasets. The results suggest
that CANMD can effectively adapt misinformation detection systems to the unseen
COVID-19 target domain with significant improvements compared to the
state-of-the-art baselines.

properties from multiple thermochemistry tables (e.g., Chase et al., 1998).
VapoRock calculates the partial pressures of 34 gaseous species in equilibrium
with magmatic liquid in the system Si-Mg-Fe-Al-Ca-Na-K-Ti-Cr-O at desired
temperatures and oxygen fugacities (fO2, or partial pressure of O2). Comparison
with experiments shows that pressures and melt-oxide activities (which vary
over many orders of magnitude) are reproduced to within a factor of ~3,
consistent with measurement uncertainties. We also benchmark the model against
a wide selection of igneous rock compositions including bulk silicate Earth,
predicting elemental vapor abundances that are comparable (Na, Ca, & Al) or
more realistic (K, Si, Mg, Fe, & Ti) than those of the closed-source MAGMA code
(with maximum deviations by factors of 10-300 for K & Si). Vapor abundances
depend critically on the activities of liquid components. The MELTS model
underpinning VapoRock was calibrated and extensively tested on natural igneous
liquids. In contrast, MAGMA's liquid model assumes ideal mixtures of a limited
set of chemically simplified pseudo-species, which only roughly approximates
the non-ideal compositional interactions typical of many-component natural

chirality flipping up-scattering processes occurring through either neutrino
magnetic dipole moment or the weakly coupled scalar interactions can also
produce heavy Kaluza-Klein modes of the corresponding right-handed neutral
leptons propagating in one or more extra dimensions. However, to conserve the
four-dimensional energy-momentum, their masses must be below the maximum energy
of the neutrinos in the initial state. The appreciable size of extra dimensions
connected with these heavy neutral leptons can thus affect the cross-sections
of these processes. This framework applies to any up-scattering process. Our

neutrino-nucleus scattering process. We derive constraints on the size of extra

mobile app recommendations. In many such recommendation scenarios, contexts are
drifting over time. For example, in a mobile game recommendation, contextual
features like locations, battery, and storage levels of mobile devices are
frequently drifting over time. However, most existing graph-based collaborative
filtering methods are designed under the assumption of static features.
Therefore, they would require frequent retraining and/or yield graphical models
burgeoning in sizes, impeding their suitability for context-drifting
recommendations.
  In this work, we propose a specifically tailor-made Hybrid Static and
Adaptive Graph Embedding (HySAGE) network for context-drifting recommendations.
Our key idea is to disentangle the relatively static user-item interaction and
rapidly drifting contextual features. Specifically, our proposed HySAGE network
learns a relatively static graph embedding from user-item interaction and an
adaptive embedding from drifting contextual features. These embeddings are
incorporated into an interest network to generate the user interest in some
certain context. We adopt an interactive attention module to learn the
interactions among static graph embeddings, adaptive contextual embeddings, and
user interest, helping to achieve a better final representation. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HySAGE significantly
improves the performance of the existing state-of-the-art recommendation

estimation of causal effects from non-experimental data is crucial for
understanding the mechanism underlying the data and for decision-making on
effective responses or interventions. A great deal of research has been
conducted on this challenging problem from different angles. For causal effect
estimation in data, assumptions such as Markov property, faithfulness and
causal sufficiency are always made. Under the assumptions, full knowledge such
as, a set of covariates or an underlying causal graph, is still required. A
practical challenge is that in many applications, no such full knowledge or
only some partial knowledge is available. In recent years, research has emerged
to use a search strategy based on graphical causal modelling to discover useful
knowledge from data for causal effect estimation, with some mild assumptions,
and has shown promose in tackling the practical challenge. In this survey, we
review the methods and focus on the challenges the data-driven methods face. We
discuss the assumptions, strengths and limitations of the data-driven methods.
We hope this review will motivate more researchers to design better data-driven
methods based on graphical causal modelling for the challenging problem of

structure that maximizes mechanical performance, is vital in engineering design
applications in aerospace, mechanical, and civil engineering. Generative
adversarial networks (GANs) have recently emerged as a popular alternative to
traditional iterative topology optimization methods. However, these models are
often difficult to train, have limited generalizability, and due to their goal
of mimicking optimal structures, neglect manufacturability and performance
objectives like mechanical compliance. We propose TopoDiff - a conditional
diffusion-model-based architecture to perform performance-aware and
manufacturability-aware topology optimization that overcomes these issues. Our
model introduces a surrogate model-based guidance strategy that actively favors
structures with low compliance and good manufacturability. Our method
significantly outperforms a state-of-art conditional GAN by reducing the
average error on physical performance by a factor of eight and by producing
eleven times fewer infeasible samples. By introducing diffusion models to
topology optimization, we show that conditional diffusion models have the
ability to outperform GANs in engineering design synthesis applications too.
Our work also suggests a general framework for engineering optimization
problems using diffusion models and external performance with constraint-aware

feature extractor designed specifically for extracting disruption precursor

precursors of disruption, providing a promising foundation for transferable

extraction on J-TEXT. Based on the feature extractor trained on J-TEXT, the
disruption prediction model was transferred to EAST data with mere 20

consistent image from a specific text description. The images synthesized by
off-the-shelf models usually contain limited components compared with the
corresponding image and text description, which decreases the image quality and
the textual-visual consistency. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Vision-Language Matching strategy for text-to-image synthesis, named VLMGAN*,
which introduces a dual vision-language matching mechanism to strengthen the
image quality and semantic consistency. The dual vision-language matching
mechanism considers textual-visual matching between the generated image and the
corresponding text description, and visual-visual consistent constraints
between the synthesized image and the real image. Given a specific text
description, VLMGAN* firstly encodes it into textual features and then feeds
them to a dual vision-language matching-based generative model to synthesize a
photo-realistic and textual semantic consistent image. Besides, the popular
evaluation metrics for text-to-image synthesis are borrowed from simple image
generation, which mainly evaluates the reality and diversity of the synthesized
images. Therefore, we introduce a metric named Vision-Language Matching Score
(VLMS) to evaluate the performance of text-to-image synthesis which can
consider both the image quality and the semantic consistency between
synthesized image and the description. The proposed dual multi-level
vision-language matching strategy can be applied to other text-to-image
synthesis methods. We implement this strategy on two popular baselines, which
are marked with ${\text{VLMGAN}_{+\text{AttnGAN}}}$ and
${\text{VLMGAN}_{+\text{DFGAN}}}$. The experimental results on two widely-used

doubts (as a snap taken with smart phones) and get them resolved in minutes.
However, the significant increase in the number of student-posted doubts with
high variance in quality on these platforms not only presents challenges for
teachers' navigation to address them but also increases the resolution time per
doubt. Both are not acceptable, as high doubt resolution time hinders the
students learning progress. This necessitates ways to automatically identify if
there exists a similar doubt in repository and then serve it to the teacher as
the plausible solution to validate and communicate with the student. Supervised
learning techniques (like Siamese architecture) require labels to identify the
matches, which is not feasible as labels are scarce and expensive. In this
work, we, thus, developed a label-agnostic doubt matching paradigm based on the

custom BYOL which combines domain-specific augmentation with contrastive

highlighted that, custom BYOL improves the top-1 matching accuracy by

outperform convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks.
Several attempts have been made to understand robustness of Transformers
against adversarial attacks, but existing studies draw inconsistent results,
i.e., some conclude that Transformers are more robust than CNNs, while some
others find that they have similar degrees of robustness. In this paper, we
address two issues unexplored in the existing studies examining adversarial
robustness of Transformers. First, we argue that the image quality should be
simultaneously considered in evaluating adversarial robustness. We find that
the superiority of one architecture to another in terms of robustness can
change depending on the attack strength expressed by the quality of the
attacked images. Second, by noting that Transformers and CNNs rely on different
types of information in images, we formulate an attack framework, called
Fourier attack, as a tool for implementing flexible attacks, where an image can
be attacked in the spectral domain as well as in the spatial domain. This
attack perturbs the magnitude and phase information of particular frequency
components selectively. Through extensive experiments, we find that
Transformers tend to rely more on phase information and low frequency
information than CNNs, and thus sometimes they are even more vulnerable under
frequency-selective attacks. It is our hope that this work provides new
perspectives in understanding the properties and adversarial robustness of
Transformers.

focusing on the multiqubit scenario. For genuine multipartite (excluding
bipartite) unitary gates of Schmidt rank two, there is an essential fact that
their Schmidt decompositions are unique. Based on this fact, we propose a key
notion named as singular number to classify the unitary gates concerned. The
singular number is defined as the number of local singular operators in the
Schmidt decomposition. We then determine the accurate range of singular number.
For each singular number, we formulate the parametric Schmidt decompositions of
genuine multiqubit unitary gates under local equivalence. Finally, we extend
the study to three-qubit diagonal unitary gates due to the close relation
between diagonal unitary gates and Schmidt-rank-two unitaries. We start with
discussing two typical examples of Schmidt rank two, one of which is a
fundamental three-qubit unitary gate, i.e., the CCZ gate. Then we characterize
the diagonal unitary gates of Schmidt rank greater than two. We show that a

their alloy Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3-x}$Se$_{x}$ have been established from

also observed based on these popular topological insulators by the application
of pressure chemical dopant and heterostructures. However, the experiments
mainly focusing on Bi$_{2}$Se$_3$ doped by metals have not provided the
consistent evidence to support the topological superconductivity. Here we carry
out a systematic high-pressure study on a topological insulator
Bi$_{2}$Te$_{2.7}$Se$_{0.3}$ to provide the convincing evidence for the
expected topological superconductivity. Four phases with different structures
are found upon compression. The topological surface state is identified in the
entire initial phase, while superconductivity is found to coexist with such a
state of the compressed material after its passing the electronic topological
transition, followed by three other superconducting phases without topological
character. For these superconducting phases, we observe that the upper critical
field follows with the temperature in the critical exponent ${2/3}$ for the
first one with the topological surface state and $1$ for the left. These
observations support the realization of the topological superconductivity in
the initial phase according to the theoretically proposed critical field
measure. This work also points out a big pool and new direction for finding
topological superconductors from topological thermoelectric materials.

navigate to a target indicated by an image in a previously unseen scene.
Current methods introduce diverse memory mechanisms which save navigation
history to solve this task. However, these methods use all observations in the
memory for generating navigation actions without considering which fraction of
this memory is informative. To address this limitation, we present the MemoNav,
a novel memory mechanism for image-goal navigation, which retains the agent's
informative short-term memory and long-term memory to improve the navigation
performance on a multi-goal task. The node features on the agent's topological
map are stored in the short-term memory, as these features are dynamically
updated. To aid the short-term memory, we also generate long-term memory by
continuously aggregating the short-term memory via a graph attention module.
The MemoNav retains the informative fraction of the short-term memory via a
forgetting module based on a Transformer decoder and then incorporates this
retained short-term memory and the long-term memory into working memory.
Lastly, the agent uses the working memory for action generation. We evaluate
our model on a new multi-goal navigation dataset. The experimental results show
that the MemoNav outperforms the SoTA methods by a large margin with a smaller
fraction of navigation history. The results also empirically show that our
model is less likely to be trapped in a deadlock, which further validates that
the MemoNav improves the agent's navigation efficiency by reducing redundant
steps.

low-cost and almost passive metamaterials with tunable reflection properties,
have been recently proposed as an enabling technology for programmable wireless
propagation environments. In this paper, we present asymptotic closed-form
expressions for the mean and variance of the mutual information metric for a
multi-antenna transmitter-receiver pair in the presence of multiple RISs, using
methods from statistical physics. While nominally valid in the large system
limit, we show that the derived Gaussian approximation for the mutual
information can be quite accurate, even for modest-sized antenna arrays and
metasurfaces. The above results are particularly useful when fast-fading
conditions are present, which renders instantaneous channel estimation
extremely challenging. We find that, when the channel close to an RIS is
correlated, for instance due to small angle spread, which is reasonable for
wireless systems with increasing carrier frequencies, the communication link
benefits significantly from statistical RIS phase optimization, resulting in
gains that are surprisingly higher than the nearly uncorrelated case. Using our
novel asymptotic properties of the correlation matrices of the impinging and
outgoing signals at the RISs, we can optimize the metasurfaces without
brute-force numerical optimization. Furthermore, when the desired reflection
from any of the RISs departs significantly from geometrical optics, the
metasurfaces can be optimized to provide robust communication links, without
significant need for their optimal placement.

aspect, opinion, and their sentiment relations as sentiment triplets. Existing
works usually formulate the span detection as a 1D token tagging problem, and
model the sentiment recognition with a 2D tagging matrix of token pairs.
Moreover, by leveraging the token representation of Pretrained Language
Encoders (PLEs) like BERT, they can achieve better performance. However, they
simply leverage PLEs as feature extractors to build their modules but never
have a deep look at what specific knowledge does PLEs contain. In this paper,
we argue that instead of further designing modules to capture the inductive
bias of ASTE, PLEs themselves contain ""enough"" features for 1D and 2D tagging:
(1) The token representation contains the contextualized meaning of token
itself, so this level feature carries necessary information for 1D tagging. (2)
The attention matrix of different PLE layers can further capture multi-level
linguistic knowledge existing in token pairs, which benefits 2D tagging. (3)
Furthermore, with simple transformations, these two features can also be easily
converted to the 2D tagging matrix and 1D tagging sequence, respectively. That
will further boost the tagging results. By doing so, PLEs can be natural
tagging frameworks and achieve a new state of the art, which is verified by
extensive experiments and deep analyses.

Learning from imbalanced data poses a major challenge, which has instigated a
lot of research in this area. Data preprocessing using sampling techniques is a
standard approach to deal with the imbalance present in the data. Since
standard classification algorithms do not perform well on imbalanced data, the
dataset needs to be adequately balanced before training. This can be
accomplished by oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority
class. In this study, a novel hybrid sampling algorithm has been proposed. To
overcome the limitations of the sampling techniques while ensuring the quality
of the retained sampled dataset, a sophisticated framework has been developed
to properly combine three different sampling techniques. Neighborhood Cleaning
rule is first applied to reduce the imbalance. Random undersampling is then
strategically coupled with the SMOTE algorithm to obtain an optimal balance in
the dataset. This proposed hybrid methodology, termed ""SMOTE-RUS-NC"", has been
compared with other state-of-the-art sampling techniques. The strategy is
further incorporated into the ensemble learning framework to obtain a more
robust classification algorithm, termed ""SRN-BRF"". Rigorous experimentation has
been conducted on 26 imbalanced datasets with varying degrees of imbalance. In
virtually all datasets, the proposed two algorithms outperformed existing
sampling strategies, in many cases by a substantial margin. Especially in
highly imbalanced datasets where popular sampling techniques failed utterly,
they achieved unparalleled performance. The superior results obtained
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed models and their potential to be
powerful sampling algorithms in imbalanced domain.

  Surfaces","To appear in IEEE TCOM",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communications recently
appeared as a game-changing technology for next-generation wireless
communications due to its unprecedented ability to reform the propagation
environment. One of the main aspects of using RISs is the exploitation of the
so-called passive beamforming (PB), which is carried out by adjusting the
reflection coefficients (mainly the phase shifts) of the individual RIS
elements. However, practically, this individual phase shift adjustment is
associated with many issues in hardware implementation, limiting the RIS
achievable gain. In this paper, we propose a low-cost, phase shift-free and
novel PB scheme by only optimizing the on/off states of the RIS elements while
fixing their phase shifts. The proposed PB scheme is shown to achieve the same
scaling law (quadratic growth with the RIS size) for the signal-to-noise ratio
as in the classical phase shift-based PB scheme, yet, with far less sensitivity
to spatial correlation and phase errors. We provide a unified mathematical
analysis that characterizes the performance of the proposed PB scheme and
obtain the outage probability for the considered RIS-assisted system. Based on
the provided computer simulations, the proposed PB scheme is shown to have a
clear superiority over the classical one under different performance metrics.

health and performance of occupants. Consequently, machine learning (ML) is
increasingly used to solve challenges related to indoor thermal comfort.
Temporal variability of thermal comfort perception is an important problem that
regulates occupant well-being and energy consumption. However, in most ML-based
thermal comfort studies, temporal aspects such as the time of day, circadian
rhythm, and outdoor temperature are not considered. This work addresses these
problems. It investigates the impact of circadian rhythm and outdoor
temperature on the prediction accuracy and classification performance of ML
models. The data is gathered through month-long field experiments carried out
in 14 classrooms of 5 schools, involving 512 primary school students. Four
thermal comfort metrics are considered as the outputs of Deep Neural Networks
and Support Vector Machine models for the dataset. The effect of temporal
variability on school children's comfort is shown through a ""time of day""
analysis. Temporal variability in prediction accuracy is demonstrated (up to
80%). Furthermore, we show that outdoor temperature (varying over time)
positively impacts the prediction performance of thermal comfort models by up
to 30%. The importance of spatio-temporal context is demonstrated by
contrasting micro-level (location specific) and macro-level (6 locations across
a city) performance. The most important finding of this work is that a
definitive improvement in prediction accuracy is shown with an increase in the
time of day and sky illuminance, for multiple thermal comfort metrics.

new variants have been designed to obtain convergence. However, vanilla Adam
remains exceptionally popular and it works well in practice. Why is there a gap
between theory and practice? We point out there is a mismatch between the
settings of theory and practice: Reddi et al. 2018 pick the problem after
picking the hyperparameters of Adam, i.e., $(\beta_1, \beta_2)$; while
practical applications often fix the problem first and then tune $(\beta_1,
\beta_2)$. Due to this observation, we conjecture that the empirical
convergence can be theoretically justified, only if we change the order of
picking the problem and hyperparameter. In this work, we confirm this
conjecture. We prove that, when $\beta_2$ is large and $\beta_1 <
\sqrt{\beta_2}<1$, Adam converges to the neighborhood of critical points. The
size of the neighborhood is propositional to the variance of stochastic
gradients. Under an extra condition (strong growth condition), Adam converges
to critical points. It is worth mentioning that our results cover a wide range
of hyperparameters: as $\beta_2$ increases, our convergence result can cover
any $\beta_1 \in [0,1)$ including $\beta_1=0.9$, which is the default setting
in deep learning libraries. To our knowledge, this is the first result showing
that Adam can converge without any modification on its update rules. Further,
our analysis does not require assumptions of bounded gradients or bounded
2nd-order momentum. When $\beta_2$ is small, we further point out a large
region of $(\beta_1,\beta_2)$ where Adam can diverge to infinity. Our
divergence result considers the same setting as our convergence result,
indicating a phase transition from divergence to convergence when increasing
$\beta_2$. These positive and negative results can provide suggestions on how
to tune Adam hyperparameters.

$\mu$ with a saddle-node bifurcation at $\mu =0$ can be modelled by an extended
normal form $\dot y = \nu (\mu )-y^2+a(\mu )y^3$, where the functions $\nu$ and
$a$ are solutions to equations that can be written down explicitly. The
equivalence to the original equations is a local differentiable conjugacy on
the basins of attraction and repulsion of stationary points in the parameter
region for which these exist, and is a differentiable conjugacy on the whole
local interval otherwise. (Recall that in standard approaches local equivalence
is topological rather than differentiable.) The value $a(0)$ is Takens'
coefficient from normal form theory.
  The results explain the sense in which normal forms extend away from the
bifurcation point and provide a new and more detailed characterisation of the
saddle-node bifurcation. The one-dimensional system can be derived from higher
dimensional equations using centre manifold theory. We illustrate this using
two examples from climate science and show how the functions $\nu$ and $a$ can
be determined analytically in some settings and numerically in others.

two-dimensional (2D) materials have received significant interest as potential
electromechanical materials. Flexoelectricity is an electromechanical coupling
between strain gradient and polarization. Unlike piezoelectricity, which exists
only in non-centrosymmetric materials, flexoelectricity theoretically exists in
all dielectric materials. However, most work on the electromechanical energy
conversion potential of 2D materials has focused on their piezoelectric, and
not flexoelectric behavior and properties. In the present work, we demonstrate
that the intrinsic structural asymmetry present in monolayer Janus transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) enables significant flexoelectric properties. We
report these flexoelectric properties using a recently developed charge-dipole
model that couples with classical molecular dynamics simulations. By employing
a prescribed bending deformation, we directly calculate the flexoelectric
constants while eliminating the piezoelectric contribution to the polarization.
We find that the flexoelectric response of a Janus TMDC is positively
correlated to its initial degree of asymmetry, which contributes to stronger
$\sigma-\sigma$ interactions as the initial degree of asymmetry rises. In
addition, the high transfer of charge across atoms in Janus TMDCs leads to
larger electric fields due to $\pi-\sigma$ coupling. These enhanced
$\sigma-\sigma$ and $\pi-\sigma$ interactions are found to cause the
flexoelectric coefficients of the Janus TMDCs to be several times higher than
traditional TMDCs such as MoS$_{2}$, whose flexoelectric constant is already
ten times larger than graphene.

nonlinearity. At most four stable steady states can be achieved in our scheme
in the presence of the CK effect, different from the bistable behavior of the
standard optomechanical system. Under the constant input laser power, the
effective detuning and mechanical resonant frequency can be modulated by the CK
nonlinearity, which results in an optimal CK coupling strength for cooling.
Similarly, there will be an optimal input laser power for cooling when the CK
coupling strength stays fixed. Our scheme can be extended to break the dark
mode effect of multiple degenerate mechanical modes by introducing more than
one CK effects. To fulfill the requirement of the simultaneous ground-state
cooling of N multiple degenerate mechanical modes N-1 CK effects with different

failures, its large computational cost makes it prohibitive to study the CO
adsorption for any but the simplest ordered cases. Here, we address these
challenges by developing a machine-learned force field (MLFF) with near RPA
accuracy for the prediction of coverage-dependent adsorption of CO on the
Rh(111) surface through an efficient on-the-fly active learning procedure and a
$\Delta$-machine learning approach. We show that the RPA-derived MLFF is
capable to accurately predict the Rh(111) surface energy, CO adsorption site
preference as well as adsorption energies at different coverages that are all
in good agreement with experiments. Moreover, the coverage-dependent
ground-state adsorption patterns and adsorption saturation coverage are
identified.

studies the theoretical model of innovative thinking based on of category

GNRS is a periodic undulating graphene nanoribbon, where undulations are of
sinus or half-circles or horseshoe shapes. Besides those, GNRS geometry depends
on design parameters, like pitch's length and amplitude, thickness and joining
angle. Because of the fact that parametric influence on the resulting physical
properties are expensive and complicated to be examined experimentally, we
explore the mechanical, thermal and electromechanical properties of GNRS using
molecular dynamics simulations. Our results demonstrate that horseshoe shape
design of GNRS (GNRH) can distinctly outperform the graphene kirigami design
concerning the stretchability. The thermal conductivity of GNRS were also
examined by developing a multiscale modeling, which suggests that the thermal
transport along these nanostructures can be effectively tuned. We found that
however, the tensile stretching of GNRS and GNRH does not yield any
piezoelectric polarization. The bending induced hybridization change results in
a flexoelectric polarization, where the corresponding flexoelectric coefficient
is $25\%$ higher than graphene. Our results provide a comprehensive vision to
the critical physical properties of GNRS and may help to employ the outstanding

modern protein structure prediction methods. As the state of the art,
AlphaFold2 has dramatically raised the accuracy without performing explicit

underperformance of AlphaFold2 for poor MSA targets. EvoGen allows us to
manipulate the folding landscape either by denoising the searched MSA or by
generating virtual MSA, and helps AlphaFold2 fold accurately in low-data regime

able to make accurate predictions with few-shot MSA not only generalizes
AlphaFold2 better for orphan sequences, but also democratizes its use for

surpassing human intelligence in several cases. As of late, they have also
established themselves in the biomedical and healthcare domains, where they
have shown a lot of promise, but have not yet achieved widespread adoption.
This is in part due to the fact that most methods fail to maintain their
performance when they are called to make decisions on data that originate from
a different distribution than the one they were trained on, namely
Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. For example, in the case of biosignal
classification, models often fail to generalize well on datasets from different
hospitals, due to the distribution discrepancy amongst different sources of
data. Our goal is to demonstrate the Domain Generalization problem present
between distinct hospital databases and propose a method that classifies
abnormalities on 12-lead Electrocardiograms (ECGs), by leveraging information
extracted across the architecture of a Deep Neural Network, and capturing the
underlying structure of the signal. To this end, we adopt a ResNet-18 as the
backbone model and extract features from several intermediate convolutional
layers of the network. To evaluate our method, we adopt publicly available ECG
datasets from four sources and handle them as separate domains. To simulate the
distributional shift present in real-world settings, we train our model on a
subset of the domains and leave-out the remaining ones. We then evaluate our
model both on the data present at training time (intra-distribution) and the
held-out data (out-of-distribution), achieving promising results and surpassing
the baseline of a vanilla Residual Network in most of the cases.

NLP. Intuitively, sentential information is integrated into the representation
of words, which can help model polysemy. However, context sensitivity also
leads to the variance of representations, which may break the semantic
consistency for synonyms. We quantify how much the contextualized embeddings of
each word sense vary across contexts in typical pre-trained models. Results
show that contextualized embeddings can be highly consistent across contexts.
In addition, part-of-speech, number of word senses, and sentence length have an
influence on the variance of sense representations. Interestingly, we find that
word representations are position-biased, where the first words in different
contexts tend to be more similar. We analyze such a phenomenon and also propose
a simple way to alleviate such bias in distance-based word sense disambiguation

reflective metasurfaces, i.e., intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), which
can only serve receivers located on the same side of the transmitter, the IOS
can achieve full-dimensional wireless communications by enabling the
simultaneous reflection and refraction of the surface, and thus users on both
sides can be served. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the
state-of-the-art in IOS from the perspective of wireless communications, with
the emphasis on their design principles, channel modeling, beamforming design,
experimental implementation and measurements, as well as possible applications
in future cellular networks. We first describe the basic concepts of
metasurfaces, and introduce the corresponding design principles for different
types of metasurfaces. Moreover, we elaborate on the reflective-refractive
model for each IOS element and the channel model for IOS-aided wireless
communication systems. Furthermore, we show how to achieve full-dimensional
wireless communications with the IOS for three different scenarios. In

investigated using computational fluid dynamics and are coupled with a
multi-objective optimization algorithm to determine and propose optimal
solutions based on observed thermal resistance and pumping power. A workflow

Optimized solutions show a negligible difference in overall performance when

temperatures that are lower by more than 10% under the same pressure limits as
a convectional microchannel design. When limited by temperature, pressure drops

positive side, the detection in a certain frame of a video, compared with that
in a still image, can draw support from other frames. Hence, how to aggregate
features across different frames is pivotal to VID problem. Most of existing
aggregation algorithms are customized for two-stage detectors. However, these

This work proposes a simple yet effective strategy to address the above

Concretely, different from traditional two-stage pipeline, we select important
regions after the one-stage detection to avoid processing massive low-quality
candidates. Besides, we evaluate the relationship between a target frame and
reference frames to guide the aggregation. We conduct extensive experiments and
ablation studies to verify the efficacy of our design, and reveal its

has been extensively studied in the literature, and one of its key features is
that an additional communication network is required to achieve optimal power
allocation. Therefore, being able to provide stability guarantees in the
presence of communication delays is an important requirement. Primal-dual and
distributed averaging proportional-integral (DAPI) protocols, respectively, are
two main control schemes that have been proposed in the literature. Each has
its own relative merits, with the former allowing to incorporate general cost
functions and additional operational constraints, and the latter being more
straightforward in its implementation. Although delays have been addressed in
DAPI schemes, there are currently no theoretical guarantees for the stability
of primal-dual schemes for frequency control, when these are subject to
communication delays. In fact, simulations illustrate that even small delays
can destabilize such schemes. In this paper, we show how a novel formulation of
prima-dual schemes allows to construct a distributed algorithm with delay
independent stability guarantees. We also show that this algorithm can
incorporate many of the key features of these schemes such as tie-line power
flow requirements, generation constraints, and the relaxation of demand
measurements with an observer layer. Finally, we illustrate our results through

features are observed/measured for all model fitting, along with 5 random noise
features. Each sample size and censoring rate scenario is explored using 10,000
simulation datasets. Different statistical models are applied to the same
dataset to estimate feature effects. Model performance is compared using
sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of effect size ranking. RESULTS: When
features are independent and the true models are multivariate Cox proportional
hazards models, Gaussian regression of log-transformed survival time (response
variable) with only two covariates outperformed both the univariate Cox
proportional hazards model and logistic regression in feature selection, in
terms of not only higher sensitivity, comparable specificity, but also higher
accuracy of effect size ranking, regardless of the sample size and censoring
rate values. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study demonstrates the importance
of including Gaussian regression of log-transformed survival time in feature
selection practice for time-to-event outcomes.

  arXiv:2203.14126",,,,"cs.GT econ.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Min-max optimization problems (i.e., min-max games) have attracted a great
deal of attention recently as their applicability to a wide range of machine
learning problems has become evident. In this paper, we study min-max games
with dependent strategy sets, where the strategy of the first player constrains
the behavior of the second. Such games are best understood as sequential, i.e.,
Stackelberg, games, for which the relevant solution concept is Stackelberg
equilibrium, a generalization of Nash. One of the most popular algorithms for
solving min-max games is gradient descent ascent (GDA). We present a
straightforward generalization of GDA to min-max Stackelberg games with
dependent strategy sets, but show that it may not converge to a Stackelberg
equilibrium. We then introduce two variants of GDA, which assume access to a
solution oracle for the optimal Karush Kuhn Tucker (KKT) multipliers of the
games' constraints. We show that such an oracle exists for a large class of
convex-concave min-max Stackelberg games, and provide proof that our GDA
variants with such an oracle converge in $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2})$
iterations to an $\varepsilon$-Stackelberg equilibrium, improving on the most
efficient algorithms currently known which converge in
$O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^3})$ iterations. We then show that solving Fisher
markets, a canonical example of a min-max Stackelberg game, using our novel
algorithm, corresponds to buyers and sellers using myopic best-response
dynamics in a repeated market, allowing us to prove the convergence of these
dynamics in $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2})$ iterations in Fisher markets. We close
by describing experiments on Fisher markets which suggest potential ways to
extend our theoretical results, by demonstrating how different properties of
the objective function can affect the convergence and convergence rate of our
algorithms.

Simultaneously using the created NV centers as probes for their local

Nearly all single NV centers created in ultra-low-nitrogen-concentration

Furthermore, HTA strongly reduces noise sources naturally grown in ensemble
samples, and leads to more than three-fold improvements of decoherence time and
sensitivity. We also verify that the vacancy activation and defect reformation,
especially H3 and P1 centers, can explain the reconfiguration between spin
baths and color centers. This novel approach will become a powerful tool in
vacancy-based quantum technology.

multiple computer vision tasks, the state-of-the-art methods for representing
natural images need not necessarily perform well on images from other domains,

the distribution of data from across these domains, as compared to natural
images. Domains like sketch often contain sparse informative pixels. However,
recognizing objects in such domains is crucial, given multiple relevant
applications leveraging such data, for instance, sketch to image retrieval.
Thus, achieving an Embedding Learning model that could perform well across
multiple domains is not only challenging, but plays a pivotal role in computer
vision. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Embedding Learning
approach with the goal of generalizing across different domains. During
training, given a query image from a domain, we employ gated fusion and
attention to generate a positive example, which carries a broad notion of the
semantics of the query object category (from across multiple domains). By
virtue of Contrastive Learning, we pull the embeddings of the query and
positive, in order to learn a representation which is robust across domains. At
the same time, to teach the model to be discriminative against examples from
different semantic categories (across domains), we also maintain a pool of
negative embeddings (from different categories). We show the prowess of our
method using the DomainBed framework, on the popular PACS (Photo, Art painting,

a quantum system to make it free of decoherence. This problem can be
circumvented by the use of topological quantum phases of matter. These phases
have quasiparticles excitations called anyons. The anyons are charge-flux
composites and show exotic fractional statistics. When the order of exchange
matters, then the anyons are called non-Abelian anyons. Majorana fermions in
topological superconductors and quasiparticles in some quantum Hall states are
non-Abelian anyons. Such topological phases of matter have a ground state
degeneracy. The fusion of two or more non-Abelian anyons can result in a

by braiding and fusion of the non-Abelian anyons. The fault-tolerance is
achieved through the topological degrees of freedom of anyons. Such degrees of
freedom are non-local, hence inaccessible to the local perturbations. Ternary
logic gates are more compact than their binary counterparts and naturally arise
in a type of anyonic model called the metaplectic anyons. The mathematical

inflected Bengali vocabulary in the presence of spelling errors. We further
propose hybrid pretraining scheme for BSpell combining word level and character
level masking. Utilizing this pretraining scheme, BSpell achieves 91.5%
accuracy on real life Bengali spelling correction validation set. Detailed

  nomination: a new trimming method",,,,,"stat.ML cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As graph data becomes more ubiquitous, the need for robust inferential graph
algorithms to operate in these complex data domains is crucial. In many cases
of interest, inference is further complicated by the presence of adversarial
data contamination. The effect of the adversary is frequently to change the
data distribution in ways that negatively affect statistical and algorithmic
performance. We study this phenomenon in the context of vertex nomination, a
semi-supervised information retrieval task for network data. Here, a common
suite of methods relies on spectral graph embeddings, which have been shown to
provide both good algorithmic performance and flexible settings in which
regularization techniques can be implemented to help mitigate the effect of an
adversary. Many current regularization methods rely on direct network trimming
to effectively excise the adversarial contamination, although this direct
trimming often gives rise to complicated dependency structures in the resulting
graph. We propose a new trimming method that operates in model space which can
address both block structure contamination and white noise contamination
(contamination whose distribution is unknown). This model trimming is more
amenable to theoretical analysis while also demonstrating superior performance
in a number of simulations, compared to direct trimming.

ubiquity have created a fertile ground for fraud, assisted by the cross boarder

Volume of transactions, uniqueness of frauds and ingenuity of the fraudster are
main challenges in detecting frauds. The advent of machine learning, artificial

Given past transactions, a machine learning algorithm has the ability to
'learn' infinitely complex characteristics in order to identify frauds in
real-time, surpassing the best human investigators. However, the developments
in fraud detection algorithms has been challenging and slow due the massively
unbalanced nature of fraud data, absence of benchmarks and standard evaluation

confidential transaction data for research. This work investigates the
properties of typical massively imbalanced fraud data sets, their availability,

effect of PCA obfuscation (as a means of disseminating sensitive transaction

multi-hop underwater QKD where intermediate nodes between the source and

embedding function shall be open to the public, while the extraction function
could be performed only by legitimate users. The first algorithm is difference
expansion in single bit encrypted domain (DE-SBED), which is optimized from the
homomorphic embedding framework based on the bit operations of DE in spatial
domain. DE-SBED is suitable for the ciphertext of images encrypted from any
single bit encryption and learning with errors (LWE) encryption is selected in
this paper. Pixel value ordering is introduced to reduce the distortion of
decryption and improve the embedding rates (ER). To apply to more flexible
applications, public key recoding on encryption redundancy (PKR-ER) algorithm
is proposed. Public embedding key is constructed by recoding on the redundancy
from the probabilistic decryption of LWE. It is suitable for any plaintext
regardless of the type of medium or the content. By setting different
quantization rules for recoding, decryption and extraction functions are
separable. No distortion exists in the directly decrypted results of the marked
ciphertext and ER could reach over 1.0 bits per bit of plaintext. Correctness
and security of the algorithms are proved theoretically by deducing the
probability distributions of ciphertext and quantization variable. Experimental
results demonstrate the performances in correctness, one-way attribute of

through it and when current stops flowing through it, it remembers the state.
Thus, memristors are extremely suited for implementation of memory units.
Memristors find great application in neuromorphic circuits as it is possible to
couple memory and processing, compared to traditional Von-Neumann digital
architectures where memory and processing are separate. Neural networks have a
layered structure where information passes from one layer to another and each
of these layers have the possibility of a high degree of parallelism.
CMOS-Memristor based neural network accelerators provide a method of speeding
up neural networks by making use of this parallelism and analog computation. In
this project we have conducted an initial investigation into the current state
of the art implementation of memristor based programming circuits. Various
memristor programming circuits and basic neuromorphic circuits have been
simulated. The next phase of our project revolved around designing basic
building blocks which can be used to design neural networks. A memristor bridge
based synaptic weighting block, a operational transconductor based summing
block were initially designed. We then designed activation function blocks
which are used to introduce controlled non-linearity. Blocks for a basic
rectified linear unit and a novel implementation for tan-hyperbolic function
have been proposed. An artificial neural network has been designed using these
blocks to validate and test their performance. We have also used these
fundamental blocks to design basic layers of Convolutional Neural Networks.
Convolutional Neural Networks are heavily used in image processing
applications. The core convolutional block has been designed and it has been
used as an image processing kernel to test its performance.
