research initiative, was presented in the spring and fall semesters at the
University of Leeds in the United Kingdom at Stage@Leeds. The outcome of a
collaboration between dance artist A3 and theoretical physicist A2, under the
direction of performance researcher A1, Break-in' Point is based on a series of
real-life encounters at intersections of arts and science - exploring force,
risk, exposure and resilience. The Break-in' Point performance offered an
interrogation of the critical point at which physical, mental, and/or emotional
strength give way under stress - causing structural degeneration and the
experience of what lies beyond. This article is an examination of the
performance, reviewing and analysing it as an imagined somatic zone - embodied
encounters that transcend temporal bound-ness, compelling and igniting new
possibilities - that engaged spiritual and epistemological transformation of
performers and audiences. The article addresses three main periods in the life
of Break-in' Point: (1) the development period - script building and
rehearsals, (2) the performance - live encounters between and among performers
and audiences and (3) beyond the theatre - digital engagements in the classroom
and pedagogy. The article contributes new concepts and new ways of thinking
about science education, the role of digital technology in pedagogy,
dance/theatre public engagement and community arts practices as practices of
healing, health and resilience.

introduce a control algorithm that minimizes dynamic regret, i.e., that
minimizes the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that
knows the unpredictable future a priori. Specifically, our algorithm minimizes
the worst-case dynamic regret among all possible noise realizations given a
worst-case total noise magnitude. To this end, the control algorithm accounts
for three key challenges: safety constraints; partially-observed time-varying
systems; and unpredictable process and measurement noise. We are motivated by
the future of autonomy where robots will autonomously perform complex tasks
despite unknown and unpredictable disturbances leveraging their on-board
control and sensing capabilities. To synthesize our minimal-regret controller,
we formulate a constrained semi-definite program based on a System Level
Synthesis approach for partially-observed time-varying systems. We validate our
algorithm in simulated scenarios, including trajectory tracking scenarios of a
hovering quadrotor collecting GPS and IMU measurements. Our algorithm is
observed to have better performance than either or both the $\mathcal{H}_2$ and
$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ controllers, demonstrating a Best of Both Worlds

accretion disk, precessing with a period of about 35 days. The disk precession
allows for unique and changing sightlines towards the X-ray source. To
investigate the accretion flow at a variety of sightlines, we obtained a large
observational campaign on Her X-1 with XMM-Newton (380 ks exposure) and Chandra
(50 ks exposure) for a significant fraction of a single disk precession cycle,
resulting in one of the best datasets taken to date on a neutron star X-ray
binary. Here we present the spectral analysis of the High State high-resolution
grating and CCD datasets, including the extensive archival data available for
this famous system. The observations reveal a complex Fe K region structure,
with three emission line components of different velocity widths. Similarly,
the high-resolution soft X-ray spectra reveal a number of emission lines of
various widths. We correct for the uncertain gain of the EPIC-pn Timing mode
spectra, and track the evolution of these spectral components with Her X-1
precession phase and observed luminosity. We find evidence for three groups of
emission lines: one originates in the outer accretion disk (10^5 RG from the
neutron star). The second line group plausibly originates at the boundary
between the inner disk and the pulsar magnetosphere (10^3 RG). The last group
is too broad to arise in the magnetically-truncated disk and instead must
originate very close to the neutron star surface, likely from X-ray reflection
from the accretion curtain (~10^2 RG).

recently drawn increasing attention as the VFL matches the enterprises' demands

However, conventional VFL methods may run into data deficiency as they exploit
only aligned and labeled samples (belonging to different parties), leaving
often the majority of unaligned and unlabeled samples unused. The data
deficiency hampers the effort of the federation.
  In this work, we propose a Federated Hybrid Self-Supervised Learning
framework, named FedHSSL, that utilizes cross-party views (i.e., dispersed
features) of samples aligned among parties and local views (i.e., augmentation)
of unaligned samples within each party to improve the representation learning
capability of the VFL joint model. FedHSSL further exploits invariant features
across parties to boost the performance of the joint model through partial
model aggregation. FedHSSL, as a framework, can work with various
representative SSL methods. We empirically demonstrate that FedHSSL methods
outperform baselines by large margins. We provide an in-depth analysis of
FedHSSL regarding label leakage, which is rarely investigated in existing

typically is optimized manually by changing multiple control parameters, among
which are, for example, currents in the focusing and defocusing magnets along
the collider. It is generally challenging to model and predict losses based on
the control parameters due to various (non-linear) effects in the system, such
as electron clouds, resonance effects, etc, and multiple sources of
uncertainty. At the same time understanding the influence of control parameters
on the losses is extremely important in order to improve the operation and
performance, and future design of accelerators. Existing results showed that it
is hard to generalize the models, which assume the regression model of losses
depending on control parameters, from fills carried out throughout one year to
the data of another year. To circumvent this, we propose to use an
autoregressive modeling approach, where we take into account not only the
observed control parameters but also previous loss values. We use an equivalent

passages) from an initial pool of candidates are assigned new ranking scores.
The process enables the use of highly-effective but expensive scoring functions
that are not suitable for use directly in structures like inverted indices or
approximate nearest neighbour indices. However, re-ranking pipelines are
inherently limited by the recall of the initial candidate pool; documents that
are not identified as candidates for re-ranking by the initial retrieval
function cannot be identified. We propose a novel approach for overcoming the
recall limitation based on the well-established clustering hypothesis.
Throughout the re-ranking process, our approach adds documents to the pool that
are most similar to the highest-scoring documents up to that point. This
feedback process adapts the pool of candidates to those that may also yield
high ranking scores, even if they were not present in the initial pool. It can
also increase the score of documents that appear deeper in the pool that would
have otherwise been skipped due to a limited re-ranking budget. We find that
our Graph-based Adaptive Re-ranking (GAR) approach significantly improves the
performance of re-ranking pipelines in terms of precision- and recall-oriented
measures, is complementary to a variety of existing techniques (e.g., dense
retrieval), is robust to its hyperparameters, and contributes minimally to
computational and storage costs. For instance, on the MS MARCO passage ranking

  and relaxation to pilot-wave equilibrium","23 pages, 5 figures",,,,"quant-ph gr-qc hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Non-normalizable states are difficult to interpret in the orthodox quantum
formalism but often occur as solutions to physical constraints in quantum
gravity. We argue that pilot-wave theory gives a straightforward physical
interpretation of non-normalizable quantum states, as the theory requires only
a normalized density of configurations to generate statistical predictions. In
order to better understand such states, we conduct the first study of
non-normalizable solutions of the harmonic oscillator from a pilot-wave
perspective. We show that, contrary to intuitions from orthodox quantum
mechanics, the non-normalizable eigenstates and their superpositions are bound
states in the sense that the velocity field $v_y \to 0$ at large $\pm y$. We
argue that defining a physically meaningful equilibrium density for such states
requires a new notion of equilibrium, named pilot-wave equilibrium, which is a
generalisation of the notion of quantum equilibrium. We define a new
$H$-function $H_{pw}$, and prove that a density in pilot-wave equilibrium
minimises $H_{pw}$, is equivariant, and remains in equilibrium with time. We
prove, via an $H$-theorem for $H_{pw}$, that an arbitrary initial density
relaxes to pilot-wave equilibrium density at a coarse-grained level, under
assumptions similar to those for relaxation to quantum equilibrium. This
relaxation can also be recast in terms of a partial relaxation to quantum
equilibrium for an appropriate normalizable state evolving non-unitarily.
Lastly, we discuss the possibility of experimentally observing non-normalizable
states for realistic harmonic-oscillator potentials, applications in quantum

and zero total angular momentum $L=0$ is explored. It governs the
near-equilibrium $S$-states eigenfunctions $\psi(r_{12},r_{13},r_{23})$ of
three identical point particles interacting by means of any pairwise confining
potential $V(r_{12},r_{13},r_{23})$ that entirely depends on the relative
distances $r_{ij}=|{\mathbf r}_i-{\mathbf r}_j|$ between particles. At $R=0$,
the system admits a complete separation of variables in Jacobi-coordinates, it
is (maximally) superintegrable and exactly-solvable. The whole spectra of
excited states is degenerate, and to analyze it a detailed comparison between
two relevant Lie-algebraic representations of the corresponding reduced
Hamiltonian is carried out. At $R>0$, the problem is not even integrable nor
exactly-solvable and the degeneration is partially removed. In this case, no
exact solutions of the Schr\""odinger equation have been found so far whilst its
classical counterpart turns out to be a chaotic system. For $R>0$, accurate
values for the total energy $E$ of the lowest quantum states are obtained using
the Lagrange-mesh method. Concrete explicit results with not less than eleven
significant digits for the states $N=0,1,2,3$ are presented in the range $0\leq
R \leq 4.0$~a.u. . In particular, it is shown that (I) the energy curve
$E=E(R)$ develops a global minimum as a function of the rest length $R$, and it
tends asymptotically to a finite value at large $R$, and (II) the degenerate
states split into sub-levels. For the ground state, perturbative (small-$R$)
and two-parametric variational results (arbitrary $R$) are displayed as well.
An extension of the model with applications in molecular physics is briefly
discussed.

charge management when energy storage is used for multiple services, such as
optimal scheduling and frequency support, is one of the most notorious problems
in this context. To address this issue, an optimal energy management system is
proposed in this paper. It co-optimizes the primary frequency control layer and
the dispatch schedule of conventional generators and energy storage by taking
advantage of an algorithm that provides adaptive active power demand
uncertainty quantification, theoretical guarantees for frequency stability, and
bounds for the reserves for frequency support assigned to the energy storage

understand texts. Many works have been explored to include external knowledge
in the pre-trained models. These methods, generally, design pre-training tasks
and implicitly introduce knowledge by updating model weights, alternatively,
use it straightforwardly together with the original text. Though effective,
there are some limitations. On the one hand, it is implicit and only model
weights are paid attention to, the pre-trained entity embeddings are ignored.
On the other hand, entity descriptions may be lengthy, and inputting into the
model together with the original text may distract the model's attention. This
paper aims to explicitly include both entities and entity descriptions in the
fine-tuning stage. First, the pre-trained entity embeddings are fused with the
original text representation and updated by the backbone model layer by layer.
Second, descriptions are represented by the knowledge module outside the
backbone model, and each knowledge layer is selectively connected to one
backbone layer for fusing. Third, two knowledge-related auxiliary tasks, i.e.,
entity/description enhancement and entity enhancement/pollution task, are
designed to smooth the semantic gaps among evolved representations. We
conducted experiments on four knowledge-oriented tasks and two common tasks,
and the results achieved new state-of-the-art on several datasets. Besides, we
conduct an ablation study to show that each module in our method is necessary.

equations for fluid flows, also known as Navier-Stokes equations, on
discretized grid boxes in a three-dimensional space. It is a valuable paradigm
that has guided the numerical weather prediction models to compute rainfall
formation. However, DNS cannot be performed for large domains of practical
utility to the weather forecast community. Here, we introduce DeepClouds.ai, a
3D-UNET that simulates the outputs of a rising cloud DNS experiment. The
problem of increasing the domain size in DNS is addressed by mapping an inner
3D cube to the complete 3D cube from the output of the DNS discretized grid

having to solve the complex dynamical core. The baseline shows that the deep
learning-based simulation is comparable to the partial-differential

be used to further the science of turbulence and cloud flows by enabling
simulations over large physical domains in the atmosphere. It would lead to
cascading societal benefits by improved weather predictions via advanced

eruptions were triggered directly by fast reconnection in the pre-formed

eruption successfully. It has reasonable consistence with observations in
relative strength, energy release, X-ray and H{\alpha} features and time

the first eruption in the simulation is also close to the observed value. Our
simulation offers a scenario different from many previous studies based on
ideal instabilities of twisted magnetic flux rope, and shows the importance of
sunspot rotation and magnetic reconnection in efficiently producing homologous

Jacobson's\cite{ted95} identification of Einstein's equations with the

identify a quantum system whose hydrodynamics match those of a given
space-time. This can be done exactly for a system with any positive
cosmological constant, which saturates the entropy bound for all times. The
quantum system is a sequence of (cut-off) $1+1$ dimensional CFTs, with central
charge proportional to the entropy in causal diamonds along an FRW geodesic.
This matches with a recent\cite{BZ} proposal that the modular Hamiltonian of
any causal diamond for non-negative c.c. is the $L_0$ generator of such a CFT.
When an early de Sitter era is followed by slow roll expansion of the horizon,
disjoint horizon volumes (which are gauge copies in an eternal dS space, but
become physical due to slow roll expansion of the horizon area) manifest as a
dilute gas of black holes in a post-inflationary era. Entropy fluctuations of
individual black holes manifest as CMB fluctuations, and the tensor/scalar
ratio is suppressed by an extra factor of the slow roll parameter $\epsilon$.
Black hole evaporation provides the Hot Big Bang and baryogenesis. Black hole
mergers can easily provide a source of primordial BH dark matter that dominates
radiation at a temperature of $1$ eV, but numerical simulations are required to
determine whether the model can explain the actual dark matter in our universe.

object detection and image captioning tasks, existing methods typically employ
a two-stage framework: 1) detect the activity verb, and then 2) predict
semantic roles based on the detected verb. Obviously, this illogical framework
constitutes a huge obstacle to semantic understanding. First, pre-detecting
verbs solely without semantic roles inevitably fails to distinguish many
similar daily activities (e.g., offering and giving, buying and selling).
Second, predicting semantic roles in a closed auto-regressive manner can hardly
exploit the semantic relations among the verb and roles. To this end, in this
paper we propose a novel two-stage framework that focuses on utilizing such
bidirectional relations within verbs and roles. In the first stage, instead of
pre-detecting the verb, we postpone the detection step and assume a pseudo
label, where an intermediate representation for each corresponding semantic
role is learned from images. In the second stage, we exploit transformer layers
to unearth the potential semantic relations within both verbs and semantic
roles. With the help of a set of support images, an alternate learning scheme
is designed to simultaneously optimize the results: update the verb using nouns
corresponding to the image, and update nouns using verbs from support images.
Extensive experimental results on challenging SWiG benchmarks show that our
renovated framework outperforms other state-of-the-art methods under various

the behaviour of the walk is typically not periodic. In consequence we can
usually only compute numerical approximations to parameters of the walk. In
this paper, we develop theory to exactly study any quantum walk generated by an
integral Hamiltonian. As a result, we provide exact methods to compute the

study geometric properties of beautiful curves arising from entries of the
quantum walk matrix, and discuss possible applications of these results.

eccentric orbit, the mass transfer occurs at the periastron where the WD fills
its Roche lobe. The ultraluminous X-ray flares can be produced by the accretion

radio bursts (hereafter FRBs) were also found in extragalactic globular

logistic regression models at the individual level with mobility as a binary
outcome. It was found that 53% of the females did not report going out of home
compared to only 14% males. The mobility of females reduces steeply from
adolescence to young adulthood and then remains largely stable at a low level
before reducing further for older adults. No such variation is observed among

men mostly involved in out-of-home activities. Adolescence or adulthood,

in nonlinear random vibration analysis is that they are approximate by their
nature. A quantity of interest estimated from an ELM has no guarantee to be the
same as the solution of the original nonlinear system. In this study, we tackle
this fundamental limitation. We sequentially address the following two
questions: i) given an equivalent linear system obtained from any ELM, how do
we construct an estimator so that, as the linear system simulations are guided
by a limited number of nonlinear system simulations, the estimator converges on
the nonlinear system solution? ii) how to construct an optimized equivalent
linear system such that the estimator approaches the nonlinear system solution
as quickly as possible? The first question is theoretically straightforward
since classical Monte Carlo techniques such as the control variates and
importance sampling can improve upon the solution of any surrogate model. We
adapt the well-known Monte Carlo theories into the specific context of
equivalent linearization. The second question is challenging, especially when
rare event probabilities are of interest. We develop specialized methods to
construct and optimize linear systems. In the context of uncertainty
quantification (UQ), the proposed optimized ELM can be viewed as a physical
surrogate model-based UQ method. The embedded physical equations endow the
surrogate model with the capability to handle high-dimensional random vectors
in stochastic dynamics analysis.

perform fits to the $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-$ data base and study the consequences
for the two-pion HVP contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon,
its IB part due to $\rho$-$\omega$ mixing, and the mass of the $\omega$

generalization of this quantity to mixed states - known as the ensemble
geometric phase (EGP) - has emerged as a robust way to describe topology at

allowed for dissipation beyond a Lindblad description, to allow for coupling to
external baths at finite temperatures. We introduce two main aspects to the
theory of mixed state topology. First, we discover topological phase
transitions as a function of the temperature T, manifesting as changes in
winding number of the EGP accumulated over a closed loop in parameter space. We
characterize the nature of these transitions and reveal that the corresponding
non-equilibrium steady state at the transition can exhibit a nontrivial
structure - contrary to previous studies where it was found to be in a fully
mixed state. Second, we demonstrate that the EGP itself becomes quantized when
key symmetries are present, allowing it to be viewed as a topological marker
which can undergo equilibrium topological transitions at non-zero temperatures.

high frequencies, the driven system stroboscopically attains a Floquet-type
Gibbs state at the reservoir temperature. At low frequencies, a synchronised
Gibbs state emerges, whose temperature may depart significantly from that of
the reservoir. Although our analysis in some parts relies on the specific

stroboscopic behaviours of a classical spin chain that is driven by a periodic
magnetic field and coupled to a thermal reservoir. We detail and expand our
previous work: we investigate the significance of higher-order corrections to
the classical Floquet-Magnus expansion in both the high- and low-frequency
regimes; explicitly probe the evolution the dynamics of the reservoir; and
further explore how the driven system synchronises with the applied field at
low frequencies. In line with our earlier results, we find that the
high-frequency regime is characterised by a local Floquet-Gibbs ensemble with
the reservoir acting as a nearly-reversible heatsink. At low frequencies, the
driven system rapidly enters a synchronised state, which can only be fully
described in a global picture accounting for the concurrent relaxation of the
reservoir in a fictitious magnetic field arising from the drive. We highlight
how the evolving nature of the reservoir may still be incorporated in a local
picture by introducing an effective temperature. Finally, we argue that
dissipative equations of motion for periodically-driven many-body systems, at

discovered during the follow-up of S191213g, a gravitational wave (GW) event
reported by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration as a possible binary neutron star
merger in a low latency search. This search yielded SN2019wxt, a young
transient in a galaxy whose sky position (in the 80\% GW contour) and distance
($\sim$150\,Mpc) were plausibly compatible with the localisation uncertainty of
the GW event. Initially, the transient's tightly constrained age, its
relatively faint peak magnitude ($M_i \sim -16.7$\,mag) and the $r-$band
decline rate of $\sim 1$\,mag per 5\,days appeared suggestive of a compact
binary merger. However, SN2019wxt spectroscopically resembled a type Ib
supernova, and analysis of the optical-near-infrared evolution rapidly led to
the conclusion that while it could not be associated with S191213g, it
nevertheless represented an extreme outcome of stellar evolution. By modelling
the light curve, we estimated an ejecta mass of $\sim 0.1\,M_\odot$, with
$^{56}$Ni comprising $\sim 20\%$ of this. We were broadly able to reproduce its
spectral evolution with a composition dominated by helium and oxygen, with
trace amounts of calcium. We considered various progenitors that could give
rise to the observed properties of SN2019wxt, and concluded that an
ultra-stripped origin in a binary system is the most likely explanation.
Disentangling electromagnetic counterparts to GW events from transients such as
SN2019wxt is challenging: in a bid to characterise the level of contamination,
we estimated the rate of events with properties comparable to those of
SN2019wxt and found that $\sim 1$ such event per week can occur within the
typical GW localisation area of O4 alerts out to a luminosity distance of
500\,Mpc, beyond which it would become fainter than the typical depth of
current electromagnetic follow-up campaigns.

protection has a physically transparent mechanism: the extending UV symmetry
operations pump lower dimensional SPTs onto the igSPT edge, tuning the edge to
a (multi)critical point between different SPTs protected by the IR symmetry. In
two- and three- dimensional systems, an additional possibility is that the
emergent anomaly can be satisfied by an anomalous symmetry-enriched topological

atomic scattering by dark matter (DM), this is known as the Migdal effect, but
the same effect has also been studied in molecules in the chemistry and neutron
scattering literature. Here we present two distinct Migdal-like effects from DM
scattering in molecules, which we collectively refer to as the molecular Migdal
effect: a center-of-mass recoil, equivalent to the standard Migdal treatment,
and a non-adiabatic coupling resulting from corrections to the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation. The molecular bonds break spherical symmetry, leading to large
daily modulation in the Migdal rate from anisotropies in the matrix elements.
Our treatment reduces to the standard Migdal effect in atomic systems but does
not rely on the impulse approximation or any semiclassical treatments of
nuclear motion, and as such may be extended to models where DM scatters through
a long-range force. We demonstrate all of these features in a few simple toy
models of diatomic molecules, namely ${\rm H}_2^+$, N$_2$, and CO, and find
total molecular Migdal rates competitive with those in semiconductors for the
same target mass. We discuss how our results may be extended to more realistic
targets comprised of larger molecules which could be deployed at the kilogram

identified with a photometric redshift $z_{phot} = 6.2 \pm 0.1$ based on images
taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. Here we present James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) images of Earendel in 8 filters

single unresolved point source on the lensing critical curve, increasing the
lower limit on the lensing magnification to $\mu > 4000$ and restricting the
source plane radius further to $r < 0.02$ pc, or $\sim 4000$ AU. These new
observations strengthen the conclusion that Earendel is best explained by an
individual star or multiple star system, and support the previous photometric
redshift estimate. Fitting grids of stellar spectra to our photometry yields a
stellar temperature of $T_{\mathrm{eff}} \simeq 13000$--16000 K assuming the
light is dominated by a single star. The delensed bolometric luminosity in this
case ranges from $\log(L) = 5.8$--6.6 $L_{\odot}$, which is in the range where
one expects luminous blue variable stars. Follow-up observations, including
JWST NIRSpec scheduled for late 2022, are needed to further unravel the nature
of this object, which presents a unique opportunity to study massive stars in
the first billion years of the universe.

  galaxies","15 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication by MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stac2355",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We investigate archaeologically how the metallicity in both stellar and
gaseous components of spiral galaxies of differing masses evolve with time,
using data from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. For the stellar component, we can
measure this evolution directly by decomposing the galaxy absorption-line
spectra into populations of different ages and determining their metallicities.
For the gaseous component, we can only measure the present-day metallicity
directly from emission lines. However, there is a well-established relationship
between gas metallicity, stellar mass and star formation rate which does not
evolve significantly with redshift; since the latter two quantities can be
determined directly for any epoch from the decomposition of the absorption-line
spectra, we can use this relationship to infer the variation in gas metallicity
over cosmic time. Comparison of present-day values derived in this way with
those obtained directly from the emission lines confirms the validity of the
method. Application of this approach to a sample of 1619 spiral galaxies
reveals how the metallicity of these systems has changed over the last 10
billion years since cosmic noon. For lower-mass galaxies, both stellar and
gaseous metallicity increase together, as one might expect in well-mixed fairly
isolated systems. In higher-mass systems, the average stellar metallicity has
not increased in step with the inferred gas metallicity, and actually decreases
with time. Such disjoint behaviour is what one might expect if these more
massive systems have accreted significant amounts of largely pristine gas over
their lifetimes, and this material has not been well mixed into the galaxies.

S191213g was not confirmed as a significant GW event in the off-line analysis
of LIGO-Virgo data, AT2019wxt remained an interesting transient due its
peculiar nature. The optical/NIR light curve of AT2019wxt displayed a
double-peaked structure evolving rapidly in a manner analogous to currently
know ultra-stripped supernovae (USSNe) candidates. This double-peaked structure
suggests presence of an extended envelope around the progenitor, best modelled
with two-components: i) early-time shock-cooling emission and ii) late-time
radioactive $^{56}$Ni decay. We constrain the ejecta mass of AT2019wxt at
$M_{ej} \approx{0.20 M_{\odot}}$ which indicates a significantly stripped
progenitor that was possibly in a binary system. We also followed-up AT2019wxt
with long-term Chandra and Jansky Very Large Array observations spanning
$\sim$260 days. We detected no definitive counterparts at the location of
AT2019wxt in these long-term X-ray and radio observational campaigns. We
establish the X-ray upper limit at $9.93\times10^{-17}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$

there is little evidence for SN1993J- or GW170817-like variability of the radio

technology with broad applicability and advocated as a de-facto standard for
releasing aggregate statistics on sensitive data. However, in many embodiments,
DP introduces a new attack surface: a malicious entity entrusted with releasing

verifier must validate that DP randomness was generated faithfully without
learning anything about the randomness itself. We resolve this paradox by
carefully mixing private and public randomness to compute verifiable DP

high-$z$ quasars are partially sourced from spatial fluctuations in the
ultraviolet background (UVB), the level of which are set by the mean free path
of ionizing photons ($\lambda_{\text{mfp}}$). The auto-correlation function of
Ly$\alpha$ forest flux characterizes the strength and scale of transmission
fluctuations and, as we show, is thus sensitive to $\lambda_{\text{mfp}}$.
Recent measurements at $z \sim 6$ suggest a rapid evolution of
$\lambda_{\text{mfp}}$ at $z>5.0$ which would leave a signature in the
evolution of the auto-correlation function. For this forecast, we model mock
Ly$\alpha$ forest data with properties similar to the XQR-30 extended data set
at $5.4 \leq z \leq 6.0$. At each $z$ we investigate 100 mock data sets and an
ideal case where mock data matches model values of the auto-correlation
function. For ideal data with $\lambda_{\text{mfp}}=9.0$ cMpc at $z=6.0$, we
recover $\lambda_{\text{mfp}}=12^{+6}_{-3}$ cMpc. This precision is comparable
to direct measurements of $\lambda_{\text{mfp}}$ from the stacking of quasar
spectra beyond the Lyman limit. Hypothetical high-resolution data leads to a
$\sim40\%$ reduction in the error bars over all $z$. The distribution of mock
values of the auto-correlation function in this work is highly non-Gaussian for
high-$z$, which should caution work with other statistics of the high-$z$
Ly$\alpha$ forest against making this assumption. We use a rigorous statistical
method to pass an inference test, however future work on non-Gaussian methods

quadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a

attention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as
sparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we
view attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use
decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per
query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such
hierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two
efficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention
computes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse
attention layer which also ensures that the gradients are ""dense"". To optimize
such challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training
method. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for
long-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost
as accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the
attention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12%
higher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.

representations with ``holes'' of invalid samples, here we propose a novel
extension to the training procedure which promotes a dense latent space, and
allows the model to sample valid molecules from random perturbations of latent
codes. We provide a thorough comparison of MolMIM to several variable-size and
fixed-size encoder-decoder models, demonstrating MolMIM's superior generation
as measured in terms of validity, uniqueness, and novelty. We then utilize
CMA-ES, a naive black-box and gradient free search algorithm, over MolMIM's
latent space for the task of property guided molecule optimization. We achieve
state-of-the-art results in several constrained single property optimization

improving over previous success rate SOTA by more than 5\% . We attribute the
strong results to MolMIM's latent representation which clusters similar

  Consistency Regularization",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Open-World Instance Segmentation (OWIS) is an emerging research topic that
aims to segment class-agnostic object instances from images. The mainstream
approaches use a two-stage segmentation framework, which first locates the
candidate object bounding boxes and then performs instance segmentation. In
this work, we instead promote a single-stage framework for OWIS. We argue that
the end-to-end training process in the single-stage framework can be more
convenient for directly regularizing the localization of class-agnostic object
pixels. Based on the single-stage instance segmentation framework, we propose a
regularization model to predict foreground pixels and use its relation to
instance segmentation to construct a cross-task consistency loss. We show that
such a consistency loss could alleviate the problem of incomplete instance
annotation -- a common problem in the existing OWIS datasets. We also show that
the proposed loss lends itself to an effective solution to semi-supervised OWIS
that could be considered an extreme case that all object annotations are absent
for some images. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves impressive results in both fully-supervised and semi-supervised
settings. Compared to SOTA methods, the proposed method significantly improves
the $AP_{100}$ score by 4.75\% in UVO$\rightarrow$UVO setting and 4.05\% in
COCO$\rightarrow$UVO setting. In the case of semi-supervised learning, our
model learned with only 30\% labeled data, even outperforms its
fully-supervised counterpart with 50\% labeled data. The code will be released
soon.

which results in indistinguishable node representations and low model
performance with more GNN layers. Many methods have been put forward to tackle
this problem in recent years. However, existing tackling over-smoothing methods
emphasize model performance and neglect the over-smoothness of node
representations. Additional, different approaches are applied one at a time,
while there lacks an overall framework to jointly leverage multiple solutions
to the over-smoothing challenge. To solve these problems, we propose GraTO, a
framework based on neural architecture search to automatically search for GNNs
architecture. GraTO adopts a novel loss function to facilitate striking a
balance between model performance and representation smoothness. In addition to
existing methods, our search space also includes DropAttribute, a novel scheme
for alleviating the over-smoothing challenge, to fully leverage diverse
solutions. We conduct extensive experiments on six real-world datasets to
evaluate GraTo, which demonstrates that GraTo outperforms baselines in the
over-smoothing metrics and achieves competitive performance in accuracy. GraTO
is especially effective and robust with increasing numbers of GNN layers.
Further experiments bear out the quality of node representations learned with
GraTO and the effectiveness of model architecture. We make cide of GraTo

space and network bandwidth, which has been widely used in cloud storage.
Recently, a number of schemes that solve the problem of data deduplication with
dynamic ownership management have been proposed. However, these schemes suffer
from low efficiency when the dynamic ownership changes a lot. To this end, in
this paper, we propose a novel server-side deduplication scheme for encrypted

communication overhead we use an initial uploader check mechanism to ensure
only the first uploader needs to perform encryption, and adopt an access
control technique that verifies the validity of the data users before they
download data. Our security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate
that our proposed server-side deduplication scheme has better performance in
terms of security, effectiveness, and practicability compared with previous
schemes. Meanwhile, our method can efficiently resist collusion attacks and

solids that is necessary to form the planets in their present locations. While
most previous studies have fit a single power-law to all exoplanets in an
observed ensemble, it is unclear whether most exoplanetary systems form from a
universal disk template. We use an advanced statistical model for the
underlying architectures of multi-planet systems to reconstruct the MMEN. The
simulated physical and Kepler-observed catalogs allows us to directly assess
the role of detection biases, and in particular the effect of non-transiting or
otherwise undetected planets, in altering the inferred MMEN. We find that
fitting a power-law of the form $\Sigma = \Sigma_0^* (a/a_0)^\beta$ to each
multi-planet system results in a broad distribution of disk profiles;
$\Sigma_0^* = 336_{-291}^{+727}$ g/cm$^2$ and $\beta = -1.98_{-1.52}^{+1.55}$
encompass the 16th-84th percentiles of the marginal distributions in an
underlying population, where $\Sigma_0^*$ is the normalization at $a_0 = 0.3$
AU. Around half of inner planet-forming disks have minimum solid masses of
$\gtrsim 40 M_\oplus$ within 1 AU. While transit observations do not tend to
bias the median $\beta$, they can lead to both significantly over- and
under-estimated $\Sigma_0^*$ and thus broaden the inferred distribution of disk
masses. Nevertheless, detection biases cannot account for the full variance in
the observed disk profiles; there is no universal MMEN if all planets formed in
situ. The great diversity of solid disk profiles suggests that a substantial
fraction ($\gtrsim 23\%$) of planetary systems experienced a history of
migration.

without numbers, in which the covariation between geometric variables,
constrained by ruler and compass constructions or with other geometric
constructions, can be expressed with symbolic equations. By using algebraic
manipulations, it is possible to easily deduce the properties of the

constructing the de Sitter super-conformal gravity and Quantum gravity. $10$
gauge vector fields are needed, corresponding to $10$ generators of the de
Sitter group. Using the gauge-invariant Lagrangian, the field equation of these
vector fields has been obtained. The gauge vector field solutions are recalled.
Then, the spin-$2$ gauge potentials are constructed from the gauge vector
field. There are two possibilities for presenting this tensor field: rank-$2$
symmetric and mixed symmetry rank-$3$ tensor fields. To preserve the conformal
transformation, a spin-$2$ field must be represented by a mixed symmetry
rank-$3$ tensor field, $\mathcal {K}_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$. This tensor field
has been rewritten using a generalized polarization tensor field and a de
Sitter plane wave. This generalized polarization tensor field has been
calculated as a combination of vector polarization, $\mathcal {E}_{\alpha}$,
and tensor polarization of rank-$2$, $\mathcal {E}_{\alpha\beta}$, which can be
used in the gravitational wave consideration. For the construction of this
polarization tensor, the arbitrary constant vector fields appear. We fix it so
that, in the limit, $H=0$, one obtains the polarization tensor in Minkowski
space-time. It has been shown that under some simple conditions, the spin-$2$
mixed symmetry rank-$3$ tensor field can be simultaneously transformed by the
unitary irreducible representation of de Sitter and conformal groups,

""proto""-magnetars drive neutrino-heated magneto-centrifugal winds. Using a
suite of two-dimensional axisymmetric MHD simulations, we show that relatively
slowly rotating magnetars with initial spin periods of $P_{\star0}=50-500$ ms
spin down rapidly during the neutrino Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling epoch. These
initial spin periods are representative of those inferred for normal Galactic
pulsars, and much slower than those invoked for gamma-ray bursts and
super-luminous supernovae. Since the flow is non-relativistic at early times,
and because the Alfv\'en radius is much larger than the proto-magnetar radius,
spindown is millions of times more efficient than the typically-used dipole
formula. Quasi-periodic plasmoid ejections from the closed zone enhance
spindown. For polar magnetic field strengths $B_0\gtrsim5\times10^{14}$ G, the
spindown timescale can be shorter than than the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale. For
$B_0\gtrsim10^{15}$ G, it is of order seconds in early phases. We compute the
spin evolution for cooling proto-magnetars as a function of $B_0$,
$P_{\star0}$, and mass ($M$). Proto-magnetars born with $B_0$ greater than
$\simeq1.3\times10^{15}\,{\rm\,G}\,(P_{\star0}/{400\,\rm\,ms})^{-1.4}(M/1.4\,{\rm
M}_\odot)^{2.2}$ spin down to periods $> 1$ s in just the first few seconds of
evolution, well before the end of the cooling epoch and the onset of classic
dipole spindown. Spindown is more efficient for lower $M$ and for larger
$P_{\star0}$. We discuss the implications for observed magnetars, including the
discrepancy between their characteristic ages and supernova remnant ages.

the existence of magnetic monopoles, which forms an essential part of
Staruszkiewicz's Quantum Mechanics of the Electric Charge)
  Ultra-high energy (UHE) photons with energies exceeding $10^{18}\eV$ can
potentially be observed. They are produced in various processes involving
electrically charged particles. However, more exotic scenarios are also
possible. UHE photons could be emitted in encounters of massive magnetically
charged monopole--antimonopole pairs or in processes associated with monopoles
accelerated to high energies, typically $10^{21}\eV$ or beyond. Observing UHE
photons can pose constraints on the properties of magnetic monopoles.
  There are compelling theoretical reasons in favor of the presence of magnetic
monopoles in nature. The predicted observational signatures of these particles
are therefore searched for in dedicated experiments currently in operation.
Despite these attempts, magnetic monopoles have yet to be empirically proved.
  There are also theoretical reasons why magnetic monopoles allowed by Dirac's
theory might not be realized in nature in the form of isolated particles.
Detection or non-detection of UHE photon signatures of magnetic monopoles would
bring us closer to solving this fascinating puzzle.

  high dimensions?",,,,,"math.NA cs.LG cs.NA math.FA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper concerns the approximation of smooth, high-dimensional functions
from limited samples using polynomials. This task lies at the heart of many
applications in computational science and engineering -- notably, those arising
from parametric modelling and uncertainty quantification. It is common to use
Monte Carlo (MC) sampling in such applications, so as not to succumb to the
curse of dimensionality. However, it is well known this strategy is
theoretically suboptimal. There are many polynomial spaces of dimension $n$ for
which the sample complexity scales log-quadratically in $n$. This
well-documented phenomenon has led to a concerted effort to design improved, in
fact, near-optimal strategies, whose sample complexities scale log-linearly, or
even linearly in $n$.
  Paradoxically, in this work we show that MC is actually a perfectly good
strategy in high dimensions. We first document this phenomenon via several
numerical examples. Next, we present a theoretical analysis that resolves this
paradox for holomorphic functions of infinitely-many variables. We show that
there is a least-squares scheme based on $m$ MC samples whose error decays
algebraically fast in $m/\log(m)$, with a rate that is the same as that of the
best $n$-term polynomial approximation. This result is non-constructive, since
it assumes knowledge of a suitable polynomial space in which to perform the
approximation. We next present a compressed sensing-based scheme that achieves
the same rate, except for a larger polylogarithmic factor. This scheme is
practical, and numerically it performs as well as or better than well-known
adaptive least-squares schemes.
  Overall, our findings demonstrate that MC sampling is eminently suitable for
smooth function approximation when the dimension is sufficiently high. Hence
the benefits of improved sampling strategies are generically limited to
lower-dimensional settings.

approximate the optimal solutions of constrained optimization problems. This is
an empirical risk minimization under constraints, which is challenging as
training must balance optimality and feasibility conditions. Supervised
learning methods often approach this challenge by training the model on a large
collection of pre-solved instances. This paper takes a different route and
proposes the idea of Primal-Dual Learning (PDL), a self-supervised training
method that does not require a set of pre-solved instances or an optimization
solver for training and inference. Instead, PDL mimics the trajectory of an
Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) and jointly trains primal and dual neural
networks. Being a primal-dual method, PDL uses instance-specific penalties of
the constraint terms in the loss function used to train the primal network.
Experiments show that, on a set of nonlinear optimization benchmarks, PDL
typically exhibits negligible constraint violations and minor optimality gaps,
and is remarkably close to the ALM optimization. PDL also demonstrated improved
or similar performance in terms of the optimality gaps, constraint violations,
and training times compared to existing approaches.

resolution-dependent neural-network dictionaries, here we develop a pair of
models in $\mathbb{R}^3$, regardless of the mesh size. Our feedforward networks
ingest transformed level-set, gradient, and curvature data to fix numerical
mean-curvature approximations selectively for interface nodes. To reduce the
problem's complexity, we have used the Gaussian curvature to classify stencils
and fit our models separately to non-saddle and saddle patterns. Non-saddle
stencils are easier to handle because they exhibit a curvature error
distribution characterized by monotonicity and symmetry. While the latter has
allowed us to train only on half the mean-curvature spectrum, the former has
helped us blend the data-driven and the baseline estimations seamlessly near
flat regions. On the other hand, the saddle-pattern error structure is less
clear; thus, we have exploited no latent information beyond what is known. In
this regard, we have trained our models on not only spherical but also
sinusoidal and hyperbolic paraboloidal patches. Our approach to building their
data sets is systematic but gleans samples randomly while ensuring
well-balancedness. We have also resorted to standardization and dimensionality
reduction and integrated regularization to minimize outliers. In addition, we
leverage curvature rotation/reflection invariance to improve precision at
inference time. Several experiments confirm that our proposed system can yield
more accurate mean-curvature estimations than modern particle-based interface
reconstruction and level-set schemes around under-resolved regions.

found, 57 of which were reported to the Transient Name Server for the first
time and with 47 having previously been mentioned in other catalogues, either
as SNe with known types or as SN candidates. We visually inspected the
multi-colour light curves of the non-catalogued transients and performed
fittings with different supernova models to assign it to a probable photometric

a few other non-catalogued objects, such as red dwarf flares and active
galactic nuclei. Beyond confirming the effectiveness of human-machine
integration underlying the AAD strategy, our results shed light on potential
leaks in currently available pipelines. These findings can help avoid similar
losses in future large-scale astronomical surveys. Furthermore, the algorithm
enables direct searches of any type of data and based on any definition of an

of solar coronal and solar wind fluctuations at scales of around an hour is not
entirely understood. Several existing theories aim at explaining it, involving
both linear and nonlinear mechanisms. An often overlooked property of the solar
corona and solar wind is their highly inhomogeneous nature. In this paper we
investigate the linear evolution of pure Alfv\'en and surface Alfv\'en waves
propagating through a plasma which is inhomogeneous across the magnetic field.
The inhomogeneity is given by density, which we model to be two-dimensional
colored noise, with power spectral slopes ranging from -2 to -1. Alfv\'en waves
propagate independently on individual magnetic field lines, and eventually get
completely out of phase through the process of phase mixing, leading to
unrealistic spectra. When the coupling between the inhomogeneous background and
the propagating waves is fully accounted for, transverse waves such as surface
Alfv\'en waves (also referred to as kink or Alfv\'enic) appear, showing
collective wave behavior of neighboring magnetic field lines with different
Alfv\'en speeds. We show that the linear cascade of surface Alfv\'en wave
energy, induced by phase mixing and resonant absorption, leads to a
perpendicular wave energy spectrum which tends to the perpendicular power
spectrum of the background density. Based on our model, we propose that a
perpendicular density power spectrum of 1/f in the solar corona can induce,
through linear processes, the 1/f spectrum of the fluctuations that is observed
at the largest scales.

repelling atomic anions through the formation of two-center positronic bonds.
In the present work, we study the energetic stability of a system containing
two positrons and three hydride anions, namely 2\ce{e^+[H^{3-}_3]}. To this
aim, we performed a preliminary scan of the potential energy surface of the
system with both electrons and positron in a spin singlet state, with a
multi-component MP2 method, that was further refined with variational and
diffusion Monte Carlo calculations, and confirmed an equilibrium geometry with
\ce{D_${3h}$} symmetry. The local stability of 2\ce{e^+[H^{3-}_3]} is
demonstrated by analyzing the vertical detachment and adiabatic energy
dissociation channels. Bonding properties of the positronic compound, such as
the equilibrium interatomic distances, force constants, dissociation energies,
and bonding densities are compared with those of the purely electronic
\ce{H^+_3} and \ce{Li^+_3} systems. Through this analysis, we find compelling
similarities between the 2\ce{e^+[H^{3-}_3]} compound and the trilithium
cation. Our results strongly point out the formation of a non-electronic
three-center two-positron bond, analogous to the well known three-center
two-electron counterparts, which is fundamentally distinct from the two-center
two-positron bond [D. Bressanini, \textit{J. Chem. Phys.} \textbf{155}, 054306
(2021)], thus extending the concept of positron bonded molecules.

aim is to merge these two strands, enabling the development of quantum-limited

$S_{xy}(\omega)$ offer new possibilities: once detector misalignment errors are
minimised, the spectral shape of $S_{xy}(\omega)$ directly points out the
orientation of an external stochastic force, offering something akin to a
compass in the $x-y$ plane. We analyse this for detection of microscopic gas
currents, but any broad spectrum directed force will suffice, enabling
straightforward investigation with laboratory test forces with or without
cavities. For a cavity set-up, we analyse misalignment imprecisions between
detectors and motional modes due to for example optical back-actions that mask
the signature of the directed forces, and show how to suppress them. Near
quantum regimes, we quantify the imprecision due to the $x-y$ correlating
effect of quantum shot noise imprecision.

intrinsic demand uncertainty. We consider a rolling order-fulfilment context

existing unfulfilled orders and future incoming requests to minimize the total
expected delays in package delivery. The considered uncertainty includes the
stochastic arrival of delivery requests, their types, locations/delivery
distances, and associated penalties for late delivery. Due to the constrained
service capacity, the size of the problem grows exponentially as the number of
simulated scenarios increases. In this study, we propose a modified integer
L-shaped method, which (i) significantly reduces the number of nodes in the
branching tree, and (ii) simplifies the computation of optimality cuts. The
computational results show that these two modifications improve the average
running time by roughly 10 times and 1,000 times compared to the non-customized

linearly growing computational speed in response to the number of scenarios
enables it as a viable solution for large-sized problems in reality.

serves as an artificial model system capable of mimicking microbial swimmers.
Either an interfacial chemical reaction or the process of solubilization
generates gradients in interfacial tension resulting in a Marangoni flow. The
resulting fluid flow propels the droplet toward a region of lower interfacial
tension. The advective transport of surfactants sustains the active propulsion
of these droplets. In these systems, the local interfacial tension is affected
by the interfacial reaction kinetics as well as convection and diffusion
induced concentration gradients. The migration of such a surfactant-laden
viscous droplet undergoing an interfacial reaction, suspended in a background
Poiseuille flow is investigated. The focus is specifically on the role of the
surface reaction that generates a non-uniform interfacial coverage of the
surfactant, which in turn dictates the migration velocity of the droplet in the
background flow. Assuming negligible interface deformation and fluid inertia,
the Lorentz reciprocal theorem is used to analytically determine the migration
velocity of the droplet using regular perturbation expansion in terms of the
surface P\'eclet number. We show that the presence of interfacial reaction
affects the magnitude of both stream-wise and cross-stream migration velocity
of the droplet in a background Poiseuille flow. We conclude that the
stream-wise migration velocity is not of sufficient strength to exhibit
positive rheotaxis as observed in recent experimental observations. Additional
effects such as the hydrodynamic interactions with the adjacent wall may be
essential to capture the same.

response of proximity coupled superconducting island arrays by comparing
scanning Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) susceptibility
measurements to a model in which we treat the system as a network of
one-dimensional (1D) superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS) Josephson
junctions, each with a Josephson coupling energy $E_J$ determined by the
junction length or distance between islands. We find that the disordered arrays
exhibit a spatially inhomogeneous diamagnetic response which, for low local
applied magnetic fields, is well described by this junction network model, and
we discuss these results as they relate to inhomogeneous two-dimensional (2D)
superconductors. Our model of the static magnetic response of the arrays does
not fully capture the onset of nonlinearity and dissipation with increasing
applied field, as these effects are associated with vortex motion due to the
dynamic nature of the scanning SQUID susceptometry measurement. This work
demonstrates a model 2D superconducting system with engineered disorder and
highlights the impact of dissipation on the local magnetic properties of 2D
superconductors and Josephson junction arrays.

we study three of the most common agricultural problems and model them through
optimization techniques, showing ways to assess conflicting objectives together
as a system and provide overall optimum solutions. The studied problems refer
to: i) a water-scarce area with overexploited surface and groundwater resources
due to over-pumping for irrigation (Central Greece), ii) a water-abundant area
with issues of water quality deterioration caused by agriculture (Southern
Ontario, Canada), iii) and a case of intensified agriculture based on animal
farming that causes issues of water, soil quality degradation, and increased
greenhouse gases emissions (Central Ireland). Linear, non-linear, and Goal
Programming optimization techniques have been developed and applied for each
case to maximize farmers welfare, make a less intensive use of environmental
resources, and control the emission of pollutants. The proposed approaches and
their solutions are novel applications for each case-study, compared to the
existing literature and practice. Furthermore, they provide useful insights for
most countries facing similar problems, they are easily applicable, and
developed and solved in publicly available tools such as Python.

which parts of the function can be inferred accurately and which cannot. For
example, it is generally understood that we can identify system parameters
accurately only close to detectors, or along ray paths between sources and
detectors, because we have ``the most information'' for these places.
  Although referenced in many publications, the ``information'' that is invoked
in such contexts is not a well understood and clearly defined quantity. Herein,
we present a definition of information density that is based on the variance of
coefficients as derived from a Bayesian reformulation of the inverse problem.
We then discuss three areas in which this information density can be useful in
practical algorithms for the solution of inverse problems, and illustrate the
usefulness in one of these areas -- how to choose the discretization mesh for
the function to be reconstructed -- using numerical experiments.

Containerization technologies are widely adopted in the DevOps
workflow. The most commonly used one is Docker, which requires developers to
define a specification file (Dockerfile) to build the image used for creating
containers. There are several best practice rules for writing Dockerfiles, but
the developers do not always follow them. Violations of such practices, known
as Dockerfile smells, can negatively impact the reliability and the performance
of Docker images. Previous studies showed that Dockerfile smells are widely
diffused, and there is a lack of automatic tools that support developers in
fixing them. However, it is still unclear what Dockerfile smells get fixed by
developers and to what extent developers would be willing to fix smells in the
first place.
  Objective. The aim of our exploratory study is twofold. First, we want to
understand what Dockerfiles smells receive more attention from developers,
i.e., are fixed more frequently in the history of open-source projects. Second,
we want to check if developers are willing to accept changes aimed at fixing
Dockerfile smells (e.g., generated by an automated tool), to understand if they
care about them.
  Method. In the first part of the study, we will evaluate the survivability of
Dockerfile smells on a state-of-the-art dataset composed of 9.4M unique
Dockerfiles. We rely on a state-of-the-art tool (hadolint) for detecting which
Dockerfile smells disappear during the evolution of Dockerfiles, and we will
manually analyze a large sample of such cases to understand if developers fixed
them and if they were aware of the smell. In the second part, we will detect
smelly Dockerfiles on a set of GitHub projects, and we will use a rule-based
tool to automatically fix them. Finally, we will open pull requests proposing
the modifications to developers, and we will quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate their outcome.

sector, is known to have a noninvertible gravitational anomaly that can be
compensated by the $Z_2$ toric model in 2d. In this paper, we study the
generalization of this type of bulk-boundary correspondence in a large class of
qubit lattice models in arbitrary dimensions, called the generalized Ising (GI)
models. We provide a systematic construction of exactly solvable bulk models,
where the GI models can terminate on their boundaries. In each bulk model, any
ground state is robust against local perturbations. If the model has degenerate
ground states with periodic boundary condition, the phase is topological and/or
fracton ordered. The construction generates abundant examples, including not
only prototype ones such as $Z_2$ toric code models in any dimensions no less
than two, and the X-cube fracton model, but also more diverse ones such as the
$Z_2\times Z_2$ topological order, the 4d $Z_2$ topological order with
pure-loop excitations, etc. The boundary of the solvable model is potentially
anomalous and corresponds to precisely only sectors of the GI model that host
certain total symmetry charges and/or satisfy certain boundary conditions. We
derive a concrete condition for such bulk-boundary correspondence. The
condition is violated only when the bulk model is either trivial or fracton
ordered. A generalized notion of Kramers-Wannier duality plays an important
role in the construction. Also, utilizing the duality, we find an example where
a single anomalous theory can be realized on the boundaries of two distinct
bulk fracton models, a phenomenon not expected in the case of topological
orders. More generally, topological orders may also be generated starting with
qubit lattice models beyond the GI models, such as those with SPT orders,
through a variant bulk construction, which we provide in an appendix.

important practical topic. Constrained optimization algorithms are widely
utilized and lead to many successes. Yet, such purely data-driven methods may
bring about incorrect physics in the presence of random noise and cannot easily
handle the situation with incomplete data. In this paper, a new iterative
learning algorithm for complex turbulent systems with partial observations is
developed that alternates between identifying model structures, recovering
unobserved variables, and estimating parameters. First, a causality-based
learning approach is utilized for the sparse identification of model
structures, which takes into account certain physics knowledge that is
pre-learned from data. It has unique advantages in coping with indirect
coupling between features and is robust to the stochastic noise. A practical
algorithm is designed to facilitate the causal inference for high-dimensional
systems. Next, a systematic nonlinear stochastic parameterization is built to
characterize the time evolution of the unobserved variables. Closed analytic
formula via an efficient nonlinear data assimilation is exploited to sample the
trajectories of the unobserved variables, which are then treated as synthetic
observations to advance a rapid parameter estimation. Furthermore, the
localization of the state variable dependence and the physics constraints are
incorporated into the learning procedure, which mitigate the curse of
dimensionality and prevent the finite time blow-up issue. Numerical experiments
show that the new algorithm succeeds in identifying the model structure and
providing suitable stochastic parameterizations for many complex nonlinear
systems with chaotic dynamics, spatiotemporal multiscale structures,
intermittency, and extreme events.

considering collected experiences equally in formulating a policy. This differs
from human decision-making, where gains and losses are valued differently and
outlying outcomes are given increased consideration. It also fails to
capitalize on opportunities to improve safety and/or performance through the
incorporation of distributional context. Several approaches to distributional
DRL have been investigated, with one popular strategy being to evaluate the
projected distribution of returns for possible actions. We propose a more
direct approach whereby risk-sensitive objectives, specified in terms of the
cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the distribution of full-episode
rewards, are optimized. This approach allows for outcomes to be weighed based
on relative quality, can be used for both continuous and discrete action
spaces, and may naturally be applied in both constrained and unconstrained
settings. We show how to compute an asymptotically consistent estimate of the
policy gradient for a broad class of risk-sensitive objectives via sampling,
subsequently incorporating variance reduction and regularization measures to
facilitate effective on-policy learning. We then demonstrate that the use of
moderately ""pessimistic"" risk profiles, which emphasize scenarios where the
agent performs poorly, leads to enhanced exploration and a continual focus on
addressing deficiencies. We test the approach using different risk profiles in
six OpenAI Safety Gym environments, comparing to state of the art on-policy
methods. Without cost constraints, we find that pessimistic risk profiles can
be used to reduce cost while improving total reward accumulation. With cost
constraints, they are seen to provide higher positive rewards than risk-neutral
approaches at the prescribed allowable cost.

in recent years and witnessed their rapid growth. Shared dockless e-scooters
have the potential to benefit neighborhoods that lack access to station-based
bikeshare services, but they may also exacerbate the existing spatial
disparities. While some studies have examined the equity of station-based
bikeshare systems, limited knowledge is available regarding dockless e-scooter
services. This study uses Washington DC as a case study, a city with both
dockless e-scooter and station-based bikeshare systems, to conduct equity
analysis of the two types of micromobility options. We develop an analytical
framework to examine how dockless e-scooter and station-based bikeshare differ
on a set of equity-related outcomes (i.e., availability, accessibility, usage,
and idle time) across neighborhoods of different socioeconomic categories.
Results reveal that dockless e-scooter services increase accessibility to
shared micromobility options for disadvantaged neighborhoods but also widen the
access gap across neighborhoods. Compared to bikeshare, shared e-scooters have
a higher level of spatial accessibility overall due to greater supply; however,
the greater supply largely leads to longer average idle time of shared
e-scooters rather than a greater number of trips. Finally, it appears that the
bikeshare system's equity program effectively promotes low-income use but
e-scooters' equity programs do not. Our findings suggest that increasing
vehicle supply alone would probably not lead to higher micromobility use in
disadvantaged neighborhoods. Instead, policymakers should combine a variety of
strategies such as promoting the enrollment of equity programs and reducing
access barriers (e.g., smartphone and banking requirements) to micromobility
services.

(CAPT), automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) plays a pivotal role in aiding
self-directed language learners by providing multi-aspect and timely feedback.
However, there are at least two potential obstacles that might hinder its
performance for practical use. On one hand, most of the studies focus
exclusively on leveraging segmental (phonetic)-level features such as goodness
of pronunciation (GOP); this, however, may cause a discrepancy of feature
granularity when performing suprasegmental (prosodic)-level pronunciation
assessment. On the other hand, automatic pronunciation assessments still suffer
from the lack of large-scale labeled speech data of non-native speakers, which
inevitably limits the performance of pronunciation assessment. In this paper,
we tackle these problems by integrating multiple prosodic and phonological
features to provide a multi-view, multi-granularity, and multi-aspect (3M)
pronunciation modeling. Specifically, we augment GOP with prosodic and
self-supervised learning (SSL) features, and meanwhile develop a
vowel/consonant positional embedding for a more phonology-aware automatic
pronunciation assessment. A series of experiments conducted on the
publicly-available speechocean762 dataset show that our approach can obtain
significant improvements on several assessment granularities in comparison with
previous work, especially on the assessment of speaking fluency and speech
prosody.

promising results. However, there are two major issues in existing LDL methods.
First, the expectations of label distributions are biased, leading to a biased
pose estimation. Second, fixed distribution parameters are applied for all
learning samples, severely limiting the model capability. In this paper, we
propose an Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian (ASG)-based LDL approach for facial
pose estimation. In particular, our approach adopts the spherical Gaussian
distribution on a unit sphere which constantly generates unbiased expectation.
Meanwhile, we introduce a new loss function that allows the network to learn

long-haul photonic-implementation of QKD protocols. However, the endeavour is
challenging in many aspects. In particular, one of the major challenges is the
polarization degree of freedom of single-photons getting affected while
transmission through optical fibres, or atmospheric turbulence. Conventionally,
an active feedback-based mechanism is employed to achieve real-time
polarization tracking. In this work, we propose an alternative approach where
we first perform a state tomography to reconstruct the output density matrix.
We then evaluate the optimal measurement bases at Bob's end that leads to the
maximum (anti-)correlation in the measurement outcomes of both parties. As a
proof-of-principle demonstration, we implement an in-lab BBM92 protocol -- a

$\approx 35$ Kbps. The protocol performance is independent of local
polarization rotations through optical fibres. We also develop an algorithmic
approach to optimize the trade-off between the key rate and QBER. Our approach
obviates the need for active polarization tracking. Our method is also
applicable to entanglement-based QKD demonstrations using partially mixed as
well as non-maximally entangled states, and extends to single-photon
implementations over fibre channels.

we observe that tail users suffer from significantly lower-quality
recommendation than the head users after joint training. We further identify
that a model trained on tail users separately still achieve inferior results

users still remains challenge in both research and industry. Directly applying
related methods on long-tail distribution might be at risk of hurting the

leads to a larger model size and hinders applicability to real-world problems
(e.g., large-scale KGs or mobile/edge computing). A lightweight modularized KGC
solution, called GreenKGC, is proposed in this work to address this issue.
GreenKGC consists of three modules: 1) representation learning, 2) feature
pruning, and 3) decision learning. In Module 1, we leverage existing KG
embedding models to learn high-dimensional representations for entities and
relations. In Module 2, the KG is partitioned into several relation groups
followed by a feature pruning process to find the most discriminant features
for each relation group. Finally, a classifier is assigned to each relation
group to cope with low-dimensional triple features for KGC tasks in Module 3.
We evaluate the performance of GreenKGC on four widely used link prediction
datasets and observe that GreenKGC can achieve comparable or even better
performance against original high-dimensional embeddings with a much smaller
model size. Furthermore, we experiment on two triple classification datasets to
demonstrate that the same methodology can generalize to more tasks.

secret keys) by exploiting information that leaks from the implementation (such
as power consumption), have been shown to be a non-negligible threat to modern
cryptographic implementations and devices in recent years. Hence, how to
prevent side-channel attacks on cryptographic devices has become an important
problem. One of the widely used countermeasures to against power SCAs is the
injection of random noise sequences into the raw leakage traces. However, the
indiscriminate injection of random noise can lead to significant increases in
energy consumption in device, and ways must be found to reduce the amount of
energy in noise generation while keeping the side-channel invisible. In this
paper, we propose an optimal energy-efficient design for artificial noise
generation to prevent side-channel attacks. This approach exploits the sparsity
among the leakage traces. We model the side-channel as a communication channel,
which allows us to use channel capacity to measure the mutual information
between the secret and the leakage traces. For a given energy budget in the
noise generation, we obtain the optimal design of the artificial noise
injection by solving the side-channel's channel capacity minimization problem.
The experimental results also validate the effectiveness of our proposed

address this issue, we propose a vector quantized diffusion method for

leverage the spatial-temporal information, we introduce a novel architecture,

sequential k-nearest-neighbours method to predict the variable lengths of pose
sequences for corresponding gloss sequences. Consequently, compared with the
autoregressive G2P models, our model has a faster sampling speed and produces
significantly better results. Compared with previous non-autoregressive G2P

path, a periodic nonlinear frequency-sweep optical signal with a time-varying
chirp rate is generated, which is then modulated at a Mach-Zehnder modulator
(MZM) by the electrical signal under test (SUT). The optical signal from the
MZM is selectively amplified by the SBS gain and converted back to the
electrical domain using a low-speed photodetector, implementing the periodic
SBS-based frequency-to-time mapping (FTTM). The frequency-domain information
corresponding to different periods is mapped to the time domain via the FTTM in
the form of low-speed electrical pulses, which is then spliced to analyze the
time-frequency relationship of the SUT in real-time. The time-varying chirp

representations; however, they do not explicitly the relationship between
latent representations. In many real-world applications, there may be causal
relationships between latent representations. Furthermore, most fair
representation learning methods focus on group-level fairness and are based on
correlations, ignoring the causal relationships underlying the data. In this
work, we theoretically demonstrate that using the structured representations
enable downstream predictive models to achieve counterfactual fairness, and
then we propose the Counterfactual Fairness Variational AutoEncoder (CF-VAE) to
obtain structured representations with respect to domain knowledge. The
experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better fairness and
accuracy performance than the benchmark fairness methods.

to capture the interconnectedness and volatility transmission dynamics. The
nature of change in volatility spillover effects and time-varying conditional
correlation among the G7 countries and India is investigated. Methodology: To
assess the volatility spillover effects, the bivariate BEKK and t- DCC (1,1)
GARCH (1,1) models have been used. Our research shows how the dynamics of
volatility spillover between India and the G7 countries shift before and during
COVID-19. Findings: The findings reveal that the extent of volatility spillover
has altered during COVID compared to the pre-COVID environment. During this
pandemic, a sharp increase in conditional correlation indicates an increase in
systematic risk between countries. Originality: The study contributes to a
better understanding of the dynamics of volatility spillover between G7
countries and India. Asset managers and foreign corporations can use the
changing spillover dynamics to improve investment decisions and implement
effective hedging measures to protect their interests. Furthermore, this
research will assist financial regulators in assessing market risk in the
future owing to crises like as COVID-19.

recognition, which poses unique challenges in learning transferable
representation from base classes to novel classes, particularly for
fine-grained actions. Existing meta-learning frameworks typically rely on the
body-level representations in spatial dimension, which limits the
generalisation to capture subtle visual differences in the fine-grained label
space. To overcome the above limitation, we propose a part-aware prototypical
representation for one-shot skeleton-based action recognition. Our method
captures skeleton motion patterns at two distinctive spatial levels, one for
global contexts among all body joints, referred to as body level, and the other
attends to local spatial regions of body parts, referred to as the part level.
We also devise a class-agnostic attention mechanism to highlight important
parts for each action class. Specifically, we develop a part-aware prototypical
graph network consisting of three modules: a cascaded embedding module for our
dual-level modelling, an attention-based part fusion module to fuse parts and
generate part-aware prototypes, and a matching module to perform classification
with the part-aware representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on two public skeleton-based action recognition datasets: NTU RGB+D 120

powerful tool that can effectively serve various inference tasks on graph

training system faces a scalability challenge. Distributed training is a
popular approach to address this challenge by scaling out CPU nodes. However,
not much attention has been paid to disk-based GNN training, which can scale up
the single-node system in a more cost-effective manner by leveraging
high-performance storage devices like NVMe SSDs. We observe that the data
movement between the main memory and the disk is the primary bottleneck in the
SSD-based training system, and that the conventional GNN training pipeline is
sub-optimal without taking this overhead into account. Thus, we propose Ginex,
the first SSD-based GNN training system that can process billion-scale graph
datasets on a single machine. Inspired by the inspector-executor execution
model in compiler optimization, Ginex restructures the GNN training pipeline by
separating sample and gather stages. This separation enables Ginex to realize a
provably optimal replacement algorithm, known as Belady's algorithm, for
caching feature vectors in memory, which account for the dominant portion of
I/O accesses. According to our evaluation with four billion-scale graph
datasets, Ginex achieves 2.11x higher training throughput on average (up to

insulators can be featured by the polarization which is believed identical to
the Wannier center. In this Letter, we show that second-order topological
insulators are present in the full process of topological phase transition
between a pair of degenerate photonic bands resulting from the non-symmorphic
glide symmetry in all-dielectric photonic crystals. Due to the coupling
(hybridization) of the Wannier functions, the center of the maximally localized
Wannier function always locates at the origin, not equal to the addition of
constituent polarization. In this case, the corner states are ascribed to the
hybridized Wannier functions obstructed by the boundary. In combination with
the local density of states, the second-order topology is clearly confirmed and
characterized. That ensures corner states which are fundamentally different to
either the type-I corner state localized in particular sublattice, or the
type-II corner state originated from interacting topological edge states. This
type of corner states is regarded as type-III here and provides an alternative
method to explore higher-order topological physics, which may lead to
interesting applications in integrated and quantum photonics.

astronomy. Stellar inner structures and their evolutionary states can be
precisely tested by asteroseismology, since the inner information is brought to
the stellar surface by the global oscillating waves and becomes observable. For
stellar evolutionary speed (i.e. how long time scale does a star stay at a
special evolution phase?), because of the insurmountable gap between the time
scales of the evolutionary history of human civilization and a star, it can
only be roughly tested by ensemble of stars in different evolutionary stages in
most cases, and all the snapshots of these stars make up our global view of
stellar evolution. The effect of stellar evolution on the structure and the
corresponding global size of a pulsating star will lead to tiny period
variations of its pulsation modes, which are the most valuable indicators of
its evolutionary state and can be used to test the stellar evolution theory by
a single star rather than ensemble of stars. Here, we report a High-Amplitude
$\delta$ Scuti star AE Ursae Majoris, who locates in the post main-sequence
(MS) evolutionary stage and its observed linear period variation rate can be
practically ascribed to its evolutionary effect. The result tests the stellar
evolution theory from the pre-MS to post-MS with an unprecedented precision by
a single star, and the framework can be extended to other type of pulsating
stars to perform precise evolutionary asteroseismology, which aims to test the
current stellar evolution theory in different evolutionary stages, discover the
discrepancies between the theory and observations, and ultimately build a
complete and precise stellar evolution theory to backtrack the history of each
of these stars.

single sample $Y_i$ from each distribution $\mathcal{D}_i$. After observing
each number, we have to make an irrevocable decision about whether we would
like to accept it or not with the goal of maximizing the probability of
selecting the largest number.
  The random order version of this problem was first studied by Correa et al.
[SODA 2020] who managed to construct an algorithm that achieves a probability
of $0.4529$. In this paper, we improve this probability to $0.5009$, almost
matching an upper bound of $\simeq 0.5024$ which we show follows from earlier
work. We also show that there is an algorithm which achieves the probability of
$\simeq 0.5024$ asymptotically if no particular distribution is especially
likely to yield the largest number. For the adversarial order version of the
problem, we show that we can select the maximum number with a probability of
$1/4$, and that this is best possible. Our work demonstrates that unlike in the
case of the expected value objective studied by Rubinstein et al. [ITCS 2020],
knowledge of a single sample is not enough to recover the factor of success

small amount of already aligned vertices -- called a seed. Current
state-of-the-art scalable seeded alignment algorithms are based on percolation.
Namely, aligned vertices are used to align their neighbors and gradually
percolate in parallel in both graphs. However, percolation-based graph
alignment algorithms are still limited in scale-free degree distributions. We
here propose `IRMA' -- Iterative Repair for graph MAtching to show that the
accuracy of percolation-based algorithms can be improved in real-world graphs
with a limited additional computational cost, and with lower run time when used
in a parallel version. IRMA starts by creating a primary alignment using an
existing percolation algorithm, then it iteratively repairs the mistakes in the
previous alignment steps. We prove that IRMA improves on single-iteration
algorithms. We then numerically show that it is significantly better than all
state-of-the-art seeded graph alignment algorithms on the graphs that they
tested. In scale-free networks, many vertices have a very low degree. Such
vertices have a high probability of erroneous alignments. We show that
combining iterations with high recall but low precision in the alignment leads
in the long run to higher recall and precision for the entire alignment.

the growth conditions as evaluated from saturation magnetization and x-ray
reflection profiles. The saturation magnetization at 5 K decreased linearly
from 6 uB per formula unit by 50% as the AS fraction increased from 0

(dis)order and the still debated doping mechanisms, has been engaging theorists
with different backgrounds. Regardless of the common interest across the
various communities active in this field, these efforts have not led so far to
a truly interdisciplinary research area. In the attempt to move further in this
direction, we present our perspective as solid-state theorists for the study of
molecular materials in different states of matter. Considering exemplary
systems belonging to well-known families of oligo-acenes and -thiophenes, we
provide a quantitative description of electronic properties and optical
excitations obtained with state-of-the-art first-principles methods such as
density-functional theory and many-body perturbation theory. Simulating the
systems as gas-phase molecules, clusters, and periodic lattices, we are able to
identify short- and long-range effects in their electronic structure. While the
latter are usually dominant in organic crystals, the former play an important
role, too, especially in the case of donor/acceptor complexes. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the viability of implicit schemes to evaluate band gaps of
molecules embedded in isotropic and even anisotropic environments, in
quantitative agreement with experiments. In the context of doped organic
semiconductors, we show how the crystalline packing enhances the favorable
characteristics of these systems for opto-electronic applications. The
counter-intuitive behavior predicted for their electronic and optical
properties is deciphered with the aid of a tight-binding model, which
represents a connection to the most common approaches to evaluate transport
properties in these materials.

options is limited to pumped-hydro storage and Li-Ion batteries. It is
uncertain which storage design will be able to compete with these options.
Considering Europe as a case study, we derive the cost and efficiency
requirements of a generic storage technology, which we refer to as storage-X,
to be deployed in the cost-optimal system. This is performed while including
existing pumped-hydro facilities and accounting for the competition from
stationary Li-ion batteries, flexible generation technology, and flexible
demand in a highly renewable sector-coupled energy system. Based on a sample
space of 724 storage configurations, we show that energy capacity cost and
discharge efficiency largely determine the optimal storage deployment, in
agreement with previous studies. Here, we show that charge capacity cost is
also important due to its impact on renewable curtailment. A significant
deployment of storage-X in a cost-optimal system requires (a) discharge
efficiency of at least 95%, (b) discharge efficiency of at least 50% together
with low energy capacity cost (10EUR/kWh), or (c) discharge efficiency of at
least 25% with very low energy capacity cost (2EUR/kWh). Comparing our findings

qualifying due to its low energy capacity cost and concurrent low charge

weakly textured surfaces or reflective objects. However, the depth accuracy is
limited due to the inherent ambiguity in monocular geometric modeling. In
contrast, multi-frame depth estimation methods improve the depth accuracy
thanks to the success of Multi-View Stereo (MVS), which directly makes use of
geometric constraints. Unfortunately, MVS often suffers from texture-less
regions, non-Lambertian surfaces, and moving objects, especially in real-world
video sequences without known camera motion and depth supervision. Therefore,
we propose MOVEDepth, which exploits the MOnocular cues and VElocity guidance
to improve multi-frame Depth learning. Unlike existing methods that enforce
consistency between MVS depth and monocular depth, MOVEDepth boosts multi-frame
depth learning by directly addressing the inherent problems of MVS. The key of
our approach is to utilize monocular depth as a geometric priority to construct
MVS cost volume, and adjust depth candidates of cost volume under the guidance
of predicted camera velocity. We further fuse monocular depth and MVS depth by
learning uncertainty in the cost volume, which results in a robust depth
estimation against ambiguity in multi-view geometry. Extensive experiments show
MOVEDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance: Compared with Monodepth2 and
PackNet, our method relatively improves the depth accuracy by 20\% and 19.8\%
on the KITTI benchmark. MOVEDepth also generalizes to the more challenging DDAD

Our approach makes use of classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to
calculate the temperature-dependent dynamical matrix, and the phononic heat
conductance is subsequently computed within the Landauer-B\""uttiker formalism
with the help of nonequilibrium Green's function techniques. Tailored to
nanostructures, crucial steps of force constant and heat transport calculations
are performed directly in real space. As compared to conventional density
functional theory (DFT) approaches, the advantage of our method is two-fold.
First, interatomic interactions can be described with the method of choice.
Semiempirical potentials may lead to large computational speedups, enabling the
study of much larger systems. Second, the method naturally takes into account
the temperature dependence of atomic force constants, an aspect that is ignored
in typical static DFT-based calculations. We illustrate our method by analyzing
the temperature dependence of the phononic thermal conductance of gold (Au)
chains with lengths ranging from 1 to 12 atoms. Moreover, in order to evaluate
the importance of anharmonic effects in these atomic-scale wires, we compare
the phase-coherent approach with nonequilibrium MD (NEMD) simulations. We find
that the predictions of the phase-coherent method and the classical NEMD
approach largely agree above the Debye temperature for all studied chain
lengths, which shows that heat transport is coherent and that our
phase-coherent approach is well suited for such nanostructures.

numerous applications in practice. For example, online gaming platforms often
host friendship-enhancing events in which a user (called the source) only
invites his/her friend (called the target) to play together. In this scenario,
the measure of friendship closeness is the backbone for understanding source
invitation and target adoption behaviors, and underpins the recommendation of
promising targets for the sources. However, most existing measures for
friendship closeness only consider the information between the source and
target but ignore the information of groups where they are located, which
renders inferior results. To address this issue, we present new measures for
friendship closeness based on the social identity theory (SIT), which describes
the inclination that a target endorses behaviors of users inside the same
group. The core of SIT is the process that a target assesses groups of users as
them or us. Unfortunately, this process is difficult to be captured due to
perceptual factors. To this end, we seamlessly reify the factors of SIT into
quantitative measures, which consider local and global information of a
target's group. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness
of our proposal against 8 state-of-the-art methods on 3 online gaming datasets.
In particular, we demonstrate that our solution can outperform the best
competitor on the behavior prediction (resp. online target recommendation) by
up to 23.2% (resp. 34.2%) in the corresponding evaluation metric.

demonstrate how knowledge from discrete dislocation dynamics simulations to
continuum-based formulations can be transferred by applying a physically based

a slip system dependent rate formulation of network evolution. We analyze
different discrete dislocation dynamics simulation data sets of face-centred
cubic single-crystals in high symmetric and non-high symmetric orientations
under uniaxial tensile loading. Here, we focus on the reaction evolution during
stage II plastic deformation. Our physically based model for network evolution
depends on the plastic shear rate and the dislocation travel distance described
by the dislocation density. We reveal a dependence of the reaction kinetics on
the crystal orientation and the activity of the interacting slip systems, which
can be described by the Schmid factor. It has been found, that the generation
of new reaction density is mainly driven by active slip systems. However, the
deposition of generated reaction density is not necessarily dependent on the
slip system activity of the considered slip system, i.e. we observe a
deposition of reaction density on inactive slip systems especially for glissile

human languages by machines. NLU models rely heavily on large training data to

few data resources and domain experts. It is necessary to overcome the data
scarcity challenge, when very few or even zero training samples are available.
In this thesis, we focus on developing cross-lingual and cross-domain methods
to tackle the low-resource issues. First, we propose to improve the model's
cross-lingual ability by focusing on the task-related keywords, enhancing the
model's robustness and regularizing the representations. We find that the
representations for low-resource languages can be easily and greatly improved
by focusing on just the keywords. Second, we present Order-Reduced Modeling
methods for the cross-lingual adaptation, and find that modeling partial word
orders instead of the whole sequence can improve the robustness of the model
against word order differences between languages and task knowledge transfer to
low-resource languages. Third, we propose to leverage different levels of
domain-related corpora and additional masking of data in the pre-training for
the cross-domain adaptation, and discover that more challenging pre-training
can better address the domain discrepancy issue in the task knowledge transfer.
Finally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework, Coach, and a cross-lingual

representation learning process into a coarse-grained and a fine-grained
feature learning, and X2Parser simplifies the hierarchical task structures into
flattened ones. We observe that simplifying task structures makes the
representation learning more effective for low-resource languages and domains.

reconstruct several maps of the large-scale surface magnetic field. Results. We
confirm that the polarimetric signal is modulated according to a $\sim 0.68$ d

decade. The available data suggest that smaller-scale magnetic spots may not be
limited to the polar region, although the poor reliability of their

The autoencoder architecture has satisfying performance in various image
segmentation tasks. However, autoencoders based on convolutional neural
networks (CNN) seem to encounter a bottleneck in improving the accuracy of
semantic segmentation. Increasing the inter-class distance between foreground
and background is an inherent characteristic of the segmentation network.
However, segmentation networks pay too much attention to the main visual
difference between foreground and background, and ignores the detailed edge
information, which leads to a reduction in the accuracy of edge segmentation.
In this paper, we propose a light-weight end-to-end segmentation framework
based on multi-task learning, termed Edge Attention autoencoder Network
(EAA-Net), to improve edge segmentation ability. Our approach not only utilizes
the segmentation network to obtain inter-class features, but also applies the
reconstruction network to extract intra-class features among the foregrounds.
We further design a intra-class and inter-class features fusion module -- I2
fusion module. The I2 fusion module is used to merge intra-class and
inter-class features, and use a soft attention mechanism to remove invalid
background information. Experimental results show that our method performs well
in medical image segmentation tasks. EAA-Net is easy to implement and has small

order to identify and characterize more OHPNe, we processed the unpublished
continuum data of the interferometric follow-up of the Southern Parkes
Large-Area Survey in Hydroxyl (SPLASH). We then matched the interferometric
positions of OH maser and radio continuum emission, considering the latter as a
possible tracer of free-free emission from photoionized gas, characteristic of
PNe. We report 8 objects with a positive coincidence, 4 of which are classified

that they are evolved stars, while the comparison with confirmed OHPNe
indicates that they are likely to be PNe. Their final confirmation as bona fide
PNe, however, requires optical/infrared spectroscopy. The obtained spectral
indices of the radio continuum emission (between $\simeq$ 0.4 - 1.3) are

uncertainty of quantum programs. Testing is, therefore, an indispensable method
for assuring the quality of quantum software. Existing testing methods focus
only on testing quantum programs with quantum circuits or single subroutines
and, therefore, cannot effectively test quantum programs with
multi-subroutines. In this paper, we first discuss several critical issues that
must be considered when testing multi-subroutine quantum programs and point out
the limitations and problems with existing testing methods. We then present a
novel framework for testing multi-subroutine quantum programs that allow for
both unit and integration testing. Our framework includes two novel test
coverage criteria for the equivalent class partition of quantum variables to
guide our testing tasks and techniques to test quantum programs with several
common patterns. We also discuss how to generate test cases based on our
framework. To evaluate the effectiveness of our testing framework, we
implemented a tool called QSharpTester for testing Q\# programs with multiple
subroutines. We used it to conduct experiments on hundreds of mutation programs
deriving from seven original Q\# programs. The experimental results show that
our testing methods can deal with broader types of quantum programs than
existing ones and perform well on almost all faulty mutation programs.

three pion-nucleon ($\pi N$) reactions, which can be subjected to experimental
investigation at low energy (pion laboratory kinetic energy $T \leq 100$ MeV),
i.e., of the two elastic-scattering (ES) processes $\pi^\pm p \to \pi^\pm p$
and of the $\pi^- p$ charge-exchange (CX) reaction $\pi^- p \to \pi^0 n$. After
the application of the four steps of the first phase of the new analysis
procedure, $52$ entries - of the $1150$ degrees of freedom of the new initial
database (DB) of this project - were identified as outliers and were removed
from the input. In this manner, three `clean' (devoid of outliers) DBs were
obtained, which were submitted to further analysis using the ETH model. The
phase-shift analysis (PSA) of the ES measurements comprises the results of one
hundred joint fits to the data, each fit being carried out at one value
(randomly generated, in normal distribution, according to a recent result) of
the model parameter $m_\sigma$, which is associated with the effective range of
the scalar-isoscalar part of the $\pi N$ interaction. The result of the PSA of
the ES data for the (square of the) charged-pion coupling constant $f_c$ is:
$f_c^2=0.0764(15)$. An exclusive fit of the ETH model to the low-energy $\pi^-
p$ CX DB was also performed, for the first time in the recent years, after
suppressing the contributions to the partial-wave amplitudes of the ETH model
which originate from the scalar-isoscalar $t$-channel Feynman diagram. The
predictions, obtained from these two types of fits (PSA of the ES data and
exclusive fit of the ETH model to the $\pi^- p$ CX DB) for the (popular)
symmetrised relative difference $R_2$ were compared in the entire low-energy
region, separately for the $s$ wave, as well as for the no-spin-flip and
spin-flip $p$-wave parts of the $\pi N$ scattering amplitude.

the Weyl-Stratonovich transform to the von Neumann equation for the density
matrix. The transform reduces to the Weyl transform in the electrostatic limit,
when the vector potential and thus the magnetic field are zero. Both cases
involve a center-of-mass transform followed by a Fourier integral on the
relative coordinate introducing the momentum variable. The latter is continuous
if the limits of the integral are infinite or, equivalently, the coherence
length is infinite. However, the quantum theory involves Fourier transforms of
the electromagnetic field components, which imposes conditions on their
behavior at infinity. Conversely, quantum systems are bounded and often very
small, as is, for instance, the case in modern nanoelectronics. This implies a
finite coherence length, which avoids the need to regularize non-converging
Fourier integrals. Accordingly, the momentum space becomes discrete, giving
rise to momentum quantization and to a semi-discrete gauge-invariant Wigner
equation. To gain insights into the peculiarities of this theory one needs to
analyze the equation for specific electromagnetic conditions. We derive the
evolution equation for the linear electromagnetic case and show that it
significantly simplifies for a limit dictated by the long coherence length
behavior, which involves momentum derivatives. In the discrete momentum picture
these derivatives are presented by finite difference quantities which, together
with further approximations, allow to develop a computationally feasible model
that offers physical insights into the involved quantum processes. In
particular, a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind is obtained, where
the ""power"" of the kernel components, measuring their rate of modification of
the quantum evolution, can be evaluated.

close to 10 nm in a Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/germanene vdW heterostructure. The origin of
these unique skyrmions is attributed to the high tunability of
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy by

heterostructures with buckled substrates. Based on our first-principles
parameters for the magnetic interactions, we calculate the energy barriers
protecting skyrmions against annihilation and their lifetimes using
transition-state theory. We show that nanoscale skyrmions in strained

multi-armed bandit setup with a central server and multiple clients. Each
client is associated with a multi-armed bandit in which each arm yields {\em
i.i.d.}\ rewards following a Gaussian distribution with an unknown mean and
known variance. The set of arms is assumed to be the same at all the clients.
We define two notions of best arm -- local and global. The local best arm at a
client is the arm with the largest mean among the arms local to the client,
whereas the global best arm is the arm with the largest average mean across all
the clients. We assume that each client can only observe the rewards from its
local arms and thereby estimate its local best arm. The clients communicate
with a central server on uplinks that entail a cost of $C\ge0$ units per usage
per uplink. The global best arm is estimated at the server. The goal is to
identify the local best arms and the global best arm with minimal total cost,
defined as the sum of the total number of arm selections at all the clients and
the total communication cost, subject to an upper bound on the error
probability. We propose a novel algorithm {\sc FedElim} that is based on
successive elimination and communicates only in exponential time steps and
obtain a high probability instance-dependent upper bound on its total cost. The
key takeaway from our paper is that for any $C\geq 0$ and error probabilities
sufficiently small, the total number of arm selections (resp.\ the total cost)
under {\sc FedElim} is at most~$2$ (resp.~$3$) times the maximum total number
of arm selections under its variant that communicates in every time step.
Additionally, we show that the latter is optimal in expectation up to a
constant factor, thereby demonstrating that communication is almost cost-free
in {\sc FedElim}. We numerically validate the efficacy of {\sc FedElim}.

is, however, a time-consuming and repetitive task if done manually. This is
true not only for clinical practice but also for the acquisition of training
data. We therefore not only present an end-to-end learnt algorithm that is
capable of segmenting 125 distinct bones in an upper-body CT, but also provide
an ensemble-based uncertainty measure that helps to single out scans to enlarge
the training dataset with. Methods We create fully automated end-to-end learnt
segmentations using a neural network architecture inspired by the 3D-Unet and
fully supervised training. The results are improved using ensembles and
inference-time augmentation. We examine the relationship of
ensemble-uncertainty to an unlabelled scan's prospective usefulness as part of
the training dataset. Results: Our methods are evaluated on an in-house dataset
of 16 upper-body CT scans with a resolution of \SI{2}{\milli\meter} per
dimension. Taking into account all 125 bones in our label set, our most
successful ensemble achieves a median dice score coefficient of 0.83. We find a
lack of correlation between a scan's ensemble uncertainty and its prospective
influence on the accuracies achieved within an enlarged training set. At the
same time, we show that the ensemble uncertainty correlates to the number of
voxels that need manual correction after an initial automated segmentation,
thus minimising the time required to finalise a new ground truth segmentation.
Conclusion: In combination, scans with low ensemble uncertainty need less
annotator time while yielding similar future DSC improvements. They are thus
ideal candidates to enlarge a training set for upper-body distinct bone
segmentation from CT scans. }

the go-to format for efficiency. However, low-bit floating point numbers have
an extra degree of freedom, assigning some bits to work on an exponential scale
instead. This paper in-depth investigates this benefit of the floating point
format for neural network inference. We detail the choices that can be made for
the FP8 format, including the important choice of the number of bits for the
mantissa and exponent, and show analytically in which settings these choices
give better performance. Then we show how these findings translate to real
networks, provide an efficient implementation for FP8 simulation, and a new
algorithm that enables the learning of both the scale parameters and the number
of exponent bits in the FP8 format. Our chief conclusion is that when doing
post-training quantization for a wide range of networks, the FP8 format is
better than INT8 in terms of accuracy, and the choice of the number of exponent
bits is driven by the severity of outliers in the network. We also conduct
experiments with quantization-aware training where the difference in formats
disappears as the network is trained to reduce the effect of outliers.

topological invariants in topological quantum computation and topological

incorporate not only particles but also loops -- spatially nonlocal objects --
making it novel and challenging to study topological invariants in higher
dimensions. While 2D fusion rules have been well understood from bulk
Chern-Simons field theory and edge conformal field theory, it is yet to be
thoroughly explored for 3D fusion rules from higher dimensional bulk
topological field theory. Here, we perform a field-theoretical study on (i) how
loops that carry Abelian gauge fluxes fuse and (ii) how loops are shrunk into
particles in the path integral, which generates fusion rules, loop-shrinking
rules, and descendent invariants, e.g., quantum dimensions. We first assign a
gauge-invariant Wilson operator to each excitation and determine the number of
distinct excitations through equivalence classes of Wilson operators. Then, we
adiabatically shift two Wilson operators together to observe how they fuse and
are split in the path integral; despite the Abelian nature of the gauge fluxes
carried by loops, their fusions may be of non-Abelian nature. Meanwhile, we
adiabatically deform world-sheets of unknotted loops into world-lines and
examine the shrinking outcomes; we find that the resulting loop-shrinking rules
are algebraically consistent to fusion rules. Interestingly, fusing a pair of
loop and anti-loop may generate multiple vacua, but fusing a pair of anyon and
anti-anyon in 2D has one vacuum only. By establishing a field-theoretical
ground for fusion and shrinking in 3D, this work leaves intriguing directions,
e.g., symmetry enrichment, quantum gates, and physics of braided monoidal

determination of the temperature. In this work, taking the well-known HD 163296
disk as an example, we investigated the contrast of gaps identified in high
angular resolution continuum images as a probe for the level of turbulence.
With self-consistent radiative transfer models, we simultaneously analyzed the
radial brightness profiles along the disk major and minor axes, and the
azimuthal brightness profiles of the B67 and B100 rings. By fitting all the gap
contrasts measured from these profiles, we constrained the gas-to-dust scale
height ratio $\Lambda$ to be $3.0_{-0.8}^{+0.3}$, $1.2_{-0.1}^{+0.1}$ and
${\ge}\,6.5$ for the D48, B67 and B100 regions, respectively. The varying
gas-to-dust scale height ratios indicate that the degree of dust settling
changes with radius. The inferred values for $\Lambda$ translate into a
turbulence level of $\alpha_{\rm turb}\,{<}\,3\times10^{-3}$ in the D48 and

observations. However, turbulent motions in the B67 ring are strong with
$\alpha_{\rm turb}\,{\sim}1.2\,{\times}\,10^{-2}$. Due to the degeneracy
between $\Lambda$ and the depth of dust surface density drops, the turbulence
strength in the D86 gap region is not constrained.

equivariance, i.e., that a shifted input causes an equally shifted output. In
practice, however, this is not always the case. This poses a great problem for
scene text detection for which a consistent spatial response is crucial,
irrespective of the position of the text in the scene.
  Using a simple synthetic experiment, we demonstrate the inherent shift
variance of a state-of-the-art fully convolutional text detector. Furthermore,
using the same experimental setting, we show how small architectural changes
can lead to an improved shift equivariance and less variation of the detector
output. We validate the synthetic results using a real-world training schedule
on the text detection network. To quantify the amount of shift variability, we
propose a metric based on well-established text detection benchmarks.
  While the proposed architectural changes are not able to fully recover shift
equivariance, adding smoothing filters can substantially improve shift
consistency on common text datasets. Considering the potentially large impact
of small shifts, we propose to extend the commonly used text detection metrics
by the metric described in this work, in order to be able to quantify the

hardware trojans (HTs) during manufacturing. Understanding the practicability
of such an attack can lead to appropriate measures for mitigating it. In this
paper, we demonstrate a pragmatic framework for analyzing HT susceptibility of
finalized layouts. Our framework is representative of a fabrication-time
attack, where the adversary is assumed to have access only to a layout
representation of the circuit. The framework inserts trojans into tapeout-ready
layouts utilizing an Engineering Change Order (ECO) flow. The attacked security
nodes are blindly searched utilizing reverse-engineering techniques. For our
experimental investigation, we utilized three crypto-cores (AES-128, SHA-256,
and RSA) and a microcontroller (RISC-V) as targets. We explored 96 combinations
of triggers, payloads and targets for our framework. Our findings demonstrate
that even in high-density designs, the covert insertion of sophisticated
trojans is possible. All this while maintaining the original target logic, with
minimal impact on power and performance. Furthermore, from our exploration, we
conclude that it is too naive to only utilize placement resources as a metric
for HT vulnerability. This work highlights that the HT insertion success is a
complex function of the placement, routing resources, the position of the
attacked nodes, and further design-specific characteristics. As a result, our
framework goes beyond just an attack, we present the most advanced analysis
tool to assess the vulnerability of HT insertion into finalized layouts.

\textit{assemblages} of unnormalised quantum states, have recently caught the
attention of the community, both from a foundational and an
information-theoretic perspective. The set of quantum-realisable assemblages,
or abbreviated to quantum assemblages, are those that arise from multiple
parties performing local measurements on a shared quantum system. In general,
deciding whether or not a given assemblage is a quantum assemblage, i.e.
membership of the set of quantum assemblages, is a hard problem, and not always
solvable. In this paper we introduce a hierarchy of tests where each level
either determines non-membership of the set of quantum assemblages or is
inconclusive. The higher the level of the hierarchy the better one can
determine non-membership, and this hierarchy converges to a particular set of
assemblages. Furthermore, this set to which it converges contains the quantum
assemblages. Each test in the hierarchy is formulated as a semidefinite
program. This hierarchy allows one to upper bound the quantum violation of a
steering inequality and the quantum advantage provided by quantum EPR
assemblages in a communication or information-processing task.

light-matter interactions in sub-wavelength nanostructures with broken
symmetries. In noncentrosymmetric photonic crystals, the SOC results in the
splitting of the otherwise degenerate energy bands. Herein, we explore the SOC
in a noncentrosymmetric plasmonic crystal, both theoretically and
experimentally. Cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy combined with the
numerically calculated photonic band structure reveals an energy band splitting
that is ascribed to the broken symmetries in the noncentrosymmetric plasmonic
crystal. By shifting the impact position of the electron beam throughout a unit
cell of the plasmonic crystal, we show that the emergence of the energy band
splitting strongly depends on the excitation position of the surface plasmon
(SP) waves on the crystal. Moreover, we exploit angle-resolved CL and
dark-field polarimetry to demonstrate polarization-dependent scattering of SP
waves interacting with the plasmonic crystal. The scattering direction of a
given polarization is determined by the transverse spin angular momentum
inherently carried by the SP wave, which is in turn locked to the direction of
SP propagation. Our study gives insight into the design of novel plasmonic
devices with polarization-dependent directionality of the Bloch plasmons. We
expect spin-orbit plasmonics will find much more scientific interests and
potential applications with the continuous development of nanofabrication
methodologies and uncovering new aspects of spin-orbit interactions.

shocks, which are expected to have magnetic field much stronger than the
interstellar field, although the origin of the field is a long-standing
problem. Two field amplification mechanisms, plasma kinetic instabilities and
magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, have been discussed so far. The coherence
length scales of the fields amplified by these two processes are different by
$7-10$ orders of magnitudes, and the polarimetric observations may distinguish
them. We construct a semi-analytic model of the forward shock afterglow
polarization under the assumption of hydrodynamic-scale turbulent magnetic
field. We perform numerical calculations of synchrotron polarization for the
isotropic turbulence and the zero viewing angle. We find that the polarization
degrees are $ \sim1~\%$ when the field coherence length scale in the fluid
comoving frame is of the order of the thickness of the shocked regions. This
range of polarization degree is comparable to that of the observed late-phase
optical afterglows. Our model also shows that the radio polarization degrees
are comparable to the optical ones on average but can be higher than the
optical ones at some time intervals. The polarization angles are shown to vary
randomly and continuously. These polarimetric properties are clearly different
from the case of plasma kinetic instability. Simultaneous polarimetric
observations of GRB afterglows at the radio and optical bands have recently

video transmission, also called DeepJSCC, has been a topic of interest recently
with very promising results. The idea is to map similar source samples to
nearby points in the channel input space such that, despite the noise
introduced by the channel, the input can be recovered with minimal distortion.
In DeepJSCC, this is achieved by an autoencoder architecture with a
non-trainable channel layer between the encoder and decoder. DeepJSCC has many
favorable properties, such as better end-to-end distortion performance than its
separate source and channel coding counterpart as well as graceful degradation
with respect to channel quality. However, due to the inherent correlation
between the source sample and channel input, DeepJSCC is vulnerable to
eavesdropping attacks. In this paper, we propose the first DeepJSCC scheme for
wireless image transmission that is secure against eavesdroppers, called
DeepJSCEC. DeepJSCEC not only preserves the favorable properties of DeepJSCC,
it also provides security against chosen-plaintext attacks from the
eavesdropper, without the need to make assumptions about the eavesdropper's
channel condition, or its intended use of the intercepted signal. Numerical
results show that DeepJSCEC achieves similar or better image quality than
separate source coding using BPG compression, AES encryption, and LDPC codes
for channel coding, while preserving the graceful degradation of image quality
with respect to channel quality. We also show that the proposed encryption
method is problem agnostic, meaning it can be applied to other end-to-end JSCC
problems, such as remote classification, without modification. Given the
importance of security in modern wireless communication systems, we believe
this work brings DeepJSCC schemes much closer to adoption in practice.

obtained from an arm increases with the number of pulls it receives. This model
provides an elegant abstraction for many real-world problems in domains such as
education and employment, where decisions about the distribution of
opportunities can affect the future capabilities of communities and the
disparity between them. A decision-maker in such settings must consider the
impact of her decisions on future rewards in addition to the standard objective
of maximizing her cumulative reward at any time. In many of these applications,
the time horizon is unknown to the decision-maker beforehand, which motivates
the study of the IMAB problem in the technically more challenging
horizon-unaware setting. We study the tension that arises between two seemingly
conflicting objectives in the horizon-unaware setting: a) maximizing the
cumulative reward at any time based on current rewards of the arms, and b)
ensuring that arms with better long-term rewards get sufficient opportunities
even if they initially have low rewards. We show that, surprisingly, the two
objectives are aligned with each other in this setting. Our main contribution
is an anytime algorithm for the IMAB problem that achieves the best possible
cumulative reward while ensuring that the arms reach their true potential given
sufficient time. Our algorithm mitigates the initial disparity due to lack of
opportunity and continues pulling an arm till it stops improving. We prove the
optimality of our algorithm by showing that a) any algorithm for the IMAB
problem, no matter how utilitarian, must suffer $\Omega(T)$ policy regret and

use of coded blocks or shards that allows participants to store only a fraction
of the total blockchain, protect against malicious nodes or erasures due to
nodes leaving a blockchain system, ensure data availability in order to promote
transparency, and scale the security of sharded blockchains. Further, it helps
reduce communication cost when disseminating blocks, which is critical to
bootstrapping new nodes and helps speed up consensus of blocks. For each

alterations in synoptic circulations. Here, the automated Jenkinson-Collison
(JC) classification is used to assess the ability of twenty-one Global Climate
Models (GCMs) to capture the frequency of recurring circulation types (CTs) and
their implications for European daily precipitation intensities in summer
(JJA). The ability of the GCMs to reproduce the observed present-day climate
features is first evaluated. Most GCMs capture the observed links between mean
directional flow characteristics of the CTs, and the occurrence of dry days and
related dry months. The most robust relationships are found for anticyclonic
and easterly CTs which are generally associated with higher than average
occurrences of dry conditions. Future changes in summer frequencies of the CTs
are estimated in the high-emissions SSP5-8.5 scenario for the sake of a high
signal-to-noise ratio. Our results reveal consistent changes, mainly in the
zonal CTs. A robust decrease in frequency of the westerlies and increase in the
frequency of easterly CTs favour more continental, dry and warm air masses over
Central Europe. These dynamical changes are shown to enhance the projected
summer drying over central and southern Europe.

such a pipelined framework limits the optimization of the final retrieval
quality, because indexing and retrieving are separated stages that can not be
jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner. In order to unify these two stages,
we explore a model-based indexer for document retrieval. Concretely, we propose
Ultron, which encodes the knowledge of all documents into the model and aims to
directly retrieve relevant documents end-to-end. For the model-based indexer,
how to represent docids and how to train the model are two main issues to be
explored. Existing solutions suffer from semantically deficient docids and
limited supervised data. To tackle these two problems, first, we devise two
types of docids that are richer in semantics and easier for model inference. In
addition, we propose a three-stage training workflow to capture more knowledge
contained in the corpus and associations between queries and docids.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of Ultron over
advanced baselines for document retrieval.

programs that checks for safety violations by exploring all possible thread
schedulings. It is highly effective when coupled with Dynamic Partial Order
Reduction (DPOR), which introduces an equivalence on schedulings and need
explore only one in each equivalence class. Even with DPOR, SMC often spends
unnecessary effort in exploring loop iterations that are pure, i.e., have no
effect on the program state. We present techniques for making SMC with DPOR
more effective on programs with pure loop iterations. The first is a static
program analysis to detect loop purity and an associated program
transformation, called Partial Loop Purity Elimination, that inserts assume
statements to block pure loop iterations. Subsequently, some of these assumes
are turned into await statements that completely remove many assume-blocked
executions. Finally, we present an extension of the standard DPOR equivalence,
obtained by weakening the conflict relation between events. All these
techniques are incorporated into a new DPOR algorithm, Optimal-DPOR-Await,
which can handle both awaits and the weaker conflict relation, is optimal in
the sense that it explores exactly one execution in each equivalence class, and
can also diagnose livelocks. Our implementation in Nidhugg shows that these
techniques can significantly speed up the analysis of concurrent programs that
are currently challenging for SMC tools, both for exploring their complete set
of interleavings, but even for detecting concurrency errors in them.

that the recommendations of the robot operating inside the store did have a

computationally and theoretically investigated. The prominent computational
finding is that the flicker frequency nonlinearly increases with the rotational
intensity number R (up to 0.24), which measures the relative importance of the
rotational speed compared with the methane jet speed. This finding is
consistent with the previous experimental observations that flame flicker is
enhanced by rotatory flows within a certain extent. Based on the
vortex-dynamical understanding of flickering flames that the flame flicker is
caused by the periodic shedding of buoyancy-induced toroidal vortices, we
formulated a scaling theory for flickering buoyant diffusion flames in weakly
rotatory flows. The theory predicts that, with respect to the flicker frequency
f_0 at R=0, the increase of the flicker frequency f at nonzero R obeys the
scaling relation f-f_0~R^2, which agrees very well with the present
computational results. In physics, the externally rotatory flow enhances the
radial pressure gradient around the flame, and the significant baroclinic
effect contributes an additional source for the growth of toroidal vortices so
that their periodic shedding is faster.

motion. One of the main issues on the path towards efficient domain wall based
devices remains the characterization of the pinning landscape at the nanoscale.
In this paper, we study domain wall motion in W/CoFeB/MgO thin films with
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy crystallized by annealing at 400$^{\circ}$C
and a process based on He$^{+}$ irradiation combined with elevated
temperatures. Magnetic properties are similar for the whole series of samples,
while the magnetic domain wall mobility is critically improved in the
irradiated samples. By using an analytical model to extract nanoscale pinning
parameters, we reveal important variations in the disorder of the crystallized
samples. This work offers a unique opportunity to selectively analyze the
effects of disorder on the domain wall dynamics, without the contribution of
changes in the magnetic properties. Our results highlight the importance of
evaluating the nanoscale pinning parameters of the material when designing
devices based on domain wall motion, which in return can be a powerful tool to
probe the disorder in ultra-thin magnetic films.

Moreover, since CSKBs operate under the open-world assumption, absent
statements are considered to have unknown truth rather than being invalid. This
paper presents the UNCOMMONSENSE framework for materializing informative
negative commonsense statements. Given a target concept, comparable concepts
are identified in the CSKB, for which a local closed-world assumption is
postulated. This way, positive statements about comparable concepts that are
absent for the target concept become seeds for negative statement candidates.
The large set of candidates is then scrutinized, pruned and ranked by
informativeness. Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations show that our method
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art. A large dataset of informative

reported for a small number (about 7) of AGNs and has been firmly established
only for 5 of them. The time delay is probably increasing with the IR
wavelengths. The most naturally this time delay can be interpreted by the model
where IR emission is attributed to circumnuclear dust heated by the nuclear
radiation. In given model a suggestion on narrowness of the near-infrared (NIR)
emission region is quite natural, as far as the dust can be not saved on
distances from the nucleus closer then some critical value, on which it is
reached the sublimation temperature for graphite particles (Barvainis, 1987).
For NGC 4151 case it has been shown that the NIR region has a form of thin ring
or torus. The radius of this ring correlates with level of the nucleus activity
(Oknyanskij et al. 1999). This dependency of radius of the NIR emission region
from luminosity reveals itself as under object variability (as in the case of
NGC4151), and also when objects with high and low luminosity are considered. We
assume that the observed time delays allow us to derive a redshift independent
luminosity distances to AGNs and estimate a Hubble constant.
  Some problems of using this strategy for the Hubble constant determination
are discussed.

radii $R_0$. The droplets are placed on top of a rigid substrate with a contact
angle of $\theta_{eq.} = \pi/9$. Having a highly wettable substrate
($\theta_{eq} \ll \pi/2$) theory predicts that the bridge height ($h_0$) scales
according to $h_0(t) \sim t^{2/3}.$ This behavior can be altered with e.g.
surface tension gradients ($\partial_x\gamma \neq 0$). These gradients appear
for example with heat transfer, surfactants or having different but miscible
liquids. Instead of coalescence, these gradients can lead to a stable two
droplet state. In this work, we focus on two aspects of this problem. The first
one is the concrete choice of the surface tension, therefore making it
spatially correlated. The second one is the reduction of scale towards a regime
in which the disjoining pressure becomes important. We find that coalescence
can be suppressed, given that there is a sharp gradient in surface tension. If
this gradient is smeared, we find an intermediate agreement with the $2/3$
power-law. In the limit of large smearing width, we observe an asymmetric
coalescence.

congested skies overhead cities, analogously to what happened with other
transportation means, including commercial aviation. In the latter case, the
combination of large distances and demanded number flights is such that a
system with centralized control, with most of the decisions made by human
operators, is safe. However, for AAM, it is expected a much higher demand,
because it will be used for people's daily commutes. Thus, higher automation
levels will become a requirement for coordinating this traffic, which might not
be effectively managed by humans. The establishment of fixed air routes can
abate complexity, however at the cost of limiting capacity and decreasing
efficiency. Another alternative is the use of a powerful central system based
on Artificial Intelligence (AI), which would allow flexible trajectories and
higher efficiency. However, such system would require concentrated investment,
could contain Single-Points-of-Failure (SPoFs), would be a highly sought target
of malicious attacks, and would be subject to periods of unavailability.
  This work proposes a new technology that solves the problem of managing the
high complexity of the AAM traffic with a secure distributed approach, without
the need for a proprietary centralized automation system. This technology
enables distributed airspace allocation management and conflict resolution by
means of trusted shared data structures and associated smart contracts running
on a blockchain ecosystem. This way, it greatly reduces the risk of system
outages due to SPoFs, by allowing peer-to-peer conflict resolution, and being
more resilient to failures in the ground communication infrastructure.
Furthermore, it provides priority-based balancing mechanisms that help to
regulate fairness among participants in the utilization of the airspace.

thereby creating a possibility of states with high GME while in the unbiased
case, average GME is optimized over all possible outcomes. Interestingly, we
show that the set of two-qubit unsharp measurements can generate multipartite

geometric measure, the monogamy-based entanglement measure, tangle and
robustness against particle loss quantified via persistency depending on the
rank of the unsharp measurement operators. Specifically, in the process of
producing three-qubit pure states, we prove that rank-$2$ measurements can
create only Greenberger Horne Zeilinger (GHZ)-class states while only W-class
states are produced with rank-$4$ measurements although rank-$3$ measurements
are capable to generate both. In the case of multipartite states with an
arbitrary number of qubits, we report that the average content of genuine

astrophysical signals. This paper presents a vertical inertial sensor which
senses the relative motion between an inertial test mass suspended by a blade
spring and a seismically isolated platform. An interferometric readout was used
which introduces low sensing noise, and preserves a large dynamic range due to
fringe-counting. The expected sensitivity is comparable to other
state-of-the-art interferometric inertial sensors and reaches values of
$10^{-10}\,\text{m}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at 100 mHz and
$10^{-12}\,\text{m}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at 1 Hz. The potential sensitivity
improvement compared to commercial L-4C geophones is shown to be about two
orders of magnitude at 10 mHz and 100 mHz and one order of magnitude at 1 Hz.
The noise performance is expected to be limited by thermal noise of the

inequality to give a lower bound on uncalculated distances. Two exclusion
mechanisms derive from this property, generally known as pivot exclusion and
hyperplane exclusion. These mechanisms work in any proper metric space and are
the basis of many metric indexing mechanisms. More recently, the Ptolemaic and
four-point lower bound properties have been shown to give tighter bounds in
some subclasses of metric space.
  Both triangle inequality and the four-point lower bound directly imply
straightforward partitioning mechanisms: that is, a method of dividing a finite
space according to a fixed partition, in order that one or more classes of the
partition can be eliminated from a search at query time. However, up to now, no
partitioning principle has been identified for the Ptolemaic inequality, which
has been used only as a filtering mechanism.
  Here, a novel partitioning mechanism for the Ptolemaic lower bound is
presented. It is always better than either pivot or hyperplane partitioning.
While the exclusion condition itself is weaker than Hilbert (four-point)
exclusion, its calculation is cheaper. Furthermore, it can be combined with
Hilbert exclusion to give a new maximum for exclusion power with respect to the
number of distances measured per query.

and chemical properties of protoplanetary disks, and in particular on the
formation and destruction of carbon-based molecules. With the thermo-chemical
code ProoDIMO we investigate the impact of lower metallicities on the radiation
field, disk temperature, and the abundance of different molecules (H$_2$O,
CH$_4$, CO, CO$_2$, HCN, CN, HCO$^+$ and N$_2$H$^+$). We use a fiducial disk
model as a reference model and produce two models with lower metallicity. The
resulting influence on different chemical species is studied by analyzing their
abundance distribution throughout the disk and their vertical column density.
Furthermore, the formation and destruction reactions of the chemical species
are studied. The results show a relation between the metallicity of the disk
and the strength of the stellar radiation field inside the disk. As the
metallicity decreases the radiation field is able to penetrate deeper regions
of the disk. As a result, there is a stronger radiation field overall in the
disk with lower metallicity which also heats up the disk. This triggers a
series of changes in the chemical formation and destruction efficiencies for
different chemical species. In most cases, the available species abundances
change and have greater values compared to scaled-down abundances by constant
factors. Metallicity has a clear impact on the snowline of the molecules
studied here as well. As metallicity decreases the snowlines are pushed further
out and existing snow rings shrink in size.

that they may latch onto spurious correlations (""shortcuts"", e.g., focusing

analyze the confounders existing in this task. Then, we introduce an
instrumental variable to eliminate the confounding causal effects, thus
extracting the pure causal effect between sentence and sentiment. We compare
the proposed ISAIV model with several strong baselines on both the general
implicit sentiment analysis and aspect-based implicit sentiment analysis tasks.
The results indicate the great advantages of our model and the efficacy of

of the catalogues' completeness or selection function: objects of what
properties had a chance to end up in the catalogue. Here we set out to
empirically quantify the completeness of the overall Gaia DR3 catalogue. This
task is not straightforward because Gaia is the all-sky optical survey with the
highest angular resolution to date and no consistent ``ground truth'' exists to
allow direct comparisons.
  However, well-characterised deeper imaging enables an empirical assessment of
Gaia's $G$-band completeness across parts of the sky.
  On this basis, we devised a simple analytical completeness model of Gaia as a
function of the observed $G$ magnitude and position over the sky, which
accounts for both the effects of crowding and the complex Gaia scanning law.
Our model only depends on a single quantity: the median magnitude $M_{10}$ in a
patch of the sky of catalogued sources with
$\texttt{astrometric_matched_transits}$ $\leq 10$. $M_{10}$ reflects elementary
completeness decisions in the Gaia pipeline and is computable from the Gaia DR3
catalogue itself and therefore applicable across the whole sky. We calibrate
our model using the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS) and test its
predictions against Hubble Space Telescope observations of globular clusters.
We find that our model predicts Gaia's completeness values to a few per cent
across the sky. We make the model available as a part of the $\texttt{gaiasf}$

new trigger is a uniformly randomly generated three-dimensional (3D) binary

superposed onto three-channel images for training a backdoored DNN model.
Dispersed throughout an image, the new trigger produces weak perturbation to
individual pixels, but collectively holds a strong recognizable pattern to
train and activate the backdoor of the DNN. We also analytically reveal that
the trigger is increasingly effective with the improving resolution of the
images. Experiments are conducted using the ResNet-18 and MLP models on the

all present setups adopted essentially a gigantic, resource-inefficient

driving forces for developing medical image segmentation models. Existing
toolkits mainly focus on fully supervised segmentation and require full and
accurate pixel-level annotations that are time-consuming and difficult to
acquire for segmentation tasks, which makes learning from imperfect labels
highly desired for reducing the annotation cost. We aim to develop a new deep
learning toolkit to support annotation-efficient learning for medical image
segmentation.
  Methods: Our proposed toolkit named PyMIC is a modular deep learning library
for medical image segmentation tasks. In addition to basic components that
support development of high-performance models for fully supervised
segmentation, it contains several advanced components tailored for learning
from imperfect annotations, such as loading annotated and unannounced images,
loss functions for unannotated, partially or inaccurately annotated images, and
training procedures for co-learning between multiple networks, etc. PyMIC
supports development of semi-supervised, weakly supervised and noise-robust
learning methods for medical image segmentation.
  Results: We present several illustrative medical image segmentation tasks
based on PyMIC: (1) Achieving competitive performance on fully supervised
learning; (2) Semi-supervised cardiac structure segmentation with only 10%
training images annotated; (3) Weakly supervised segmentation using scribble
annotations; and (4) Learning from noisy labels for chest radiograph
segmentation.
  Conclusions: The PyMIC toolkit is easy to use and facilitates efficient
development of medical image segmentation models with imperfect annotations. It
is modular and flexible, which enables researchers to develop high-performance
models with low annotation cost. The source code is available at:

the strings $S$, and another $O(M \log (T/ \bar e)+S)$ method that becomes
progressively more efficient as a function of the fraction of equal elements

robots using a node graph of landmarks that are based on fiducial markers. The
use of ArUco markers and their 2D orientation with respect to the camera of the

relative position of the robot as well as the relative positions of other
markers. The proposed method combines aspects of beacon-based navigation and
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping based navigation. The implementation of
this method uses a depth camera to obtain the distance to the marker. After
calculating the required orientation of the marker, it relies on odometry
calculations for tracking the position after localization with respect to the
marker. Using the odometry and the relative position of one marker, the robot
is then localized with respect to another marker. The relative positions and
orientation of the two markers are then calculated. The markers are represented
as nodes and the relative distances and orientations are represented as edges
connecting the nodes and a node graph can be generated that represents a map
for the robot. The method was tested on a wheeled humanoid robot with the
objective of having it autonomously navigate to a charging station inside a
room. This objective was successfully achieved and the limitations and future
improvements are briefly discussed.

spectrum of the red giant became more prominent as the flux declined, and by
day 46.3 dominated the spectrum. Hydrogen and helium emission lines consisted
of a narrow component superposed on a broad pedestal. The full width at half
maximum of the narrow components declined with time $t$ as the eruption
progressed, as ${t}^{-0.74}$, whereas those of the broad components remained
essentially constant. Conversely, the line fluxes of the narrow components of
Pa,$\beta$ remained roughly constant, while those of the broad components
declined by a factor $\sim30$ over a period of $\lesssim25$~days. The behaviour
of the broad components is consistent with them arising in unencumbered
fast-flowing ejecta perpendicular to the binary plane, in material that was
ejected in a short $\sim3.3$-day burst. The narrow components arise in material
that encounters the accumulated circumstellar material. The outburst spectra
were rich in coronal lines. There were two coronal line phases, one that
originated in gas ionised by supersoft X-ray source, the other in shocked gas.
From the relative fluxes of silicon and sulphur coronal lines on day 23.4 -
when the emitting gas was shocked - we deduce that the temperature of the
coronal gas was $9.3\times10^5$~K, and that the abundances are approximately
solar.

characteristic measurements show that the transport carriers in the nanosheet

strongly disordered regime. Magnetotransport measurements for the device at
magnetic fields applied perpendicular to the nanosheet plane show dominantly
weak antilocalization (WAL) characteristics at low fields and a linear

characteristics to strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI) and the LMR to the

effective 2D conduction channel number and coefficient in the linear term due

generic fourth-order theory of gravity, where $X:=R$ is Ricci scalar,
$Y:=R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$ is Ricci square, and
$Z:=R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$ is Riemann square. A new type of
gauge condition is proposed so that the linearized gravitational field
equations of $F(X,Y,Z)$ gravity are greatly simplified, and then, the
stationary metric in the region exterior to the source is derived. In the
process of applying the result, integrations are performed only over the domain
occupied by the source. The multipole expansion of the metric potential in
$F(X,Y,Z)$ gravity for a spatially compact stationary source is also presented.
In the expansion, the corrections of $F(X,Y,Z)$ gravity to General Relativity
are Yukawa-like ones, dependent on two characteristic lengths. Two additional
sets of mass-type source multipole moments appear in the corrections and the
salient feature characterizing them is that the integrations in their

coarse discretizations, however, this requires closure models to account for

filter the continuous equations, but this gives rise to several commutator
errors due to nonlinear terms, non-uniform filters, or boundary conditions.
  We propose a new approach to filtering, where the equations are discretized
first and then filtered. For a non-uniform filter applied to the linear
convection equation, we show that the discretely filtered convection operator
can be inferred using three methods: intrusive (`explicit reconstruction') or
non-intrusive operator inference, either via `derivative fitting' or
`trajectory fitting' (embedded learning). We show that explicit reconstruction
and derivative fitting identify a similar operator and produce small errors,
but that trajectory fitting requires significant effort to train to achieve
similar performance. However, the explicit reconstruction approach is more

evolving with temperature. In an applied magnetic field applied parallel to the
$b$-axis, the intensity of the $(\delta,0,1)$ satellite peaks decreases
continuously up to about $\mu_0 H \simeq 5$ T, above which field the system
becomes field polarised. Both the eccentricity of the cycloid and the
wavevector increase with field, the latter suggesting an enhancement of the
anti$-$symmetric Dzyaloshinskii$-$Moriya interaction via magnetostriction
effects. Transitions between the various low-temperature magnetic phases have
been carefully mapped out using magnetometry and resistivity. The resulting
phase diagram reveals that the cycloid phase exists in a temperature window
that expands rapidly with increasing field, before transitioning to a polarised
paramagnetic state at 5 T. High-field magnetoresistance measurements show that
below $T\simeq 70$ K the resistivity increases continuously with decreasing
temperature, indicating the inherent insulating nature at low temperatures of
our high-quality, untwinned, single-crystals. We discuss our results with
reference to previous reports of the magnetic phase diagram of
Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ that utilised samples which were more metallic and/or

a clear window into the phase-space structure of clusters without the use of

exclude departures from General Relativity of order unity. We conclude the

mechanics. The counterpart of this question in quantum mechanics can be
regarded as what the possible range of the expectation values of the position
operator $ \langle x \rangle$ of a particle, which satisfies $E= \langle H
\rangle$. This range depends on the state of the particle, but the universal
upper and lower bounds, which is independent of the state, must exist. In this
study, we show that these bounds can be derived by using the bootstrap method.
We also point out that the bootstrap method can be regarded as a generalization
of the uncertainty relations, and it means that the bounds are determined by
the uncertainty relations in a broad sense. Furthermore, the bounds on possible
expectation values of various quantities other than position can be determined
in the same way. However, in the case of multiple identical particles (bosons
and fermions), we find some difficulty in the bootstrap method. Because of this
issue, the predictive power of the bootstrap method in multi-particle systems
is limited in the derivation of observables including energy eigenstates. In
addition, we argue an application of the bootstrap method to thermal
equilibrium states. We find serious issues that temperature and entropy cannot
be handled. Although we have these issues, we can derive some quantities in
micro-canonical ensembles of integrable systems governed by generalized Gibbs

Unfortunately, high device error-rates pose a significant challenge in using
these near-term quantum systems to power real-world applications. Executing a
program on existing quantum systems generates both correct and incorrect
outcomes, but often, the output distribution is too noisy to distinguish
between them. In this paper, we show that erroneous outcomes are not arbitrary
but exhibit a well-defined structure when represented in the Hamming space. Our
experiments on IBM and Google quantum computers show that the most frequent
erroneous outcomes are more likely to be close in the Hamming space to the
correct outcome. We exploit this behavior to improve the ability to infer the
correct outcome.
  We propose Hamming Reconstruction (HAMMER), a post-processing technique that
leverages the observation of Hamming behavior to reconstruct the noisy output
distribution, such that the resulting distribution has higher fidelity. We
evaluate HAMMER using experimental data from Google and IBM quantum computers
with more than 500 unique quantum circuits and obtain an average improvement of
1.37x in the quality of solution. On Google's publicly available QAOA datasets,

characteristic length reaches the nanometer scale, due to heat dissipation. In
this work, we developed a tip-enhanced Raman thermometry approach to study
ballistic thermal transport within the range of 10 nm in GaN, simultaneously
achieving laser heating and measuring the local temperature. The Raman results
showed that the temperature increase from an Au-coated tip-focused hotspot was
up to two times higher (40 K) than that in a bare tip-focused region (20 K). To
further investigate the possible mechanisms behind this temperature difference,
we performed electromagnetic simulations to generate a highly focused heating
field, and observed a highly localized optical penetration, within a range of
10 nm. The phonon mean free path (MFP) of the GaN substrate could thus be
determined by comparing the numerical simulation results with the
experimentally measured temperature increase which was in good agreement with
the average MFP weighted by the mode-specific thermal conductivity, as
calculated from first-principles simulations. Our results demonstrate that the
phonon MFP of a material can be rapidly predicted through a combination of

parallaxes, proper motions, and colours, respectively, using the VOSA tool to
estimate the effective temperatures. For the ML methodology, we built a
two-step method based on principal component analysis and support vector
machine algorithms. We identified a total of 7827 new candidate UCDs, which
represents an increase of about 135% in the number of UCDs reported in the sky
coverage of the J-PLUS second data release. Among the candidate UCDs, we found
122 possible unresolved binary systems, 78 wide multiple systems, and 48
objects with a high Bayesian probability of belonging to a young association.
We also identified four objects with strong excess in the filter corresponding
to the Ca II H and K emission lines and four other objects with excess emission
in the H$\alpha$ filter. With the ML approach, we obtained a recall score of
92% and 91% in the test and blind test, respectively. We consolidated the
proposed search methodology for UCDs, which will be used in deeper and larger
upcoming surveys such as J-PAS and Euclid. We concluded that the ML methodology
is more efficient in the sense that it allows for a larger number of true

unbiased estimation of an observable encounters an exponential growth with the
circuit depth in the lower bound on the measurement cost. Under the global
depolarizing noise, we in particular find that the bound can be asymptotically
saturated by merely rescaling the measurement results. Moreover, we prove for
random circuits with local noise that the cost grows exponentially also with
the qubit count. Our numerical simulations support the observation that, even
if the circuit has only linear connectivity, such as the brick-wall structure,
each noise channel converges to the global depolarizing channel with its
strength growing exponentially with the qubit count. This not only implies the
exponential growth of cost both with the depth and qubit count, but also
validates the rescaling technique for sufficiently deep quantum circuits. Our
results contribute to the understanding of the physical limitations of quantum
error mitigation and offer a new criterion for evaluating the performance of
quantum error mitigation techniques.

(spreading channels). We provide an example that is physically relevant: the
estimation of the absolute value of the displacement in the presence of phase
randomizing noise. Surprisingly, this noise does not affect the effectiveness
of the optimal measurement. We show that, for small displacement, a squeezed
vacuum probe field is optimal among strategies with same average energy. A
squeezer followed by photodetection is the optimal detection strategy that
attains the quantum Fisher information, whereas the customarily used homodyne
detection becomes useless in the limit of small displacements, due to the same
effect that gives Rayleigh's curse in optical superresolution. There is a
quantum advantage: a squeezed or a Fock state with $N$ average photons allow to
asymptotically estimate the parameter with a $\sqrt{N}$ better precision than
classical states with same energy.

nanoscale hotspots attracts wide attentions and urges efficient thermal
management. Heat convection is one of the important heat dissipating paths but
its mechanism at nanoscale hotspots is still unclear. Here shows the first
experimental investigation of the convective heat transfer coefficient at
size-controllable nanoscale hotspots. A specially designed structure of a
single layer graphene supported by gold nanorods (AuNRs) is proposed, in which
the AuNRs generate plasmonic heating sources of the order of hundreds of
nanometers under laser irradiation and the graphene layer works as a
temperature probe in Raman thermometry. The determined convective heat transfer
coefficient is found to be about three orders of magnitude higher than that of
nature convection, when the simultaneous interfacial heat conduction and
radiation are carefully evaluated. Heat convection thus accounts to more than
half of the total energy transferred across the graphene/AuNRs interface. Both
the plasmonic heating induced nanoscale hotspots and ballistic convection of
gas molecules contribute to the enhanced heat convection. This work reveals the
importance of heat convection at nanoscale hotspots to the accurate thermal
design of miniaturized electronics, and further offers a new way to evaluate
the convective heat transfer coefficient at nanoscale hotspots.

deterministic degradations (e.g., blur, masking, and more), the training and

evolution of bubbles inflated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets, as well as
their interactions with the ambient intracluster medium (ICM). These jets
inflate lobes that turn into bubbles after the jets are turned off (at $t=50$
Myr). Almost all of the energy injected into the jets is transferred to the ICM
very quickly after they are turned off, with roughly $70$ per cent of it in
thermal form and the rest in kinetic. At late times ($t>500$ Myr) we find the
following: 1) the bubbles draw out trailing filaments of low-entropy gas,
similar to those recently observed, 2) the action of buoyancy and the uplift of
the filaments dominates the energetics of both the bubbles and the ICM and 3)
almost all of the originally injected energy is in the form of gravitational
potential energy, with the bubbles containing $15$ per cent of it, and the rest
contained in the ICM. These findings indicate that feedback proceeds mainly
through the displacement of gas to larger radii. We find that the uplift of
these filaments permanently changes the thermodynamic properties of the ICM by
reducing the central density and increasing the central temperature (within
$30$ kpc). We propose that jet feedback proceeds not only through the heating
of the ICM (which can delay cooling), but also through the uplift-related
reduction of the central gas density. The latter also delays cooling, on top of
reducing the amount of gas available to cool.

BEV -- a new BEV representation that does not require feature sampling. We
demonstrate that perspective BEV features can likewise enjoy the benefits of
the BEV paradigm. Moreover, the perspective BEV improves detection performance

high-performance object detection in perspective BEV space based on this

$D\bar{D}$ pairs, based on a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity
of 2.93\,fb$^{-1}$ collected at the $\psi(3770)$ resonance by the BESIII
experiment. The asymmetry between $C\!P$-odd and $C\!P$-even eigenstate decays
into $K^-\pi^+$ is determined to be ${\cal A}_{K\pi} = 0.132 \pm 0.011 \pm
0.007$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is
systematic. This measurement is an update of an earlier study exploiting
additional tagging modes, including several decay modes involving a $K^0_L$
meson. The branching fractions of the $K^0_L$ modes are determined as input to
the analysis in a manner that is independent of any strong phase uncertainty.
Using the predominantly $C\!P$-even tag $D\to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ and the ensemble
of $C\!P$-odd eigenstate tags, the observable ${\cal A}_{K\pi}^{\pi\pi\pi^0}$
is measured to be $0.130 \pm 0.012 \pm 0.008$. The two asymmetries are
sensitive to $r_D^{K\pi} \cos \delta_D^{K\pi}$, where $r_D^{K\pi}$ and
$\delta_D^{K\pi}$ are the ratio of amplitudes and phase difference,
respectively, between the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed and Cabibbo-favoured
decays. In addition, events containing $D \to K^-\pi^+$ tagged by $D \to
K^0_{S,L} \pi^+\pi^-$ are studied in bins of phase space of the three-body
decays. This analysis has sensitivity to both $r_D^{K\pi} \cos \delta_D^{K\pi}$
and $r_D^{K\pi} \sin \delta_D^{K\pi}$. A fit to ${\cal A}_{K\pi}$, ${\cal
A}_{K\pi}^{\pi\pi\pi^0}$ and the phase-space distribution of the $D \to
K^0_{S,L} \pi^+\pi^-$ tags yields $\delta_D^{K\pi}= \left( 187.6
{^{+8.9}_{-9.7}}{^{+5.4}_{-6.4}} \right)$ degrees, where external constraints
are applied for $r_D^{K\pi}$ and other relevant parameters. This is the most
precise measurement of $\delta_D^{K\pi}$ in quantum-correlated $D\bar{D}$

Galactic Cepheids based on high-quality astrometry from the third data release
(DR3) of the ESA mission Gaia to improve the calibration of the Leavitt law
(LL). Our approach requires no prior knowledge of existing clusters, allowing
us to both detect new host clusters and cross-check previously reported
associations. Our Gold sample consists of 34 Cepheids residing in 28 open
clusters, including 27 fundamental mode and 7 overtone Cepheids. Three new bona
fide cluster Cepheids are reported (V0378 Cen, ST Tau, and GH Lup) and the host
cluster identifications for three others (VW Cru, IQ Nor, and SX Vel) are
corrected. The fraction of Cepheids occurring in open clusters within 2 kpc of
the Sun is $f_{CC,2kpc} = 0.088^{+0.029}_{-0.019}$. By combining cluster and
field Cepheids, we calibrate the LL for several individual photometric
passbands, together with reddening-free Wesenheit magnitudes based on Gaia and
HST photometry, while solving for the residual offset applicable to Cepheid
parallaxes, $\Delta \varpi_{\mathrm{Cep}}$. The most direct comparison of our
results with the SH0ES distance ladder yields excellent ($0.3\sigma$) agreement
for both the absolute magnitude of a 10d solar metallicity Cepheid in the
near-IR HST Wesenheit magnitudes, $M_{H,1}^W=-5.914\pm 0.017$ mag, and the
residual parallax offset, $\Delta \varpi_{\mathrm{Cep}}=-13 \pm 5\,\mu$as.
Using the larger sample of 26 Gold cluster Cepheids and $225$ MW Cepheids with
recent Gaia DR3 astrometry and photometry, we determine at solar metallicity
$M_{G,1}^W = -6.004 \pm 0.019$\,mag and $\Delta \varpi_{\mathrm{Cep}}=-19 \pm

long-lived, non-myopic agent, without knowing the agent's payoff function.
Although learning in Stackelberg games is well-understood when the agent is
myopic, non-myopic agents pose additional complications. In particular,
non-myopic agents may strategically select actions that are inferior in the
present to mislead the principal's learning algorithm and obtain better
outcomes in the future.
  We provide a general framework that reduces learning in presence of
non-myopic agents to robust bandit optimization in the presence of myopic
agents. Through the design and analysis of minimally reactive bandit
algorithms, our reduction trades off the statistical efficiency of the
principal's learning algorithm against its effectiveness in inducing
near-best-responses. We apply this framework to Stackelberg security games
(SSGs), pricing with unknown demand curve, strategic classification, and
general finite Stackelberg games. In each setting, we characterize the type and
impact of misspecifications present in near-best-responses and develop a
learning algorithm robust to such misspecifications.
  Along the way, we improve the query complexity of learning in SSGs with $n$
targets from the state-of-the-art $O(n^3)$ to a near-optimal $\widetilde{O}(n)$

based on stochastic image-autoregressive recurrent networks, which raises
various performance and application difficulties, such as computational cost
and limited efficiency on massive datasets. Another possibility is to use
entirely latent temporal models that combine frame synthesis and temporal

stochastic video prediction has yet been proposed in the literature. This paper
addresses these issues by introducing a novel stochastic temporal model whose

and adjacent fields. Modern methods for BID can be grouped into two categories:
single-instance methods that deal with individual instances using statistical
inference and numerical optimization, and data-driven methods that train
deep-learning models to deblur future instances directly. Data-driven methods
can be free from the difficulty in deriving accurate blur models, but are
fundamentally limited by the diversity and quality of the training data --
collecting sufficiently expressive and realistic training data is a standing
challenge. In this paper, we focus on single-instance methods that remain
competitive and indispensable. However, most such methods do not prescribe how
to deal with unknown kernel size and substantial noise, precluding practical
deployment. Indeed, we show that several state-of-the-art (SOTA)
single-instance methods are unstable when the kernel size is overspecified,
and/or the noise level is high. On the positive side, we propose a practical
BID method that is stable against both, the first of its kind. Our method
builds on the recent ideas of solving inverse problems by integrating the
physical models and structured deep neural networks, without extra training

development of new drugs to treat central nervous system disorders presents
unique challenges due to poor penetration efficacy across the blood-brain

biological systems and processes as well as the use case is given. (ii) Second,
an in-depth literature review of existing computational techniques for
detecting BBB permeability is undertaken. From there, an aspect unexplored
across current techniques is identified and a solution is proposed. (iii)
Lastly, a two-part in silico model to quantify likelihood of permeability of
drugs with defined features across the BBB through passive diffusion is
developed, tested, and reflected on. Testing and validation with the dataset
determined the predictive logBB model's mean squared error to be around 0.112

challenge in the structure-based drug design. Despite recent advance in
data-driven methods in affinity prediction, their accuracy is still limited,
partially because they only take advantage of static crystal structures while
the actual binding affinities are generally depicted by the thermodynamic
ensembles between proteins and ligands. One effective way to approximate such a
thermodynamic ensemble is to use molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Here, we
curated an MD dataset containing 3,218 different protein-ligand complexes, and
further developed Dynaformer, which is a graph-based deep learning model.
Dynaformer was able to accurately predict the binding affinities by learning
the geometric characteristics of the protein-ligand interactions from the MD
trajectories. In silico experiments demonstrated that our model exhibits
state-of-the-art scoring and ranking power on the CASF-2016 benchmark dataset,
outperforming the methods hitherto reported. Moreover, we performed a virtual
screening on the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) using Dynaformer that identified
20 candidates and further experimentally validated their binding affinities. We
demonstrated that our approach is more efficient, which can identify 12 hit
compounds (two were in the submicromolar range), including several newly
discovered scaffolds. We anticipate this new synergy between large-scale MD
datasets and deep learning models will provide a new route toward accelerating
the early drug discovery process.

control algorithm that can learn across the tasks when faced with a sequence of
$N$ (similar) control tasks. Each task involves controlling a linear dynamical
system for a finite horizon of $T$ time steps. The cost function and system
noise at each time step are adversarial and unknown to the controller before
taking the control action. Meta-learning is a broad approach where the goal is
to prescribe an online policy for any new unseen task exploiting the
information from other tasks and the similarity between the tasks. We propose a
meta-learning online control algorithm for the control setting and characterize
its performance by \textit{meta-regret}, the average cumulative regret across
the tasks. We show that when the number of tasks are sufficiently large, our
proposed approach achieves a meta-regret that is smaller by a factor $D/D^{*}$
compared to an independent-learning online control algorithm which does not
perform learning across the tasks, where $D$ is a problem constant and $D^{*}$
is a scalar that decreases with increase in the similarity between tasks. Thus,
when the sequence of tasks are similar the regret of the proposed meta-learning
online control is significantly lower than that of the naive approaches without
meta-learning. We also present experiment results to demonstrate the superior
performance achieved by our meta-learning algorithm.

task, the dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) task based on video

is often more challenging. One of the main reasons is that video sequences
often contain frames with different expression intensities, especially for the
facial expressions in the real-world scenarios, while the images in SFER
frequently present uniform and high expression intensities. However, if the
expressions with different intensities are treated equally, the features
learned by the networks will have large intra-class and small inter-class
differences, which is harmful to DFER. To tackle this problem, we propose the
global convolution-attention block (GCA) to rescale the channels of the feature
maps. In addition, we introduce the intensity-aware loss (IAL) in the training
process to help the network distinguish the samples with relatively low

captures image intensities using binary bits. Assuming that the analog voltage
generated at the floating diffusion of the photodiode follows a
Poisson-Gaussian distribution, the sensor produces either a ``1'' if the
voltage is above a certain threshold or ``0'' if it is below the threshold. The
concept of this binary sensor has been proposed for more than a decade, and
physical devices have been built to realize the concept. However, what benefits
does a one-bit QIS offer compared to a conventional multi-bit CMOS image
sensor? Besides the known empirical results, are there theoretical proofs to
support these findings?
  The goal of this paper is to provide new theoretical support from a signal
processing perspective. In particular, it is theoretically found that the
sensor can offer three benefits: (1) Low-light: One-bit QIS performs better at
low-light because it has a low read noise, and its one-bit quantization can
produce an error-free measurement. However, this requires the exposure time to
be appropriately configured. (2) Frame rate: One-bit sensors can operate at a
much higher speed because a response is generated as soon as a photon is
detected. However, in the presence of read noise, there exists an optimal frame
rate beyond which the performance will degrade. A Closed-form expression of the
optimal frame rate is derived. (3) Dynamic range: One-bit QIS offers a higher
dynamic range. The benefit is brought by two complementary characteristics of
the sensor: nonlinearity and exposure bracketing. The decoupling of the two
factors is theoretically proved, and closed-form expressions are derived.

non unity coefficients and generic initial values in their recursive

and the diagonalization of symmetric Toeplitz matrices having in total four
non-zero off diagonals. For the latter, the symmetric Tetranacci polynomials
are the basic entities of the associated eigenvectors; thus, treating the
recursive structure determines the eigenvalues as well. Subsequently, we
present a complete closed form expression for any symmetric Tetranacci

Fibonacci polynomials.

to navigate a complex labyrinth, the mice exhibit foraging behaviour in the
labyrinth searching for rewards, returning to their home cage now and then,
e.g. to drink. Surprisingly, when executing such a ``home run'', the mice do
not follow the exact reverse path, in fact, the entry path and home path have
very little overlap. Recent work proposed a hierarchical active inference model
for navigation, where the low level model makes inferences about hidden states
and poses that explain sensory inputs, whereas the high level model makes
inferences about moving between locations, effectively building a map of the
environment. However, using this ``map'' for planning, only allows the agent to
find trajectories that it previously explored, far from the observed mice's
behaviour. In this paper, we explore ways of incorporating before-unvisited
paths in the planning algorithm, by using the low level generative model to
imagine potential, yet undiscovered paths. We demonstrate a proof of concept in
a grid-world environment, showing how an agent can accurately predict a new,
shorter path in the map leading to its starting point, using a generative model
learnt from pixel-based observations.

A specific class of algorithms known as counterfactuals may be able to provide
causability. In statistics, causality has been studied and applied for many
years, but not in great detail in artificial intelligence (AI). In a
first-of-its-kind study, we employed the principles of causal inference to
provide explainability for solving the analytical customer relationship
management (ACRM) problems. In the context of banking and insurance, current
research on interpretability tries to address causality-related questions like
why did this model make such decisions, and was the model's choice influenced
by a particular factor? We propose a solution in the form of an intervention,
wherein the effect of changing the distribution of features of ACRM datasets is
studied on the target feature. Subsequently, a set of counterfactuals is also
obtained that may be furnished to any customer who demands an explanation of

affective states into discrete categories. However, the emotion may fluctuate
instead of maintaining a stable state even within a short time interval. There
is also a difficulty to take the full use of the EEG spatial distribution due
to its 3-D topology structure. To tackle the above issues, we proposed a
locally temporal-spatial pattern learning graph attention network (LTS-GAT) in
the present study. In the LTS-GAT, a divide-and-conquer scheme was used to
examine local information on temporal and spatial dimensions of EEG patterns
based on the graph attention mechanism. A dynamical domain discriminator was
added to improve the robustness against inter-individual variations of the EEG
statistics to learn robust EEG feature representations across different
participants. We evaluated the LTS-GAT on two public datasets for affective
computing studies under individual-dependent and independent paradigms. The
effectiveness of LTS-GAT model was demonstrated when compared to other existing
mainstream methods. Moreover, visualization methods were used to illustrate the
relations of different brain regions and emotion recognition. Meanwhile, the
weights of different time segments were also visualized to investigate emotion

artificial stochastic disturbances on a sustained turbulence. Using the
two-dimensional (2D) turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard (RB) convection as an example,
we numerically solve the NS equations, separately, by means of a traditional
algorithm with double precision (marked by RKwD) and the so-called clean
numerical simulation (CNS). The numerical simulation given by the RKwD is a
mixture of the ""true"" physical solution and the ""false"" numerical noises that
is random and can be regarded as a kind of artificial stochastic disturbances:
unfortunately, the ""true"" physical solution is mostly at the same level as the
""false"" numerical noises. By contrast, the CNS can greatly reduce the
background numerical noise to any a required level so that the ""false""
numerical noises are negligible compared with the ""true"" physical solution and
thus the CNS solution can be used as a ""clean"" benchmark solution for
comparison. It is found that the numerical noises as tiny artificial stochastic
disturbances could indeed lead to large-scale deviations of simulations not
only in spatio-temporal trajectories but also even in statistics. Especially,
these numerical noises (as artificial stochastic disturbances) even lead to
different types of flows: the shearing convection occurs for the RKwD
simulations, and its corresponding flow field turns to a kind of zonal flow
thereafter, however the CNS benchmark solution always sustains the non-shearing
vortical/roll-like convection during the whole process of simulation. Thus, we
provide a rigorous evidence that numerical noises as a kind of small-scale
artificial stochastic disturbances have quantitatively and qualitatively
large-scale influences on a sustained turbulence, i.e. the 2D turbulent RB
convection considered in this paper.

concentrated only on the interpretability of the model, whereas others have
focused on enhancing the performance. Models that consider both
interpretability and the performance improvement have been insufficient.
Moreover, models that focus on performance improvements have not shown an
overwhelming performance compared with existing models. In this study, we
propose MonaCoBERT, which achieves the best performance on most benchmark

architecture with monotonic convolutional multihead attention, which reflects
forgetting behavior of the students and increases the representation power of
the model. We can also increase the performance and interpretability using a
classical test-theory-based (CTT-based) embedding strategy that considers the
difficulty of the question. To determine why MonaCoBERT achieved the best
performance and interpret the results quantitatively, we conducted ablation
studies and additional analyses using Grad-CAM, UMAP, and various visualization
techniques. The analysis results demonstrate that both attention components
complement one another and that CTT-based embedding represents information on
both global and local difficulties. We also demonstrate that our model

nodal chains in non-symmorphic phononic systems, where the connecting rings lie
in the same plane. The constituting nodal rings are protected by mirror
symmetry, their intersection is guaranteed by the combination of time-reversal
and non-symmorphic two-fold screw symmetry. In addition, the connecting points
are four-fold degenerate while those in previous works are two-fold degenerate.
We searched all 230 space groups and found 8 space groups that can host the
proposed planar nodal chain phonons. Taking wurtzite GaN (space group No.186)
as an example, the planar nodal chain is confirmed by first-principles
calculations. The planar nodal chains result in two distinct classes of

scales as $v_{h\textrm{rms}}(a) = v_{h\textrm{rms}}(1)/a$, where $a$ is the
expansion parameter of the universe. This velocity dispersion results in a
cut-off of the power spectrum of density fluctuations due to dark matter
free-streaming. Let $k_\textrm{fs}(t_\textrm{eq})$ be the free-streaming
comoving cut-off wavenumber at the time of equal densities of radiation and
matter. We obtain $v_{h\textrm{rms}}(1) = 0.41^{+0.14}_{-0.12} \textrm{ km/s}$,
and $k_\textrm{fs}(t_\textrm{eq}) = 2.0^{+0.8}_{-0.5} \textrm{ Mpc}^{-1}$, at
68\% confidence, from the observed distributions of galaxy stellar masses and
rest frame ultra-violet luminosities. This result is consistent with
reionization. From the velocity dispersion cut-off we obtain the limits
$v_{h\textrm{rms}}(1) < 0.54 \textrm{ km/s}$, and $k_\textrm{fs}(t_\textrm{eq})
> 1.5 \textrm{ Mpc}^{-1}$. These results are in agreement with previous
measurements based on spiral galaxy rotation curves, and on the formation of
first galaxies and reionization. These measured parameters determine the
temperature-to-mass ratio of warm dark matter. This ratio happens to be in
agreement with the no freeze-in and no freeze-out warm dark matter scenario of
spin 0 dark matter particles decoupling early on from the standard model
sector. Spin 1/2 and spin 1 dark matter are disfavored if nature has chosen the
no freeze-in and no freeze-out scenario. An extension of the standard model of
quarks and leptons, with scalar dark matter that couples to the Higgs boson,
that is in agreement with all current measurements, is briefly reviewed.
Discrepancies with limits on dark matter particle mass that can be found in the

improving the throughput of the underlying wireless communication networks.
Network node deployment has been considered as an effective approach for
throughput enhancement which, however, often leads to highly non-trivial
non-convex optimizations. Although convex approximation based solutions are
considered in the literature, their approximation to the actual throughput may
be loose and sometimes lead to unsatisfactory performance. With this
consideration, in this paper, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN)
method for the network node deployment problem. Specifically, we fit a GNN to
the network throughput and use the gradients of this GNN to iteratively update
the locations of the network nodes. Besides, we show that an expressive GNN has
the capacity to approximate both the function value and the gradients of a
multivariate permutation-invariant function, as a theoretic support to the
proposed method. To further improve the throughput, we also study a hybrid node
deployment method based on this approach. To train the desired GNN, we adopt a
policy gradient algorithm to create datasets containing good training samples.
Numerical experiments show that the proposed methods produce competitive
results compared to the baselines.

representation of the extended Lorentz Group. Combined PMD-PDL effects are
shown to be formally identical to Lorentz Transformations acting on spin 1/2
zero mass particles. Since there are two different irreducible spinor
representations of the restricted Lorentz Group, there must also exist two
kinds of states of polarizations (SOPs) that are relevant in the description of
PMD-PDL effects. The optical process that allows to convert one kind into the
other is identified as optical phase conjugation. Optical phase conjugation
plays the same role as the time inversion operator in the Lorentz Group
representation theory. A practical and extremely important example of utility
of these ideas, a technique that significantly reduces the PMD-PDL induced
impairments, is presented. This technique allows to cancel the PDL part of the
