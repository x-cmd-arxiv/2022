light curve, which is caused by the resonant caustic. The event has a severe
degeneracy with $\Delta \chi^2 = 0.9$ between the close and the wide binary
lens models both with planet-host mass ratio $q \simeq 0.007$. We measure the
angular Einstein radius but not the microlens parallax, and thus we perform a
Bayesian analysis to estimate the physical parameters of the lens. We find that
the OGLE-2019-BLG-0362L system is a super-Jovian-mass planet $M_{\rm

  proceedings",,,,"cs.AR cs.ET physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  2.5D chiplet systems have been proposed to improve the low manufacturing
yield of large-scale chips. However, connecting the chiplets through an
electronic interposer imposes a high traffic load on the interposer network.
Silicon photonics technology has shown great promise towards handling a high
volume of traffic with low latency in intra-chip network-on-chip (NoC) fabrics.
Although recent advances in silicon photonic devices have extended photonic
NoCs to enable high bandwidth communication in 2.5D chiplet systems, such
interposer-based photonic networks still suffer from high power consumption. In
this work, we design and analyze a novel Reconfigurable power-efficient and
congestion-aware Silicon Photonic 2.5D Interposer network, called ReSiPI.
Considering run-time traffic, ReSiPI is able to dynamically deploy
inter-chiplet photonic gateways to improve the overall network congestion.
ReSiPI also employs switching elements based on phase change materials (PCMs)
to dynamically reconfigure and power-gate the photonic interposer network,
thereby improving the network power efficiency. Compared to the best prior
state-of-the-art 2.5D photonic network, ReSiPI demonstrates, on average, 37%
lower latency, 25% power reduction, and 53% energy minimization in the network.

known to have convergence issues at relatively larger flow rates. In this
study, we investigate the possibility of a numerically efficient GNF-based
approximation of FENE-P, which would closely approximate the flow field.
Firstly, we compare the flow fields predicted by FENE-P and an equivalent GNF
model. For these studies, we considered the flow around a sphere and selected
the Carreau-Yasuda model as the representative GNF. This is made equivalent to
the FENE-P by selecting parameters to equalize the viscosity-shear rate
dependence. Our results show severe deficiencies of the GNF model, owing to its
inability to account for chain stretching, particularly near the stagnation
points. Next, the effect of extensional components on the local viscosity was
added by formulating an equivalent GNF-X [Journal of Rheology 64, 493 (2020)]
model. Even this failed to capture the asymmetry in the stress and flow
profiles and predicted very large stresses at both stagnation points, relative
to FENE-P. Hence, we proposed a novel modified formalism (denoted as GNF-XM)
that was able to capture all trends successfully. The drag coefficients from
GNF-XM agreed well with FENE-P predictions for all flow rates considered.
Significantly, the computational times required to solve the flow field with
GNF-XM is about an order of magnitude lower than that of FENE-P, especially at
higher flow rates. Thus, we have successfully formulated a highly efficient
GNF-based approximation to the FENE-P, whose formalism can be extended to other
similarly complicated constitutive models.

Fe2Mo have been studied using the finite-temperature quantum mechanical
calculations within the frame of the density functional theory under the

was obtained using phonon calculations. The thermal expansion path of Fe2Mo was
predicted by comparing between free energies calculated in different

thermal expansion. The obtained result was compared with the path calculated in
previous theoretical work used the Debye-Gruneisen approach and accounted

nulling the low redshift structure with a model-insensitive procedure that is
similar to delensing. This results in a high-$z$-only mass map that can provide

to biases in neutrino mass constraints. In contrast, we show with forecasts

the target image from other similar images. To evaluate the distinctiveness of
captions, we introduce a series of metrics that use large-scale vision-language
pre-training model CLIP to quantify the distinctiveness. To further improve the
distinctiveness of captioning models, we propose a simple and effective
training strategy that trains the model by comparing target image with similar
image group and optimizing the group embedding gap. Extensive experiments are
conducted on various baseline models to demonstrate the wide applicability of
our strategy and the consistency of metric results with human evaluation. By
comparing the performance of our best model with existing state-of-the-art
models, we claim that our model achieves new state-of-the-art towards
distinctiveness objective.

the low mass X-ray binary MXB 1659-29 indicates that the neutrino luminosity of
the neutron star core is consistent with direct Urca reactions occurring in
$\sim 1\%$ of the core volume. We investigate this scenario with neutron star
models that include a detailed equation of state parametrized by the slope of
the nuclear symmetry energy $L$, and a range of neutron and proton superfluid
gaps. We find that the predicted neutron star mass depends sensitively on $L$
and the assumed gaps. We discuss which combinations of superfluid gaps
reproduce the inferred neutrino luminosity. Larger values of $L\gtrsim 80\ {\rm
MeV}$ require superfluidity to suppress dUrca reactions in low mass neutron
stars, i.e. that the proton or neutron gap is sufficiently strong and extends
to high enough density. However, the largest gaps give masses near the maximum
mass, making it difficult to accommodate colder neutron stars. We consider
models with reduced dUrca normalization as an approximation of alternative,
less efficient, fast cooling processes in exotic cores. We find solutions with
a larger emitting volume, providing a more natural explanation for the observed
neutrino luminosity, provided the fast cooling process is within a factor of
$\sim 1000$ of dUrca. The heat capacities of our models span the range from
fully-paired to fully-unpaired nucleons meaning that long term observations of
core cooling could distinguish between models. We discuss the impact of future

We discuss three special cases of the age dependent switching rate: one in
which the concentration of voters can be approximated by a fractional

exponential in time, and a third case in which the system reaches a frozen

measurement of heat flux using commercial thermoelectric modules (TEMs). Two
different methods of measuring heat flux with TEMs are investigated, namely
passive mode based on the Seebeck effect and active mode based on the Peltier
effect. For both modes, a TEM as a heat fluxmeter is calibrated to show a
linear relation between the voltage across the TEM and the heat flow rate from
0 to 100 mW. While both modes exhibit sufficiently high sensitivities suitable
for low heat flow measurement, active mode is shown to be $\sim$7 times more
sensitive than passive mode. From the speculation on the origin of the
measurement uncertainty, we propose a dual TEM scheme by operating the top TEM
in passive mode while its bottom temperature maintains constant by the
feedback-controlled bottom TEM. The dual-TEM scheme can suppress the
sensitivity uncertainty by up to 4 times when compared to the single-TEM
passive mode by stabilizing the bottom temperature. The response time of a 1.5
cm $\times$ 1.5 cm TEM is measured to be 8.90 $\pm$ 0.97 seconds for heating
and 10.83 $\pm$ 0.65 seconds for cooling, which is slower than commercial heat
fluxmeters but still fast enough to measure heat flux with a time resolution on
the order of 10 seconds. We believe that the obtained results can facilitate
the use of a commercial TEM for heat flux measurement in various thermal

resolve the muon puzzle as quantified with data from the Pierre Auger
Observatory on the depth of the shower maximum and the number of muons at

number require strangeness enhancements already at energies accessible to
current-generation collider experiments. At Tevatron and LHC energies we
estimate 40% of the interactions to produce strangeballs, corresponding to a
5-9% increase of the average fraction of energy retained in the hadronic
cascade compared to predictions from current hadronic interaction models. A

directly exclude this scenario, though the obtained tension with LHCb suggests

a lower numerical diffusivity of our method. Similarly, the post-merger
gravitational wave emission shows the same features as observed in simulations
with other codes. In particular, the main frequency of the post-merger phase is

fractional statistics with potential application in topological quantum
computing. States lacking intrinsic TO can still be in topological phases
provided certain symmetries are imposed. On their own, these symmetry-protected
phases do not support anyons, but they can still have other interesting
features, such as protected boundary states. In this thesis we present our
research into several nontrivial systems. First, we present the results on
light propagation in the valley modes of inversion-symmetry broken honeycomb
lattices. We find that a rotating spiral pattern, leading to Zitterbewegung,
arises in the intensity profile of the beam as a result of the nontrivial
topology of the valleys. Next, we present the numerical demonstration of
dynamical topological phase transitions driven by nonlinearity of the photonic
medium, which occur in soliton SSH lattices. The phase transitions, marked by
the appearance of topological edge states in the band gap, occur due to the
setup which enables continually changing values of the intracell and intercell
soliton couplings. Finally, we propose a scheme for creating and manipulating
synthetic anyons in a noninteracting system by perturbing it with specially
tailored localized probes. The external probes are needed because
noninteracting systems do not possess the kind of TO required to support
anyons. We start from a 2DEG in a uniform magnetic field (in an integer QHE
state) and introduce thin solenoids carrying a fractional magnetic flux. We
find a suitable ground state and demonstrate the fractional braiding statistics

corresponding classic matrix decomposition would be a 1-line invocation with no
additional steps. We also suggest that by employing operator overloading in a
programming language, a numerical algorithm for computing a unitary
diagonalisation of a complex self-adjoint matrix would generalise immediately
to solving problems like SVD or Takagi. While algebras without nilpotents (like
the quaternions) allow for similar unifying behaviour, the classic matrix
decompositions which they unify are never obtained as easily. In the process of
doing this, we develop some spectral theory over Clifford algebras of the form
$\cl_{p,q,0}(\mathbb R)$ and $\cl_{p,q,1}(\mathbb R)$ where the former is
admittedly quite easy. We propose a broad conjecture about spectral theorems.

for any artificial intelligence tasked with satisfying human values or

human. Starting with principle of loss-aversion, we designed a set of soft
maximin function approaches to multi-objective decision-making. Bench-marking
these functions in a set of previously-developed environments, we found that
one new approach in particular, 'split-function exp-log loss aversion'
(SFELLA), learns faster than the state of the art thresholded alignment
objective method (Vamplew et al, 2021) on three of four tasks it was tested on,
and achieved the same optimal performance after learning. SFELLA also showed
relative robustness improvements against changes in objective scale, which may
highlight an advantage dealing with distribution shifts in the environment
dynamics. Due to publishing rules, further work could not be presented in the
preprint, but in the final published version, we will further compare SFELLA to
the multi-objective reward exponentials (MORE) approach (Rolf, 2020),
demonstrating that SFELLA performs similarly to MORE in a simple
previously-described foraging task, but in a modified foraging environment with
a new resource that was not depleted as the agent worked, SFELLA collected more
of the new resource with very little cost incurred in terms of the old
resource. Overall, we found SFELLA useful for avoiding problems that sometimes
occur with a thresholded approach, and more reward-responsive than MORE while
retaining its conservative, loss-averse incentive structure.

Given JUNO's high expected statistics [$\sim$100k IBD events ($\bar{\nu}_e p

resolution [$\sim$$0.03/\sqrt{E_{\mathrm{vis}}~\mathrm{(MeV)}}$], its

Unfortunately, this sensitivity may weaken the experiment's ability to measure
the orientation of the neutrino mass hierarchy for currently allowed values of
the wavepacket size. Here, we report both the JUNO experiment's ability to
determine the hierarchy orientation in the presence of a finite wavepacket and
its simultaneous sensitivity to size of the wavepacket and the hierarchy. We
find that wavepacket effects are relevant for the hierarchy determination up to
nearly two orders of magnitude above the current experimental lower limit on
the size, noting that there is no theoretical consensus on the expectation of
this value. We also consider the effect in the context of other aspects of
JUNO's nominal three-neutrino oscillation measurement physics program and the

neural network (PINN) to produce flow fields that simultaneously satisfy the
measurement data and governing equations. For the high-speed flows of interest
in this work, we specify a physics loss based on the Euler and irrotationality
equations. BOS is a quantitative fluid visualization technique that is used to
characterize high-speed flows. Images of a background pattern, positioned
behind the target flow, are processed using computer vision and tomography
algorithms to determine the density field. Crucially, BOS features a series of
ill-posed inverse problems that require supplemental information (i.e., in
addition to the images) to accurately reconstruct the flow. Current BOS
workflows rely upon interpolation of the images or a penalty term to promote a
globally- or piecewise-smooth solution. However, these algorithms are
invariably incompatible with the flow physics, leading to errors in the density
field. Physics-informed BOS directly reconstructs all the flow fields using a
PINN that includes the BOS measurement model and governing equations. This
procedure improves the accuracy of density estimates and also yields velocity
and pressure data, which was not previously available. We demonstrate our
approach by reconstructing synthetic data that corresponds to analytical and
numerical phantoms as well as experimental measurements. Our physics-informed
reconstructions are significantly more accurate than conventional BOS
estimates. Further, to the best of our knowledge, this work represents the
first use of a PINN to reconstruct a supersonic flow from experimental data of

class predictions with only image-level labels for training. To this end,
previous methods adopt the common pipeline: they generate pseudo masks from
class activation maps (CAMs) and use such masks to supervise segmentation
networks. However, it is challenging to derive comprehensive pseudo masks that
cover the whole extent of objects due to the local property of CAMs, i.e., they
tend to focus solely on small discriminative object parts. In this paper, we
associate the locality of CAMs with the texture-biased property of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Accordingly, we propose to exploit shape
information to supplement the texture-biased CNN features, thereby encouraging
mask predictions to be not only comprehensive but also well-aligned with object
boundaries. We further refine the predictions in an online fashion with a novel
refinement method that takes into account both the class and the color
affinities, in order to generate reliable pseudo masks to supervise the model.
Importantly, our model is end-to-end trained within a single-stage framework
and therefore efficient in terms of the training cost. Through extensive
experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012, we validate the effectiveness of our method in
producing precise and shape-aligned segmentation results. Specifically, our
model surpasses the existing state-of-the-art single-stage approaches by large

neutron star(NS)-NS or NS-black hole merger, taking into account the
radioactive heating by r-process nuclei formed in the first few seconds. We
find that the cumulative heating eventually exceeds the disk's binding energy
at t ~ 10^2 s (\alpha/0.1)^{-1.8} (M/2.6 Msun)^{1.8} after the merger, where
\alpha is the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter and M is the mass of the
remnant object. This causes the disk to evaporate rapidly and the jet power to
shut off. We propose that this is the cause of the steep flux decline at the
end of the extended emission (EE) or X-ray plateau seen in many short gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs). The shallow flux evolution before the steep decline is
consistent with a plausible scenario where the jet power scales linearly with
the disk mass. We suggest that the jets from NS mergers have two components --
a short-duration narrow one corresponding to the prompt gamma-ray emission and
a long-lasting wide component producing the EE. This leads to a prediction that
""orphan EE"" (without the prompt gamma-rays) may be a promising electromagnetic
counterpart for NS mergers observable by future wide-field X-ray surveys. The
long-lived disk produces a slow ejecta component that can efficiently
thermalize the energy carried by beta-decay electrons up to t ~ 100 d and
contributes 10% of the kilonova's bolometric luminosity at these late epochs.
We predict that future ground-based and JWST near-IR spectroscopy of nearby (<

  phase transition in the neutron star equation of state","14 pages, 9 figures",,,,"astro-ph.HE nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Studying the properties of ultra-dense matter is one of the key goals of
modern neutron star research. The measurement of the tidal deformability from
the inspiral of a binary neutron star merger offers one promising method for
constraining the equation of state (EoS) of cold, dense matter. In this work,
we report on a new class of EoSs which have significantly different pressures
at nuclear densities and large differences in stellar radii, but that predict
surprisingly similar tidal deformabilities across the entire range of
astrophysically-observed neutron star masses. Using a survey of 5 million
piecewise polytropic EoSs, subject to four different sets of nuclear priors, we
demonstrate that these ""tidal deformability doppelgangers"" occur generically.
We find that they can differ substantially in the pressure (by up to a factor
of 3 at nuclear densities) and in the radius of intermediate-mass neutron stars
(by up to 0.5 km), but are observationally indistinguishable in their tidal
deformabilities (\Delta\Lambda < 30) with the sensitivity of current
gravitational wave detectors. We demonstrate that this near-degeneracy in the
tidal deformability is a result of allowing for a phase transition at low
densities. We show that a combination of input from nuclear theory (e.g., from
chiral effective field theory), X-ray observations of neutron star radii,
and/or the next generation of gravitational wave detectors will be able to
significantly constrain these tidal deformability doppelgangers.

traffic assignment. Because of the automation of the implementation, numerous

versus the previously published core methodology includes an analysis to ensure
the obtained data is appropriate since some data sources were disabled due to
the ongoing disruption. Further, novelty includes a direct linkage of the
analysis to the timeline of disruptions to examine the interaction in a new

suited for conceptualizing the impact of conflict disruptions on traffic
network conditions. The ultimate aim is to establish processes, concepts and
analysis to advance the broader activity of rapidly quantifying the traffic

A new numerical estimator is proposed that demonstrates an empirical

theoretical extension is made to define conditional sensitivity indices, which
reveal the degree that the inputs carry shared information about the output

experiment shows the self-consistent creation of a CBP through the action of
the stochastic granular motions alone, mediated by magnetic reconnection in the
corona. The reconnection is intermittent and oscillatory, and it leads to
coronal and transition-region temperature loops that are identifiable in our
EUV/UV observables. During the CBP lifetime, convergence and cancellation at
the surface of its underlying opposite polarities takes place. The chromosphere
below the CBP shows a number of peculiar features concerning its density and
the spicules in it. The final stage of the CBP is eruptive: magnetic flux
emergence at the granular scale disrupts the CBP topology, leading to different

investigate the joint evolution of star-formation activity and structural
properties. We find significant correlations between the SFH of the galaxies
and their morphology. Compared to extended SFGs, compact SFGs are more likely
to have experienced multiple star-formation episodes, with the fractional mass
formed during the older ($\ge1$ Gyr) episode being larger, suggesting that
high-redshift SFGs assembled their central regions earlier and then kept
growing in central mass as they become more compact. The SFH of compact QGs
does not significantly differ from the average for this category, and shows an
early burst followed by a gradual decline of the star formation rate. The SFH
of extended QGs, however, is similar to that of post-starburst galaxies and
their morphology is also frequently disturbed. Knowledge of the SFH also
enables us to empirically reconstruct the structural evolution of individual
galaxies. While the progenitor effect is clearly observed and accounted for in
our analysis, it alone is insufficient to explain the observed structural
evolution. We show that, as they evolve from star-forming phase to quiescence,
galaxies grow massive dense stellar cores. Quenching begins at the center and
then propagates outward to the rest of the structure. We discuss possible
physical scenarios for the observed evolution and find that our empirical
constraints are in good quantitative agreement with the model predictions from
dissipative accretion of gas to the center followed by massive starbursts
before final quiescence (wet compaction).

formation should result in some contraction of the halo as the combined system
settles into equilibrium. We quantify this effect on the cuspy primordial halos
predicted by DM-only simulations for the baryon distributions observed in the
galaxies of the SPARC database. We find that the DM halos of high surface
brightness galaxies (with $\Sigma_{\rm eff}\gtrsim100$ $L_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ at
3.6 $\mu$m) experience strong contraction. Halos become more cuspy as a result
of compression: the inner DM density slope increases with the baryonic surface
mass density. We iteratively fit rotation curves to find the balance between
initial halo parameters (constrained by abundance matching), compression, and
stellar mass-to-light ratio. The resulting fits often require lower stellar
masses than expected for stellar populations, particularly in galaxies with
bulges: stellar mass must be reduced to make room for the DM it compresses.
This trade off between dark and luminous mass is reminiscent of the cusp-core
problem in dwarf galaxies, but occurs in more massive systems: the
present-epoch DM halos cannot follow from cuspy primordial halos unless (1) the
stellar mass-to-light ratios are systematically smaller than expected from
standard stellar population synthesis models, and/or (2) there is a net outward
mass redistribution from the initial cusp, even in massive galaxies widely
considered to be immune from such effects.

forward model the full selection function of H3 to infer the density profile of
this accreted component of the stellar halo. We consider a general ellipsoid
with principal axes allowed to rotate with respect to the Galactocentric axes,
coupled with a multiply-broken power law. The best-fit model is a triaxial
ellipsoid (axes ratios 10:8:7) tilted $25^\circ$ above the Galactic plane
towards the Sun and a doubly-broken power law with breaking radii at 12 kpc and
28 kpc. This result resolves the long-standing dichotomy in literature values
of the halo breaking radius, being at either $\sim15\text{ kpc}$ or
$\sim30\text{ kpc}$ assuming a singly-broken power law. N-body simulations
suggest that the breaking radii are connected to apocenter pile-ups of stellar
orbits, and so the observed double-break provides new insight into the initial
conditions and evolution of the GSE merger. Furthermore, the tilt and
triaxiality of the stellar halo could imply that a fraction of the underlying
dark matter halo is also tilted and triaxial. This has important implications
for dynamical mass modeling of the Galaxy as well as direct dark matter
detection experiments.

stellar masses of these galaxies, consistent with a Chabrier initial mass
function (IMF). Considered alongside previous studies of massive quiescent
galaxies across $0.2<z<4.0$, there is evidence for an evolution in the relation
between the dynamical mass - stellar mass ratio and velocity dispersion as a
function of redshift. This implies an IMF with fewer low mass stars (e.g.,
Chabrier IMF) for massive quiescent galaxies at higher redshifts in conflict
with the bottom-heavy IMF (e.g., Salpeter IMF) found in their likely $z\sim0$
descendants, though a number of alternative explanations such as a different
dynamical structure or significant rotation are not ruled out. Similar to data
at lower redshifts, we see evidence for an increase of IMF normalization with
velocity dispersion, though the $z\gtrsim3$ trend is steeper than that for

has been shown to be an effective agent in disrupting protoplanetary discs.
External photoevaporation leads to the inward evolution of the radii of discs,
whereas the internal viscous evolution of the disc causes the radii to evolve
outwards. We couple N-body simulations of star-forming regions with a
post-processing analysis of disc evolution to determine how the radius and mass
distributions of protoplanetary discs evolve in young star-forming regions. To
be consistent with observations, we find that the initial disc radii must be of
order 100au, even though these discs are readily destroyed by photoevaporation
from massive stars. Furthermore, the observed disc radii distribution in the
Orion Nebula Cluster is more consistent with moderate initial stellar densities
(100M$_\odot$ pc$^{-3}$), in tension with dynamical models that posit much
higher inital densities for the ONC. Furthermore, we cannot reproduce the
observed disc radius distribution in the Lupus star-forming region if its discs
are subject to external photoevaporation. A more detailed comparison is not
possible due to the well-documented uncertainties in determining the ages of

used as tracers of old, metal-poor stellar populations. However, mounting
observational evidence shows that a significant fraction of these stars may be
young and metal-rich. Here, through detailed binary stellar evolution
modelling, we show that all such metal-rich RR Lyrae can be naturally produced
through binary interactions. Binary companions of such RR Lyrae partly strip
their progenitor's envelopes during a preceding red giant phase. As a result,
stripped horizontal branch stars become bluer compared to their isolated
stellar evolution counterparts and thus end up in the instability strip. In
contrast, in the single evolution scenario, the stars can attain such colours
only at large age and low metallicity. While RR Lyrae from binary evolution
generally can have any ages and metallicities, the Galactic population is
relatively young (1 - 9 Gyr) and dominated by the Thin Disc and the Bulge. We
show that Galactic RR Lyrae from binary evolution are produced at rates
compatible with the observed metal-rich population and have consistent G-band
magnitudes, Galactic kinematics and pulsation properties. Furthermore, these
systems dominate the RR Lyrae population in the Solar Neighbourhood. We predict
that all metal-rich RR Lyrae have a long-period (P > 1000 d) A, F, G or K-type
companion. Observationally characterising the orbital periods and masses of
such stellar companions will provide valuable new constraints on mass and
angular momentum-loss efficiency for Sun-like accretors and the nature of RR

the distribution of conversion ratios at fixed energy and find that it follows
an exponential law. We find that the MHD models agree with the exponential law
for typical, small amplitude mixings but exhibit distinctly heavy tails for
rare and large mixings. We explain how non-Gaussian, local spikes in the MHD

that limits placed on ALPs using GRFs are conservative but that MHD models are

original fields by a canonical transformation. The action for $\psi$ has the
form of a systematic gradient expansion. At every order of the expansion, such

explains their longevity. Importantly, it also provides reliable selection
criteria for models with long-lived oscillons. This technique is more precise
in the nonrelativistic limit, in the notable cases of nonlinear, extremely

the effective theory by performing explicit numerical simulations of a

spectrum, H$_{2}$O is not frequently exploited as an ISM tracer in distant

low mass stars, including the majority of known exoplanet hosts. Unfortunately,
strong attenuation by the interstellar medium (ISM) obscures the line core at
most stars, requiring the intrinsic Lyman alpha flux to be reconstructed based
on fits to the line wings. We present a test of the widely-used Lyman alpha
emission line reconstruction code LYAPY using phase-resolved, medium-resolution
STIS G140M observations of the close white dwarf-M dwarf binary EG UMa. The
Doppler shifts induced by the binary orbital motion move the Lyman alpha
emission line in and out of the region of strong ISM attenuation.
Reconstructions to each spectrum should produce the same Lyman alpha profile
regardless of phase, under the well-justified assumption that there is no
intrinsic line variability between observations. Instead, we find that the
reconstructions underestimate the Lyman alpha flux by almost a factor of two
for the lowest-velocity, most attenuated spectrum, due to a degeneracy between
the intrinsic Lyman alpha and ISM profiles. Our results imply that many stellar
Lyman alpha fluxes derived from G140M spectra reported in the literature may be
underestimated, with potential consequences for, for example, estimates of
extreme-ultraviolet stellar spectra and ultraviolet inputs into simulations of
exoplanet atmospheres.

ceiling. Here, we study whether a metallicity ceiling can exist in quasar disks
due to the evolution of embedded stars. We develop a simple model that starts
with gas in a closed box, which is enriched by cycles of stellar evolution
until eventually newly formed stars undergo significant mass loss before they
reach the supernovae stage and no further enrichment is possible. Using the
MESA code, we create a grid over a parameter space of masses ($>8~M_\odot$) and
metallicities ($1-10~Z_\odot$), and locate portions of the parameter space
where mass loss via winds occurs on a timescale shorter than the lifetime of
the stars. We find that for reasonable assumptions about stellar winds,
sufficiently massive ($8-22~M_\odot$) and metal-rich ($\sim9~Z_\odot$) stars
lose significant mass via winds and fail to evolve to the supernovae stage,
thereby failing to enrich and increase the metallicity of their surroundings.
This suggests that a metallicity ceiling is the final state of a closed-box
system of gas and stars.

exploring fundamental phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) and
are commonly used in quantum devices acting as qubits, memories and
transducers. Many previous experimental cQED studies have focused on regimes in
which a small number of identical emitters interact with a weak external drive,
such that the system can be described with simple, effective models. However,
the dynamics of a disordered, many-body quantum system subject to a strong
drive have not been fully explored, despite its importance and potential in
quantum applications. Here we study how a large, inhomogeneously broadened
ensemble of solid-state emitters coupled with high cooperativity to a
nanophotonic resonator behaves under strong excitation. We discover a sharp,
collectively induced transparency (CIT) in the cavity reflection spectrum,
resulting from quantum interference and collective response induced by the
interplay between driven inhomogeneous emitters and cavity photons.
Furthermore, coherent excitation within the CIT window leads to highly
nonlinear optical emission, spanning from fast superradiance to slow
subradiance. These phenomena in the many-body cQED regime enable new mechanisms
for achieving slow light and frequency referencing, pave a way towards
solid-state superradiant lasers and inform the development of ensemble-based
quantum interconnects.

remove rain, without diminishing the quality of the image contents. This
article aims to develop a novel quaternion multi-stage multiscale neural

The novelty of this algorithm is that it requires significantly fewer
parameters by a factor of 3.98, over prior methods, while improving visual
quality. This is demonstrated by the extensive evaluation and benchmarking on
synthetic and real-world rainy images. This feature of QSAM-Net makes the
network suitable for implementation on edge devices and applications requiring
near real-time performance. The experiments demonstrate that by improving the
visual quality of images. In addition, object detection accuracy and training

Through an extensive set of experiments, we investigate what model

block-local Transformer with global encoder tokens strikes a good balance of

our findings, we introduce PEGASUS-X, an extension of the PEGASUS model with
additional long input pretraining to handle inputs of up to 16K tokens.
PEGASUS-X achieves strong performance on long input summarization tasks

formulating the quantized downlink (DL) OFDM antenna power minimax problem and

interpreting the dual as a virtual quantized uplink (UL) OFDM problem, and (3)
developing an iterative minimax algorithm to identify a feasible solution based

Specifically, the dual problem requires joint optimization of virtual UL

derive the optimal dual solution of the UL problem for given noise covariance
matrices. Then, we use the solution to compute the associated DL beamformer.
Subsequently, using the DL beamformer we update the UL noise covariance

by repeating the steps for optimizing DL beamformers. Simulations validate the
proposed algorithm in terms of the maximum antenna transmit power and

out as one of the key challenges in high-performance face recognition. Recent
attempts have been made to cope with this challenge by alleviating the
intra-class conflict and inter-class conflict. However, the unconstrained noise
type in each conflict still makes it difficult for these algorithms to perform
well. To better understand this, we reformulate the noise type of each class in
a more fine-grained manner as N-identities|K^C-clusters. Different types of
noisy faces can be generated by adjusting the values of \nkc. Based on this
unified formulation, we found that the main barrier behind the noise-robust
representation learning is the flexibility of the algorithm under different N,
K, and C. For this potential problem, we propose a new method, named Evolving
Sub-centers Learning~(ESL), to find optimal hyperplanes to accurately describe
the latent space of massive noisy faces. More specifically, we initialize M
sub-centers for each class and ESL encourages it to be automatically aligned to
N-identities|K^C-clusters faces via producing, merging, and dropping
operations. Images belonging to the same identity in noisy faces can
effectively converge to the same sub-center and samples with different
identities will be pushed away. We inspect its effectiveness with an elaborate
ablation study on the synthetic noisy dataset with different N, K, and C.
Without any bells and whistles, ESL can achieve significant performance gains

This can be achieved for a given stochastic CM by constructing an associated

the mixedness of the ancilla's initial state of the latter, introducing at the

modes reinforce each other in the fragmentation of a current sheet in the solar
corona through an explosive reconnection process, characterized by the
formation of plasmoids which interact and trap condensing plasma. We use a
resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of a 2D current layer,
incorporating the non-adiabatic effects of optically thin radiative energy loss
and background heating using \texttt{MPI-AMRVAC}. Our parametric survey
explores different resistivities and plasma-$\beta$ to quantify the instability
growth rate in the linear and nonlinear regimes. We notice that for
dimensionless resistivity values within $10^{-4} - 5 \times 10^{-3}$, we get
explosive behavior where thermal instability and tearing behavior reinforce
each other. This is clearly below the usual critical Lundquist number range of
pure resistive explosive plasmoid formation. The non-linear growth rates follow
weak power-law dependency with resistivity. The fragmentation of the current
sheet and the formation of the plasmoids in the nonlinear phase of the
evolution due to the thermal and tearing instabilities are obtained. The
formation of plasmoids is noticed for the Lundquist number ($S_L$) range $4.6
\times 10^3 - 2.34 \times 10^5$. We quantify the temporal variation of the
plasmoid numbers and the density filling factor of the plasmoids for different
physical conditions. We also find that the maximum plasmoid numbers scale as
$S_L^{0.223}$. Within the nonlinearly coalescing plasmoid chains, localized
cool condensations gather, realizing density and temperature contrasts similar
to coronal rain or prominences.

expressions, numerical relativity (NR), and black hole perturbation theory,
produce results that are in different BMS frames. Consequently, to build a
model for the waveforms produced during the merging of compact objects, which
ideally would be a hybridization of PN, NR, and black hole perturbation theory,
one needs a fast and robust method for fixing the BMS freedoms. In this work,
we present the first means of fixing the entire BMS freedom of NR waveforms to
match the frame of either PN waveforms or black hole perturbation theory. We
achieve this by finding the BMS transformations that change certain charges in
a prescribed way -- e.g., finding the center-of-mass transformation that maps
the center-of-mass charge to a mean of zero. We find that this new method is 20
times faster, and more correct when mapping to the superrest frame, than
previous methods that relied on optimization algorithms. Furthermore, in the
course of developing this charge-based frame fixing method, we compute the PN
expression for the Moreschi supermomentum to 3PN order without spins and 2PN
order with spins. This Moreschi supermomentum is effectively equivalent to the
energy flux or the null memory contribution at future null infinity
$\mathscr{I}^{+}$. From this PN calculation, we also compute oscillatory

drilling defects in X-ray images of turbine blades. The application is
challenging due to the large image resolutions in which defects are very small
and hardly captured by the commonly used anchor sizes, and also due to the
small size of the available dataset. As a matter of fact, all these issues are
pretty common in the application of Deep Learning-based object detection models
to industrial defect data. We overcome such issues using open source models,
splitting the input images into tiles and scaling them up, applying heavy data
augmentation, and optimizing the anchor size and aspect ratios with a
differential evolution solver. We validate the model with $3$-fold
cross-validation, showing a very high accuracy in identifying images with
defects. We also define a set of best practices which can help other
practitioners overcome similar challenges.

three-dimensional space is challenging. The difficulties come from two aspects:
the existing geometry processing or forward simulation methods penalize the
difference between the current status and the rest configuration to maintain
the initial shape, which will lead to sharp spikes or wiggles for large
deformations; the co-dimensional nature of the problem makes it more
complicated because the deformed surface has to locally satisfy compatibility
conditions on fundamental forms to guarantee a feasible solution exists. To
address these two challenges, we propose a rotation-strain method to modify the
fundamental forms in a compatible way, and model the large deformation of
surface meshes smoothly using plasticity. The user prescribes the positions of
a few vertices, and our method finds a smooth strain and rotation field under
which the surface meets the target positions. We demonstrate several examples
whereby triangle meshes are smoothly deformed to large strains while meeting

remains difficult, hence the desire to predict them computationally from
sequence information. However, correctly predicting even the base pairs
involved in the folded structure of an RNA, known as secondary structure, from
its sequence using minimum free energy models is understood to be NP-hard.
Classical approaches rely on heuristics or avoid considering pseudoknots in

and demonstrable advantages in certain domains, including combinatorial
optimization, quantum computing approaches by contrast have the potential to
compute the full RNA folding problem while remaining more feasible and exact.

overfitting. We speculate that generalization properties of MPS depend on the
properties of data: with one-dimensional data (for which the MPS ansatz is the
most suitable) MPS is prone to overfitting, while with more complex data which
cannot be fit by MPS exactly, overfitting may be much less significant.

complex configuration spaces of not only machine learning (ML) components and
their hyperparameters but also ways of composing them together, i.e. forming ML
pipelines. Optimisation efficiency and the model accuracy attainable for a
fixed time budget suffer if this pipeline configuration space is excessively
large. A key research question is whether it is both possible and practical to
preemptively avoid costly evaluations of poorly performing ML pipelines by
leveraging their historical performance for various ML tasks, i.e.
meta-knowledge. The previous experience comes in the form of
classifier/regressor accuracy rankings derived from either (1) a substantial
but non-exhaustive number of pipeline evaluations made during historical AutoML
runs, i.e. 'opportunistic' meta-knowledge, or (2) comprehensive cross-validated
evaluations of classifiers/regressors with default hyperparameters, i.e.
'systematic' meta-knowledge. Numerous experiments with the AutoWeka4MCPS
package suggest that (1) opportunistic/systematic meta-knowledge can improve ML
outcomes, typically in line with how relevant that meta-knowledge is, and (2)
configuration-space culling is optimal when it is neither too conservative nor
too radical. However, the utility and impact of meta-knowledge depend
critically on numerous facets of its generation and exploitation, warranting
extensive analysis; these are often overlooked/underappreciated within AutoML
and meta-learning literature. In particular, we observe strong sensitivity to
the `challenge' of a dataset, i.e. whether specificity in choosing a predictor

datasets, thus defined, is crucial to both generating informative

where responses from multiple response generators produced for the same dialog

driven with spin-orbit torques with a deflected trajectory. However, pinning
slows skyrmions down and alters their trajectory, which prevents a quantitative
comparison to analytical models. Here, we study skyrmions driven by spin-orbit
torques at room temperature in ferrimagnetic GdCo thin films, an amorphous
material with low pinning. Above a sharp current depinning threshold, we
observe a clearly linear velocity increase with current that extrapolates to
zero and a constant deflection angle, reaching high velocities up to 200 m/s.
The mobility increases and the depinning threshold current decreases with the
skyrmion diameter, which we vary using an external magnetic field. An
analytical model based on the Thiele equation quantitatively reproduces these
findings with a single fitting parameter. This validates the linear flow regime
description and shows, in particular, the important role of skyrmion size in
its dynamics.

  Precipitation Predictability",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Multimodel ensembling has been widely used to improve climate model
predictions, and the improvement strongly depends on the ensembling scheme. In
this work, we propose a Bayesian neural network (BNN) ensembling method, which
combines climate models within a Bayesian model averaging framework, to improve
the predictive capability of model ensembles. Our proposed BNN approach
calculates spatiotemporally varying model weights and biases by leveraging
individual models' simulation skill, calibrates the ensemble prediction against
observations by considering observation data uncertainty, and quantifies
epistemic uncertainty when extrapolating to new conditions. More importantly,
the BNN method provides interpretability about which climate model contributes
more to the ensemble prediction at which locations and times. Thus, beyond its
predictive capability, the method also brings insights and understanding of the
models to guide further model and data development. In this study, we apply the
BNN weighting scheme to an ensemble of CMIP6 climate models for monthly
precipitation prediction over the conterminous United States. In both synthetic
and real case studies, we demonstrate that BNN produces predictions of monthly
precipitation with higher accuracy than three baseline ensembling methods. BNN
can correctly assign a larger weight to the regions and seasons where the
individual model fits the observation better. Moreover, its offered
interpretability is consistent with our understanding of localized climate
model performance. Additionally, BNN shows an increasing uncertainty when the
prediction is farther away from the period with constrained data, which
appropriately reflects our predictive confidence and trustworthiness of the
models in the changing climate.

assume partial observability, where the state evolution of only a subset of
nodes comprising the network is observed. We devise a new feature vector
computed from the observed time series and prove that these features are
linearly separable, i.e., there exists a hyperplane that separates the cluster
of features associated with connected pairs of nodes from those associated with
disconnected pairs. This renders the features amenable to train a variety of
classifiers to perform causal inference. In particular, we use these features
to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The resulting causal inference
mechanism outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts w.r.t. sample-complexity.
The trained CNNs generalize well over structurally distinct networks (dense or

real-world networks while trained over a synthetic network (realization of a
random graph). Finally, the proposed method consistently reconstructs the graph

calibration error. Established calibration approaches in the field require an
exquisitely accurate sky model, and low-level sky model errors introduce
calibration errors that corrupt the cosmological signal. We present a novel
calibration approach called Delay-Weighted Calibration, or DWCal, that enables
precise calibration even in the presence of sky model error. Sky model error
does not affect all power spectrum modes equally, and DWCal fits calibration
solutions preferentially from error-free modes. We apply this technique to
simulated data, showing that it substantially reduces calibration error in the
presence of realistic levels of sky model error and can improve 21 cm power
spectrum sensitivity by approximately 2 orders of magnitude.

decomposing the acquired relaxation profiles into relaxation contributions

  For the parameters identification, we propose an algorithm that computes, at

Balancing Principle and the model parameters values are obtained by solving the

the non-linear Gauss-Seidel method. We analyse the convergence properties of

which takes statistically simple parameters as input and outputs subsurface

operation, as a function of the entanglement fidelity of the overall dynamics.
The lower bound for the diamond distance has a simple form, and a potentially
broader range of applicability in quantum information. I provide
information-theoretic characterizations of the incomplete knowledge of the
noise parameter to the lower bound, using both diamond distance and quantum
Fisher information. Finally, I provide fundamental bounds for multi-cycle
recovery in the form of recurrence inequalities. The latter suggests that
incomplete knowledge could be an advantage, as errors from various cycles can
cohere. These results are illustrated for the approximate [4,1] code of the
amplitude-damping channel and relations to various fields are discussed.

one's belief against objective data. But interpreting visualized data is a
complex perceptual and cognitive process. Through two crowdsourced experiments,
we demonstrate that supposedly objective assessments of the strength of a
correlational relationship can be influenced by how strongly a viewer believes
in the existence of that relationship. Participants viewed scatterplots
depicting a relationship between meaningful variable pairs (e.g., number of
environmental regulations and air quality) and estimated their correlations.
They also estimated the correlation of the same scatterplots labeled instead
with generic 'X' and 'Y' axes. In a separate section, they also reported how
strongly they believed there to be a correlation between the meaningful
variable pairs. Participants estimated correlations more accurately when they
viewed scatterplots labeled with generic axes compared to scatterplots labeled
with meaningful variable pairs. Furthermore, when viewers believed that two
variables should have a strong relationship, they overestimated correlations
between those variables by an r-value of about 0.1. When they believed that the
variables should be unrelated, they underestimated the correlations by an
r-value of about 0.1. While data visualizations are typically thought to
present objective truths to the viewer, these results suggest that existing

for long-term habitability as it controls the orbital evolution and ultimately
the stellar fluxes received by the planet. With an ensemble of n-body
simulations and obliquity models of hypothetical planetary systems, we
demonstrate that the amplitude and period of eccentricity, obliquity, and
precession cycles of an Earth-like planet are sensitive to the orbital
characteristics of a giant companion planet. A series of transient,
ocean-coupled climate simulations show how these characteristics of
astronomical cycles are decisive for the evolving surface conditions and
long-term fractional habitability relative to the modern Earth. The
habitability of Earth-like planets increases with the eccentricity of a
Jupiter-like companion, provided that the mean obliquity is sufficiently low to
maintain temperate temperatures over large parts of its surface throughout the
orbital year. A giant companion closer in results in shorter eccentricity
cycles of an Earth-like planet but longer, high-amplitude, obliquity cycles.
The period and amplitude of obliquity cycles can be estimated to first order
from the orbital pathways calculated by the n-body simulations. In the majority
of simulations, obliquity amplitude relates directly to the orbital inclination
whereas the period of obliquity cycles is a function of nodal precession and
the proximity of a giant companion.

readers interpret key messages. However, we know very little about how chart
designs might influence readers' perceptions of the people behind the data.
Specifically, could designs interact with readers' social cognitive biases in
ways that perpetuate harmful stereotypes? For example, when analyzing social
inequality, bar charts are a popular choice to present outcome disparities
between race, gender, or other groups. But bar charts may encourage deficit
thinking, the perception that outcome disparities are caused by groups'
personal strengths or deficiencies, rather than external factors. These faulty
personal attributions can then reinforce stereotypes about the groups being
visualized. We conducted four experiments examining design choices that
influence attribution biases (and therefore deficit thinking). Crowdworkers
viewed visualizations depicting social outcomes that either mask variability in
data, such as bar charts or dot plots, or emphasize variability in data, such
as jitter plots or prediction intervals. They reported their agreement with
both personal and external explanations for the visualized disparities.
Overall, when participants saw visualizations that hide within-group
variability, they agreed more with personal explanations. When they saw
visualizations that emphasize within-group variability, they agreed less with
personal explanations. These results demonstrate that data visualizations about
social inequity can be misinterpreted in harmful ways and lead to stereotyping.
Design choices can influence these biases: Hiding variability tends to increase
stereotyping while emphasizing variability reduces it.

novel text-to-image modern Hopfield network (Txt2Img-MHN). The main idea of
Txt2Img-MHN is to conduct hierarchical prototype learning on both text and
image embeddings with modern Hopfield layers. Instead of directly learning
concrete but highly diverse text-image joint feature representations for
different semantics, Txt2Img-MHN aims to learn the most representative
prototypes from text-image embeddings, achieving a coarse-to-fine learning
strategy. These learned prototypes can then be utilized to represent more
complex semantics in the text-to-image generation task. To better evaluate the
realism and semantic consistency of the generated images, we further conduct
zero-shot classification on real remote sensing data using the classification
model trained on synthesized images. Despite its simplicity, we find that the
overall accuracy in the zero-shot classification may serve as a good metric to
evaluate the ability to generate an image from text. Extensive experiments on

an algorithm to generate \textit{safe prices}. This means that at no iteration
should the realized demand in response to the posted prices violate the safety
constraints of the network. Thus, in contrast to existing first-order methods,
our algorithm, called the safe dual gradient method (SDGM), is guaranteed to
produce feasible primal iterates at all iterations. We ensure primal
feasibility by 1) adding a diminishing safety margin to the constraints, and 2)
using a sign-based dual update method with different step sizes for plus and

observed compression ratios on the order of $10\times$ to more than $100\times$

converters (ADCs) is a limiting factor in implementing large-bandwidth mm-wave
communication systems. A mitigating solution, which has drawn considerable
recent interest, is to use a few low-resolution ADCs at the receiver. While
reducing the number and resolution of the ADCs decreases power consumption, it
also leads to a reduction in channel capacity due to the information loss
induced by coarse quantization. This implies a rate-energy tradeoff governed by
the number and resolution of ADCs. Recently, it was shown that given a fixed
number of low-resolution ADCs, the application of practically implementable
nonlinear analog operators, prior to sampling and quantization, may
significantly reduce the aforementioned rate-loss. Building upon these
observations, this work focuses on single-input single-output (SISO)
communication scenarios, and i) characterizes capacity expressions under
various assumptions on the set of implementable nonlinear analog functions, ii)
provides computational methods to calculate the channel capacity numerically,

analytically characterize the bullwhip effect in general supply chain networks

is founded on the control-theoretic approach, and (ii) not all suppliers have a
unique layer position due to the presence of intra-layer links or inter-layer

use both the absorbing Markov chain and the control-theoretic approach. We then
investigate how network structures impact the BWE of supply chain networks. In
particular, we analytically show that (i) if the market demand is generated
from the same stationary process, the structure of supply networks does not
affect the layer-wise bullwhip effect of supply networks, and (ii) if the
market demand is generated from different stationary or non-stationary market

function, enforcing a fixed mapping of inputs to subnetworks (e.g., the Mixture
of Experts (MoE) paradigm in Switch Transformers). However, prior work is
largely empirical, and while existing routing functions work well in practice,

first contribution, we present a formal model of data-dependent sparse networks

routing function based on locality sensitive hashing (LSH) that enables us to
reason about how well sparse networks approximate target functions. After
representing LSH-based sparse networks with our model, we prove that sparse
networks can match the approximation power of dense networks on Lipschitz

There are several types of noise in sounds, for example, environmental noise
and generated frequency-dependent noise from signal processing methods. Noise
generated by environmental activities is environmental noise. In the factory,
environmental noise can be created by vehicles, drilling, people working or
talking in the survey area, wind, and flowing water. Those noises appear as
spikes in the sound record. In the scope of this paper, we demonstrate the
removal of generated noise with Gaussian distribution and the environmental
noise with a specific example of the water sink faucet noise from the induction
motor sounds. The proposed method was trained and verified on 49 normal
function sounds and 197 horizontal misalignment fault sounds from the Machinery
Fault Database (MAFAULDA). The mean square error (MSE) was used as the
assessment criteria to evaluate the similarity between denoised sounds using
the proposed autoencoder and the original sounds in the test set. The MSE is
below or equal to 0.14 when denoise both types of noises on 15 testing sounds
of the normal function category. The MSE is below or equal to 0.15 when
denoising 60 testing sounds on the horizontal misalignment fault category. The
low MSE shows that both the generated Gaussian noise and the environmental
noise were almost removed from the original sounds with the proposed trained
autoencoder.

Specifically, the disintegrating nuclei have a median radius of only 0.41 km,
one quarter of the 1.60 km median radius of those surviving perihelion. The
disintegrating comets also have a smaller median perihelion distance (0.48 au)
than do the survivors (0.99 au). We compare the order of magnitude timescale
for outgassing torques to change the nucleus spin, tau, with the time spent by
each comet in strong sublimation, Dt, finding that the disrupted comets are
those with tau < Dt. The destruction of near-Sun long-period comets is thus
naturally explained as a consequence of rotational break-up. We discuss this
process as a contributor to Oort's long mysterious ``fading parameter''.

governing electro-mechanical equations are ill-conditioned or singular. This
ill-conditioning is because of converter-interfaced power systems generators'
zero or small inertia contribution. Consequently, the overall system inertia
decreases, resulting in low-inertia power systems. We show that the standard
state-space model based on least squares or subspace estimators fails to exist
for these models. We overcome this challenge by considering a least-squares
estimator directly on the coupled swing-equation model but not on its
transformed first-order state-space form. We specifically focus on estimating
inertia (mechanical and virtual) and damping constants, although our method is
general enough for estimating other parameters. Our theoretical analysis
highlights the role of network topology on the parameter estimates of an
individual generator. For generators with greater connectivity, estimation of
the associated parameters is more susceptible to variations in other generator
states. Furthermore, we numerically show that estimating the parameters by
ignoring their ill-conditioning aspects yields highly unreliable results.

traffic inflow to alleviate hypercongestion. Implementation of transit priority
with perimeter control measures, which allow transit into a controlled area
without queuing at the perimeter boundary, is an effective strategy in bimodal
transportation systems. However, travelers' behavior changes in response to
perimeter control strategies, such as shifts in their departure times and
transportation modes, have not been fully investigated. Therefore, important
questions remain, such as the use of transit during perimeter control with
transit priority. This paper examines the travelers' behavior changes in
response to perimeter control with transit priority in a mixed bimodal
transportation system with cars and flexible route transit (FRT) vehicles. We
model departure time and transportation mode choices in such a transportation
system with hypercongestion and discomfort in FRT (called the mixed bimodal
bathtub model). Initially, we investigate the properties of dynamic user
equilibrium without perimeter control. Then, we study the equilibrium patterns
during perimeter control with transit priority. Unlike existing works, we find
that the number of FRT passengers decreases with time toward the desired
arrival time and that FRT may not be used around the peak of rush hour.
Furthermore, transit priority may not be sufficient to promote the use of FRT,
and additional incentive such as subsidy for lower fares may be required to
encourage FRT use during perimeter control. Finally, we show that operating
many FRT vehicles does not always decrease the equilibrium cost, even under
perimeter control with transit priority.

Utilizing this tool, we demonstrate photonic mode conversion between two
Laguerre-Gaussian modes of a twisted optical cavity with high efficiency. We
spatiotemporally modulate the optical susceptibility of an atomic sample that
sits at the cavity waist using an auxiliary Stark-shifting beam, in effect
creating a mode-coupling optic that converts modes of orbital angular momentum
$l=3\rightarrow l=0$. The internal conversion efficiency saturates near unity
as a function of the atom number and modulation beam intensity, finding
application in topological few-body state preparation, quantum communication,

prediction from the view of the model performance and memory usage. The
embedding table is a two-dimensional tensor, with its axes indicating the
number of feature values and the embedding dimension, respectively. To learn an
efficient and effective embedding table, recent works either assign various
embedding dimensions for feature fields and reduce the number of embeddings
respectively or mask the embedding table parameters. However, all these
existing works cannot get an optimal embedding table. On the one hand, various
embedding dimensions still require a large amount of memory due to the vast
number of features in the dataset. On the other hand, decreasing the number of
embeddings usually suffers from performance degradation, which is intolerable
in CTR prediction. Finally, pruning embedding parameters will lead to a sparse
embedding table, which is hard to be deployed. To this end, we propose an
optimal embedding table learning framework OptEmbed, which provides a practical
and general method to find an optimal embedding table for various base CTR
models. Specifically, we propose pruning the redundant embeddings regarding
corresponding features' importance by learnable pruning thresholds.
Furthermore, we consider assigning various embedding dimensions as one single
candidate architecture. To efficiently search the optimal embedding dimensions,
we design a uniform embedding dimension sampling scheme to equally train all
candidate architectures, meaning architecture-related parameters and learnable
thresholds are trained simultaneously in one supernet. We then propose an
evolution search method based on the supernet to find the optimal embedding
dimensions for each field. Experiments on public datasets show that OptEmbed
can learn a compact embedding table which can further improve the model
performance.

propagation rules. There are various propagation rules to construct classical
block codes. However, propagation rules have not been extensively explored for
constructions of locally repairable codes. In this paper, we introduce a few
propagation rules to construct good locally repairable codes. To our surprise,
these simple propagation rules produce a few interesting results. Firstly, by
concatenating a locally repairable code as an inner code with a classical block
code as an outer code, we obtain quite a few dimension-optimal binary locally
repairable codes. Secondly, from this concatenation, we explicitly build a
family of locally repairable codes that exceeds the Zyablov-type bound.
Thirdly, by a lengthening propagation rule that adds some rows and columns from
a parity-check matrix of a given linear code, we are able to produce a family
of dimension-optimal binary locally repairable codes from the extended Hamming
codes, and to convert a classical maximum distance separable (MDS) code into a
Singleton-optimal locally repairable code. Furthermore, via the lengthening
propagation rule, we greatly simplify the construction of a family of locally
repairable codes in \cite[Theorem 5]{MX20} that breaks the asymptotic
Gilbert-Varshamov bound. In addition, we make use of three other propagation
rules to produce more dimension-optimal binary locally repairable codes.
Finally, one of phenomena that we observe in this paper is that some trivial
propagation rules in classical block codes do not hold anymore for locally
repairable codes.

and the underlying physics believed to be encapsulated by the region. This
paper aims to define the middle corona and give an overview of the processes
that occur there.

grasping algorithm to enhance the speed and robustness of pick-and-place tasks.
The system consists of two manipulators that use quasi-direct-drive actuation
to provide highly transparent force feedback. The end-effector has bimodal
force sensors that measure 3-axis force information and 2-dimensional contact
location. This information is used for anti-slip and re-grasping reflexes. When
the user makes contact with the desired object, the re-grasping reflex aligns
the gripper fingers with antipodal points on the object to maximize the grasp
stability. The reflex takes only 150ms to correct for inaccurate grasps chosen
by the user, so the user's motion is only minimally disturbed by the execution
of the re-grasp. Once antipodal contact is established, the anti-slip reflex
ensures that the gripper applies enough normal force to prevent the object from
slipping out of the grasp. The combination of proprioceptive manipulators and
reflexive grasping allows the user to complete teleoperated tasks with
precision at high speed.

and takes humanity a step back in societal progress. HateXplain is a recently
published and first dataset to use annotated spans in the form of rationales,
along with speech classification categories and targeted communities to make
the classification more humanlike, explainable, accurate and less biased. We
tune BERT to perform this task in the form of rationales and class prediction,
and compare our performance on different metrics spanning across accuracy,
explainability and bias. Our novelty is threefold. Firstly, we experiment with
the amalgamated rationale class loss with different importance values.
Secondly, we experiment extensively with the ground truth attention values for
the rationales. With the introduction of conservative and lenient attentions,
we compare performance of the model on HateXplain and test our hypothesis.
Thirdly, in order to improve the unintended bias in our models, we use masking
of the target community words and note the improvement in bias and
explainability metrics. Overall, we are successful in achieving model
explanability, bias removal and several incremental improvements on the
original BERT implementation.

avenues for detecting vaccine stance. Therefore, this paper aims to (1) study
the importance of integrating online and offline data to vaccine stance
detection; and (2) identify the critical online and offline attributes that

As it
focuses on visual information to model the speech, its performance is
inherently sensitive to personal lip appearances and movements. This makes the
lip reading models show degraded performance when they are applied to unseen
speakers due to the mismatch between training and testing conditions. Speaker
adaptation technique aims to reduce this mismatch between train and test
speakers, thus guiding a trained model to focus on modeling the speech content
without being intervened by the speaker variations. In contrast to the efforts
made in audio-based speech recognition for decades, the speaker adaptation
methods have not well been studied in lip reading. In this paper, to remedy the
performance degradation of lip reading model on unseen speakers, we propose a
speaker-adaptive lip reading method, namely user-dependent padding. The
user-dependent padding is a speaker-specific input that can participate in the
visual feature extraction stage of a pre-trained lip reading model. Therefore,
the lip appearances and movements information of different speakers can be
considered during the visual feature encoding, adaptively for individual
speakers. Moreover, the proposed method does not need 1) any additional layers,
2) to modify the learned weights of the pre-trained model, and 3) the speaker
label of train data used during pre-train. It can directly adapt to unseen
speakers by learning the user-dependent padding only, in a supervised or
unsupervised manner. Finally, to alleviate the speaker information
insufficiency in public lip reading databases, we label the speaker of a
well-known audio-visual database, LRW, and design an unseen-speaker lip reading
scenario named LRW-ID.

generate the graph matching pairs. Then, based on the assignment matrix, we can
align the feature distributions between the two domains with the graph-based

capabilities via a capability transfer function that characterizes the payoff
of each player at equilibrium given capabilities for all players in the game.
In this paper, we model a player's capability as the size of the strategy space
available to that player. We analyze a mixed capability variant of the Gold and
Mines Game recently proposed by Yang et al. and derive its capability transfer
function in closed form.

quality of images, producing high-fidelity ones. Also, quite recently, there
are architecture designs, which enable GAN to unsupervisedly learn the semantic
attributes represented in different layers. However, there is still a lack of
research on generating face images more consistent with human aesthetics. Based
on EigenGAN [He et al., ICCV 2021], we build the techniques of reinforcement
learning into the generator of EigenGAN. The agent tries to figure out how to
alter the semantic attributes of the generated human faces towards more
preferable ones. To accomplish this, we trained an aesthetics scoring model
that can conduct facial beauty prediction. We also can utilize this scoring
model to analyze the correlation between face attributes and aesthetics scores.
Empirically, using off-the-shelf techniques from reinforcement learning would
not work well. So instead, we present a new variant incorporating the
ingredients emerging in the reinforcement learning communities in recent years.
Compared to the original generated images, the adjusted ones show clear
distinctions concerning various attributes. Experimental results using the
MindSpore, show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Altered facial images
are commonly more attractive, with significantly improved aesthetic levels.

component of logarithmic gauged linear sigma models (log GLSM). A punctured
R-map is a punctured map in the sense of ACGS, further twisted by the sheaf of
differentials on the domain curve. They admit two different but closely related
perfect obstruction theories - a canonical one and a reduced one. While the
canonical theory leads to generalized double ramification cycles with targets
and spin structures, without expansions, the reduced theory describes boundary
contributions in log GLSM.
  Major results of this paper include a sequence of axioms in both canonical
and reduced theories:
  1. A product formula computing disconnected invariants in terms of connected
ones
  2. Fundamental class axioms, string and divisor equations
  As an important application, these formulas lead to a class of invariants in
the reduced theory, called effective invariants. They are at the heart of
recent advances in GW theory, and will be shown to give rise to explicit
correction terms to the quantum Lefschetz principle in higher genus GW theory
for arbitrary smooth complete intersections in a forthcoming paper.
  For quintic 3-folds, we show that all effective invariants are determined by
$[(2g-2)/5] + 1$ many basic effective invariants, using the formulas in (1) and
(2). This matches the number of free parameters of the famous BCOV B-model
theory in physics. Similar results apply to other complete intersections. This,
together with the joint works of the last two authors and S. Guo on the genus
two mirror theorem and the higher genus mirror conjectures for quintic 3-folds,
shows that log GLSM is an effective tool for proving BCOV-type conjectures in
higher genus GW theory.
  Further applications of punctured R-maps include an LG/CY correspondence for
effective invariants and a relation to the locus of holomorphic differentials.

importance in biomedical fields. Among different types of data used to answer
this biological question, studies based on T cell receptors (TCRs) are under
recent spotlight due to the growing appreciation of the roles of the host
immunity system in tumor biology. However, the one-to-many correspondence
between a patient and multiple TCR sequences hinders researchers from simply
adopting classical statistical/machine learning methods. There were recent
attempts to model this type of data in the context of multiple instance
learning (MIL).
  Despite the novel application of MIL to cancer detection using TCR sequences
and the demonstrated adequate performance in several tumor types, there is
still room for improvement, especially for certain cancer types. Furthermore,
explainable neural network models are not fully investigated for this
application.
  In this article, we propose multiple instance neural networks based on sparse
attention (MINN-SA) to enhance the performance in cancer detection and
explainability. The sparse attention structure drops out uninformative
instances in each bag, achieving both interpretability and better predictive
performance in combination with the skip connection.
  Our experiments show that MINN-SA yields the highest area under the ROC curve
(AUC) scores on average measured across 10 different types of cancers, compared
to existing MIL approaches. Moreover, we observe from the estimated attentions
that MINN-SA can identify the TCRs that are specific for tumor antigens in the

the position of a random walker whose moves are dictated by the measurement

direct growth of a heterostructure of two different materials constrains the
available band offsets, and it is still unclear if large built-in potentials
are attainable for 2D materials. The electronic properties of atomically thin
semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are not static, and
their exciton binding energy and quasiparticle band gap depend strongly on the
proximal environment. Recent studies have shown that this effect can be
harnessed to engineer the lateral band profile of monolayer TMDs to create a
heterojunction. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of a nanoscale lateral
heterojunction in monolayer MoSe2 by intercalating Se at the interface of a
hBN/Ru(0001) substrate. The Se intercalation creates a spatially abrupt
modulation of the local hBN/Ru work function, which is imprinted directly onto
an overlying MoSe2 monolayer to create a large built-in potential of 0.83 eV.
We spatially resolve the MoSe2 band profile and work function using scanning
tunneling spectroscopy to map out the nanoscale depletion region. The Se
intercalation also modifies the dielectric environment, influencing the local
band gap renormalization and increasing the MoSe2 band gap by ~0.26 eV. This
work illustrates that environmental proximity engineering provides a robust
method to indirectly manipulate the band profile of 2D materials outside the
limits of their intrinsic properties, providing avenues for future device
design.

collide with an inductive probe placed in the flow, which serves both as the
obstacle that generates the magnetized bow shock, and as a diagnostic of the
advected magnetic field. Laser interferometry along two orthogonal lines of
sight is used to measure the line-integrated electron density. A detached bow
shock forms ahead of the probe, with a larger opening angle in the plane
parallel to the magnetic field than in the plane normal to it. Since the
resistive diffusion length of the plasma is comparable to the probe size, the
magnetic field decouples from the ion fluid at the shock front and generates a
hydrodynamic shock, whose structure is determined by the sonic Mach number,
rather than the magnetosonic Mach number of the flow. 3D simulations performed
using the resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code GORGON confirm this picture,
but under-predict the anisotropy observed in the shape of the experimental bow

its simplicity and practicality. However, due to its high sensitivity
parameters, the accuracy of the clustering result depends heavily on practical
experience. In this paper, we first propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning
guided automatic DBSCAN parameters search framework, namely DRL-DBSCAN. The
framework models the process of adjusting the parameter search direction by
perceiving the clustering environment as a Markov decision process, which aims
to find the best clustering parameters without manual assistance. DRL-DBSCAN
learns the optimal clustering parameter search policy for different feature
distributions via interacting with the clusters, using a weakly-supervised
reward training policy network. In addition, we also present a recursive search
mechanism driven by the scale of the data to efficiently and controllably
process large parameter spaces. Extensive experiments are conducted on five
artificial and real-world datasets based on the proposed four working modes.
The results of offline and online tasks show that the DRL-DBSCAN not only
consistently improves DBSCAN clustering accuracy by up to 26% and 25%
respectively, but also can stably find the dominant parameters with high
computational efficiency. The code is available at

proper range of the averaging time to realize a high success probability is
obtained by developing a binomial-coherent-state model, which describes the

relate stellar radiation field to gas surface density, and vary the dust-to-gas

between the surface density of star formation rate ($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$) or
dust mass ($\Sigma_\mathrm{dust}$) and $T_\mathrm{dust}$. We show that the high
$T_\mathrm{dust}$ observed at $z\gtrsim 5$ favour low dust-to-gas ratios

an alternative explanation for the high $T_\mathrm{dust}$. The dust
temperatures are similar between the two (RT and one-$T$) models as long as we

impact on meeting learning objectives and program dropout risks. Developing
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for automatic SE measurement requires
annotated datasets. However, existing SE datasets suffer from inconsistent
definitions and annotation protocols mostly unaligned with the definition of SE
in educational psychology. This issue could be misleading in developing
generalizable AI models and make it hard to compare the performance of these
models developed on different datasets. The objective of this critical review
was to explore the existing SE datasets and highlight inconsistencies in terms
of differing engagement definitions and annotation protocols. Methods: Several
academic databases were searched for publications introducing new SE datasets.
The datasets containing students' single- or multi-modal data in online or
offline computer-based virtual learning sessions were included. The definition
and annotation of SE in the existing datasets were analyzed based on our
defined seven dimensions of engagement annotation: sources, data modalities,
timing, temporal resolution, level of abstraction, combination, and
quantification. Results: Thirty SE measurement datasets met the inclusion
criteria. The reviewed SE datasets used very diverse and inconsistent
definitions and annotation protocols. Unexpectedly, very few of the reviewed
datasets used existing psychometrically validated scales in their definition of
SE. Discussion: The inconsistent definition and annotation of SE are
problematic for research on developing comparable AI models for automatic SE
measurement. Some of the existing SE definitions and protocols in settings
other than virtual learning that have the potential to be used in virtual

self-driving vehicles in terms of scalability. Existing methods mostly rely on
heuristic-based simulation, where traffic participants follow certain
human-encoded rules that fail to generate complex human behaviors. Therefore,
the reactive simulation concept is proposed to bridge the human behavior gap
between simulation and real-world traffic scenarios by leveraging real-world
data. However, these reactive models can easily generate unreasonable behaviors
after a few steps of simulation, where we regard the model as losing its
stability. To the best of our knowledge, no work has explicitly discussed and
analyzed the stability of the reactive simulation framework. In this paper, we
aim to provide a thorough stability analysis of the reactive simulation and
propose a solution to enhance the stability. Specifically, we first propose a
new reactive simulation framework, where we discover that the smoothness and
consistency of the simulated state sequences are crucial factors to stability.
We then incorporate the kinematic vehicle model into the framework to improve
the closed-loop stability of the reactive simulation. Furthermore, along with
commonly-used metrics, several novel metrics are proposed in this paper to
better analyze the simulation performance.

billions of users every day. The mainstream RS ranking framework is composed of
two parts: a Multi-Task Learning model (MTL) that predicts various user
feedback, i.e., clicks, likes, sharings, and a Multi-Task Fusion model (MTF)
that combines the multi-task outputs into one final ranking score with respect
to user satisfaction. There has not been much research on the fusion model
while it has great impact on the final recommendation as the last crucial
process of the ranking. To optimize long-term user satisfaction rather than
obtain instant returns greedily, we formulate MTF task as Markov Decision
Process (MDP) within a recommendation session and propose a Batch Reinforcement
Learning (RL) based Multi-Task Fusion framework (BatchRL-MTF) that includes a
Batch RL framework and an online exploration. The former exploits Batch RL to
learn an optimal recommendation policy from the fixed batch data offline for
long-term user satisfaction, while the latter explores potential high-value
actions online to break through the local optimal dilemma. With a comprehensive
investigation on user behaviors, we model the user satisfaction reward with
subtle heuristics from two aspects of user stickiness and user activeness.
Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a billion-sample level real-world
dataset to show the effectiveness of our model. We propose a conservative
offline policy estimator (Conservative-OPEstimator) to test our model offline.
Furthermore, we take online experiments in a real recommendation environment to
compare performance of different models. As one of few Batch RL researches
applied in MTF task successfully, our model has also been deployed on a
large-scale industrial short video platform, serving hundreds of millions of
users.

structure, and the hybridization between Ni-$3d$, O-$2p$, and Nd-$5d$ orbitals.
For simplicity and stimulated by the recent electronic structure calculations,
the latter are formally replaced with symmetric orbitals centered at the
missing O sites in the Nd layer, forming a two-dimensional (2D) band strongly
hybridizing with the Ni-$3d^9_{z^2}$ state. This hybridization pushes the main
part of the $3d^9_{z^2}$ spectral function up in energy by several eV and
stabilizes the singlet with considerable $d^9_{z^2}$ and other configurational
components. For the parent compound, we find that states of Ni-$3d^9_{z^2}$
character spread over a large energy range in the spectra, and cannot and
should not be represented by a single orbital energy, as suggested in other
approximations. This is qualitatively consistent with the RIXS measurements
showing a broad distribution of the Ni-$3d^9_{z^2}$ hole state, although the
shape of the Ni-$3d^9_{z^2}$ related structure is much more complicated
requiring reinterpretations of the RIXS data. For the hole-doped systems, we
show that adding these additional ingredients can still result in the
lowest-energy hole doped state having a singlet character.

ridership in these systems has often failed to reach targeted levels. FLM

shifts to other means of transport. Effective FLM options are required to
prevent this phenomenon and make public transport attractive for commuters. One
possible solution is to forge partnerships between public transport and FLM

prudent allocation of supply and optimised strategies for FLM operations and

missing value is never followed by an observed measurement, this leads to
dropout pattern. The missing values could be in the response variable, the
covariates or in both. The missingness mechanism is termed non-random when the
probability of missingness depends on the missing value and may be on the
observed values. In this case the missing values should be considered in the
analysis to avoid any potential bias. The aim of this article is to employ
multiple imputations (MI) to handle missing values in covariates using. The
selection model is used to model longitudinal data in the presence of
non-random dropout. The stochastic EM algorithm (SEM) is developed to obtain
the model parameter estimates in addition to the estimates of the dropout
model. The SEM algorithm does not provide standard errors of the estimates. We
developed a Monte Carlo method to obtain the standard errors. The proposed
approach performance is evaluated through a simulation study. Also, the
proposed approach is applied to a real data set.

two graphs, arises in various graph-related tasks. Recent learning-based
methods lack interpretability, as they directly transform interaction
information between two graphs into one hidden vector and then map it to
similarity. To cope with this problem, this study proposes a more interpretable
end-to-end paradigm for graph similarity learning, named Similarity Computation
via Maximum Common Subgraph Inference (INFMCS). Our critical insight into
INFMCS is the strong correlation between similarity score and Maximum Common
Subgraph (MCS). We implicitly infer MCS to obtain the normalized MCS size, with
the supervision information being only the similarity score during training. To
capture more global information, we also stack some vanilla transformer encoder
layers with graph convolution layers and propose a novel permutation-invariant
node Positional Encoding. The entire model is quite simple yet effective.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that INFMCS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines for graph-graph classification and regression tasks.
Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed computation
paradigm and other components. Also, visualization and statistics of results
reveal the interpretability of INFMCS.

Nonetheless, a beam with a highly-peaked transverse spatial profile can achieve
a higher fraction of the total beam charge in the core. The same effect can be
seen when the witness beam's transverse momentum profile has a peaked

methods require a well pre-trained model to provide useful supporting
parameters, such as C1-norm, BatchNorm value and gradient information, which
may lead to inconsistency of filter evaluation if the parameters of the
pre-trained model are not well optimized. Therefore, we propose a sensitiveness
based method to evaluate the importance of each layer from the perspective of
inference accuracy by adding extra damage for the original model. Because the
performance of the accuracy is determined by the distribution of parameters
across all layers rather than individual parameter, the sensitiveness based
method will be robust to update of parameters. Namely, we can obtain similar
importance evaluation of each convolutional layer between the imperfect-trained
and fully trained models. For VGG-16 on CIFAR-10, even when the original model
is only trained with 50 epochs, we can get same evaluation of layer importance
as the results when the model is trained fully. Then we will remove filters
proportional from each layer by the quantified sensitiveness. Our sensitiveness
based pruning framework is verified efficiently on VGG-16, a customized Conv-4

other than the spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM can give rise to the same type of
scale factor evolution. Firstly, we elaborate on what we exactly imply by a
$\Lambda$CDM-like evolution or kinematic/cosmographic degeneracy with the
$\Lambda$CDM model, using the lessons from the statefinder diagnostic. Then, we
consider two models with interaction in the dark sector: coupled fluid-fluid
model and coupled quintessence model. We enforce the \emph{kinematic}
degeneracy with the spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM model via the cosmographic
condition $j=1$ ($j$ being the jerk parameter), which in turn fixes the
function of the interaction term that is a priori unspecified. We argue that in
General Relativity this cosmographic condition is consistent only with spatial
flatness. Employing a dynamical system approach, we show that the spatially
flat coupled fluid-fluid interacting models kinematically degenerate with
$\Lambda$CDM must necessarily be based on a phantom fluid, whereas the set of
physically viable spatially flat coupled quintessence models with power law or
exponential potential kinematically degenerate to $\Lambda$CDM is of measure
zero. Our analysis establishes that coupled fluid-fluid models with non-phantom
fluids or coupled quintessence models with power law and exponential potential
can never reproduce a cosmological evolution similar to that of the
$\Lambda$CDM. The astrophysical consequences of our findings are qualitatively
discussed in light of observational cosmological tensions.

film post-production. However, they often introduce artefacts in motions, which
can be detrimental to the perceived realism. In particular, footskating is a
frequent and disturbing artefact requiring foot contacts knowledge to be
cleaned up. Current approaches to obtain foot contact labels rely either on
unreliable threshold-based heuristics or on tedious manual annotation. In this
article, we address foot contact label detection from motion with a deep
learning. To this end, we first publicly release UnderPressure, a novel motion
capture database labelled with pressure insoles data serving as reliable
knowledge of foot contact with the ground. Then, we design and train a deep
neural network to estimate ground reaction forces exerted on the feet from
motion data and then derive accurate foot contact labels. The evaluation of our
model shows that we significantly outperform heuristic approaches based on
height and velocity thresholds and that our approach is much more robust on
motion sequences suffering from perturbations like noise or footskate. We
further propose a fully automatic workflow for footskate cleanup: foot contact
labels are first derived from estimated ground reaction forces. Then, footskate
is removed by solving foot constraints through an optimisation-based inverse
kinematics (IK) approach that ensures consistency with the estimated ground
reaction forces. Beyond footskate cleanup, both the database and the method we
propose could help to improve many approaches based on foot contact labels or
ground reaction forces, including inverse dynamics problems like motion
reconstruction and learning of deep motion models in motion synthesis or
character animation. Our implementation, pre-trained model as well as links to

  Sequential Recommendation",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Recent sequential recommendation models rely increasingly on consecutive
short-term user-item interaction sequences to model user interests. These
approaches have, however, raised concerns about both short- and long-term
interests. (1) {\it short-term}: interaction sequences may not result from a
monolithic interest, but rather from several intertwined interests, even within
a short period of time, resulting in their failures to model skip behaviors;
(2) {\it long-term}: interaction sequences are primarily observed sparsely at
discrete intervals, other than consecutively over the long run. This renders
difficulty in inferring long-term interests, since only discrete interest
representations can be derived, without taking into account interest dynamics
across sequences. In this study, we address these concerns by learning (1)
multi-scale representations of short-term interests; and (2) dynamics-aware
representations of long-term interests. To this end, we present an
\textbf{I}nterest \textbf{D}ynamics modeling framework using generative
\textbf{N}eural \textbf{P}rocesses, coined IDNP, to model user interests from a
functional perspective. IDNP learns a global interest function family to define
each user's long-term interest as a function instantiation, manifesting
interest dynamics through function continuity. Specifically, IDNP first encodes
each user's short-term interactions into multi-scale representations, which are
then summarized as user context. By combining latent global interest with user
context, IDNP then reconstructs long-term user interest functions and predicts
interactions at upcoming query timestep. Moreover, IDNP can model such interest
functions even when interaction sequences are limited and non-consecutive.
Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our model
outperforms state-of-the-arts on various evaluation metrics.

thought to be the first massive galaxies that formed in the Universe. First
found at $z \sim 3$, they are even less abundant at lower redshifts, and it is
believed that with time they mostly transformed through mergers into today's
giant ellipticals. Those red nuggets which managed to escape this fate can
serve as unique laboratories to study the early evolution of massive galaxies.
In this paper, we aim to make use of the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift
Survey to build the largest up-to-date catalogue of spectroscopically confirmed
red nuggets at the intermediate redshift $0.5<z<1.0$. Starting from a catalogue
of nearly 90 000 VIPERS galaxies we select sources with stellar masses
$M_{star} > 8\times10^{10}$ $\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and effective radii
$R_\mathrm{e}<1.5$ kpc. Among them, we select red, passive galaxies with old
stellar population based on colour--colour NUVrK diagram, star formation rate
values, and verification of their optical spectra. Verifying the influence of
the limit of the source compactness on the selection, we found that the sample
size can vary even up to two orders of magnitude, depending on the chosen
criterion. Using one of the most restrictive criteria with additional checks on
their spectra and passiveness, we spectroscopically identified only 77
previously unknown red nuggets. The resultant catalogue of 77 red nuggets is
the largest such catalogue built based on the uniform set of selection criteria
above the local Universe. Number density calculated on the final sample of 77
VIPERS passive red nuggets per comoving Mpc$^3$ increases from
4.7$\times10^{-6}$ at $z \sim 0.61$ to $9.8 \times 10^{-6}$ at $z \sim 0.95$,
which is higher than values estimated in the local Universe, and lower than the
ones found at $z>2$. It fills the gap at intermediate redshift.

such tangle-prone GMs is the presence of protrusions extending out from the

the field and analysis in laboratory. Moreover, they are time consuming and
only allow monitoring sub-sections of the crop field. This leads to a lack of
accuracy on the condition of the crop as a whole due to intra-field
heterogeneities. Multispectral imagery by UAV allows uniform scan of fields and
better capture of crop maturity information. On the other hand, deep learning
methods have shown tremendous potential in estimating agronomic parameters,
especially maturity. However, they require large labeled datasets. Although
large sets of aerial images are available, labeling them with ground truth is a
tedious, if not impossible task. In this paper, we propose a method for

frequencies from sub-6GHz to THz bands, the mmWave cellular MEC network is more
energy efficient than UAV's onborad processing for a broader range of network

to the model not exploiting the labeled data reliably and drastically degrade
the performance of SSL methods, which could not be rescued by the traditional

general models for their detection and analysis are missing. In this work, we
aim to fill this gap by proposing a probabilistic generative model that
explains social media footprints -- i.e., social network structure and
propagations of information -- through a set of latent communities,
characterized by a degree of echo-chamber behavior and by an opinion polarity.
Specifically, echo chambers are modeled as communities that are permeable to
pieces of information with similar ideological polarity, and impermeable to
information of opposed leaning: this allows discriminating echo chambers from
communities that lack a clear ideological alignment.
  To learn the model parameters we propose a scalable, stochastic adaptation of
the Generalized Expectation Maximization algorithm, that optimizes the joint
likelihood of observing social connections and information propagation.
Experiments on synthetic data show that our algorithm is able to correctly
reconstruct ground-truth latent communities with their degree of echo-chamber
behavior and opinion polarity. Experiments on real-world data about polarized
social and political debates, such as the Brexit referendum or the COVID-19
vaccine campaign, confirm the effectiveness of our proposal in detecting echo
chambers. Finally, we show how our model can improve accuracy in auxiliary
predictive tasks, such as stance detection and prediction of future
propagations.

  This problem has been recently addressed for the well-known model of
communicating systems, that is sets of components consisting of finite-state
machines capable of exchanging messages. The main idea of this approach is to
take two systems, select a participant from each of them, and derive from those
participants a pair of coupled gateways connecting the two systems. More
precisely, a message directed to one of the gateways is forwarded to the
gateway in the other system, which sends it to the other system. It has been
shown that, under some suitable compatibility conditions between gateways, this
composition mechanism preserves deadlock freedom for asynchronous as well as
symmetric synchronous communications (where sender and receiver play the same
part in determining which message to exchange).
  This paper considers the case of asymmetric synchronous communications where
senders decide independently which message should be exchanged. We show here
that preservation of lock freedom requires sequentiality of gateways, while
this is not needed for preservation of either deadlock freedom or strong lock
freedom.

In this paper, using the data collected from phasor measurement units (PMUs),
two methods based on Fisher random matrix are proposed to detect faults in
power grids. Firstly, the fault detection matrix is constructed and the event
detection problem is reformatted as a two-sample covariance matrices test
problem. Secondly, the central limit theorem for the linear spectral statistic
of the Fisher matrix is derived and a test statistic for testing faults is
proposed. To save computing resources, the screening step of fault interval
based on the test statistic is designed to check the existence of faults. Then
two point-by-point methods are proposed to determine the time of the fault in
the interval. One method detects faults by checking whether the largest sample
eigenvalue falls outside the supporting set of limiting spectral distribution
of the standard Fisher matrix, which can detect the faults with higher
accuracy. The other method tests the faults based on the statistic proposed,
which has a faster detection speed. Compared with existing works, the
simulation results illustrate that two methods proposed in this paper cost less
computational time and provide a higher degree of accuracy.

promising and malignant melanoma incidence rates are relatively low. As a
result, datasets are heavily imbalanced which complicates training current
state-of-the-art supervised classification AI models. We propose to use
generative models to learn the benign data distribution and detect
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) malignant images through density estimation.
Normalizing Flows (NFs) are ideal candidates for OOD detection due to their
ability to compute exact likelihoods. Nevertheless, their inductive biases
towards apparent graphical features rather than semantic context hamper
accurate OOD detection. In this work, we aim at using these biases with
domain-level knowledge of melanoma, to improve likelihood-based OOD detection
of malignant images. Our encouraging results demonstrate potential for OOD
detection of melanoma using NFs. We achieve a 9% increase in Area Under Curve
of the Receiver Operating Characteristics by using wavelet-based NFs. This
model requires significantly less parameters for inference making it more
applicable on edge devices. The proposed methodology can aid medical experts
with diagnosis of skin-cancer patients and continuously increase survival
rates. Furthermore, this research paves the way for other areas in oncology
with similar data imbalance issues.

The range of flow scales is fairly broad in shallow layers and narrows as the

supergranulation to giant-cell values, and indicate the existence of
large-scale convective motions in the near-surface shear layer. The results can
naturally be interpreted in terms of a superposition of differently scaled
flows localized in different depth intervals. There is some tendency toward the
emergence of meridionally elongated (banana-shaped) convection structures in
the deep layers. The total power of convective flows is anticorrelated with the
sunspot-number variation over the solar activity cycle in shallow subsurface
layers and positively correlated at larger depths, which is suggestive of the
depth redistribution of the convective-flow energy due to the action of

misleading depictions of the main effects. Instead, we propose a new graphic,
the survival area plot, to directly depict the survival probability over time

g-computation based on a suitable time-to-event model to obtain the relevant

not met, the proposed plot may still be used to depict noncausal associations.
We illustrate and compare the proposed graphics to simpler alternatives using

sputtering, which can be used for defect-mediated engineering of the properties
of the material. Ions can store energy in the form of kinetic and potential
energy (sum of the ionization energies) and transfer it to the solid upon
impact. The interaction and sputtering mechanisms depend significantly on the
projectile energies. However, the relevance of various interaction mechanisms
is unknown. Here we show that for slow HCI (5 keV) the interaction mechanisms
leading to particle emission by electronic excitation and transferred kinetic
energy are independent from each other, which is consistent with our atomistic
simulations. We have irradiated substrate supported (Au, SiO$_2$) monolayers of
MoS$_2$ with highly charged xenon ions (charge state: 17$+$ - 40$+$), extracted
the emitted neutral, post-ionized Mo particles into a time-of-flight mass
spectrometer and determined their velocity distributions. We find two main
contributions, one at high velocities and a second one at lower velocities, and
assign them to kinetic and potential effects respectively. Our data suggests
that the dominant mechanism for potential sputtering is related to
electron-phonon coupling, while non-thermal processes play no significant role.
We anticipate that our work will be a starting point for further experiments

standing and fundamental problem. Recently, a new generation of quantum
simulation experiments based on atoms in optical lattices has emerged that
gives unprecedented insights into the detailed spatial and temporal dynamics of
this problem, which compliments earlier results from condensed matter
experiments. Focusing on observables accessible in these new experiments, we
explore here the equilibrium as well as non-equilibrium dynamics of a mobile
hole in two coupled antiferromagnetic spin lattices. Using a self-consistent
Born approximation, we calculate the spectral properties of the hole in the
bilayer and extract the energy bands of the quasiparticles, corresponding to
magnetic polarons that are either symmetric or anti-symmetric under layer
exchange. These two kinds of polarons are degenerate at certain momenta due to
the antiferromagnetic symmetry, and we, furthermore, examine how the momentum
of the ground state polaron depends on the interlayer coupling strength. The
long time dynamics of a hole initially created in one layer is shown to be
characterised by oscillations between the two layers with a frequency given by
the energy difference between the symmetric and the anti-symmetric polaron. We
finally demonstrate that the expansion velocity of a hole initially created at
a given lattice site is governed by the ballistic motion of polarons. It
moreover depends non-monotonically on the interlayer coupling, eventually
increasing as a quantum phase transition to a disordered state is approached.

First, the knowledge of human experts is entered and designed as a decision
tree. In the second step, an expert system is designed based on the provided
rules of the generated decision tree. In the third step, an algorithm is
proposed to weight the results of the tree based on the quality of the experts.
To improve the performance of the expert system, a majority voting algorithm is
developed as a post-process step to select the qualified trainer who satisfies
the most expert decision tree for each course. The quality of the proposed
expert system is evaluated using real data from Iranian universities. The
calculated accuracy rate is 85.55, demonstrating the robustness and accuracy of
the proposed system. The proposed system has little computational complexity

It is important that the decoder can keep pace with the quantum clock speed,

corrections to reduce the amount of syndrome data sent to a standard matching
decoder. We study these classical overheads for the surface code under a
phenomenological phase-flip noise model with imperfect measurements. We find
substantial improvements in the runtime of the global decoder and the

logical failure probability of $f = 10^{-15}$ using qubits with physical error
rate $p = 10^{-3}$ and a distance $d=22$ code, we find that the bandwidth cost
is reduced by a factor of $1000$, and the time taken by a matching decoder is
sped up by a factor of $200$. To achieve this target failure probability, the
pre-decoding approach requires a $50\%$ increase in the qubit count compared

an online learning-based method. When quality enhancement is demanded, we
online train our proposed model at encoder side and then use the parameters to
update the model of decoder side. This method not only improves model
performance, but also makes one model adoptable to multiple coding scenarios.
Besides, quantization error in discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients is
the root cause of various HEVC compression artifacts. Thus, we combine
frequency domain priors to assist image reconstruction. We design a DCT based
convolution layer, to produce DCT coefficients that are suitable for CNN

defects, and electrostatic doping effectively control the decay dynamics but
significantly disturb the intrinsic properties of TMDCs, such as electron band
structure and exciton binding energy. Meanwhile, vacuum-field manipulation
provides an optical alternative for engineering radiative decay dynamics.
Planar mirrors and cavities have been employed to manage the light-matter
interactions of two-dimensional excitons. However, the conventional flat
platforms cannot customise the radiative decay landscape in the horizontal TMDC
plane or independently control vacuum field interference at different pumping

with more optical freedom. For neutral excitons of the monolayer MoSe2, the
meta-mirror manipulated the radiative decay rate by two orders of magnitude,
depending on its geometry. Moreover, we experimentally identified the
correlation between emission intensity and spectral linewidth. The anisotropic

in applications such as sentiment analysis. But NLP models are vulnerable to
the threat of pirated redistribution, damaging the economic interests of model
owners. Digital watermarking technology is an effective means to protect the
intellectual property rights of NLP model. The existing NLP model protection
mainly designs watermarking schemes by improving both security and robustness
purposes, however, the security and robustness of these schemes have the
following problems, respectively: (1) Watermarks are difficult to defend
against fraudulent declaration by adversary and are easily detected and blocked
from verification by human or anomaly detector during the verification process.
(2) The watermarking model cannot meet multiple robustness requirements at the
same time. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a novel
watermarking framework for NLP model based on the over-parameterization of
depth model and the multi-task learning theory. Specifically, a covert trigger
set is established to realize the perception-free verification of the
watermarking model, and a novel auxiliary network is designed to improve the
robustness and security of the watermarking model. The proposed framework was
evaluated on two benchmark datasets and three mainstream NLP models, and the
results show that the framework can successfully validate model ownership with
100% validation accuracy and advanced robustness and security without
compromising the host model performance.

and chiral states of superconducting topological insulators (STIs), such as
$M_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ ($M=$ Cu, Sr, Nb). The interplay of superconducting gap
symmetry, the orbital degrees of freedom, and strong spin-orbit interaction
generates a variety of odd-frequency pairs in the bulk and surface of STIs. The
nematic and chiral states are the prototypes of topological superconductors
with and without time-reversal symmetry, respectively. We find that the Fermi
surface evolution from a closed spheroidal to an open cylindrical shape gives
rise to the evolution of the emergent odd-frequency pairs and surface Andreev
bound states (SABSs). In addition, spin polarization of odd-frequency pairs and
SABSs stems from the non-unitary pairing in the chiral state. These evolution
and spin polarization of odd-frequency pairs and SABSs can be captured by
tunnel conductance spectroscopy. Furthermore, we study the anomalous proximity
effect in various irreducible representations of STIs. The anomalous proximity
effect is originally predicted in spin-triplet superconductor junctions without
spin-orbit interaction; Odd-frequency spin-triplet $s$-wave pairs penetrate
into diffusive normal metals (DN) and induce a pronounced zero-energy peak of
the local density of states in the DN region. Here we demonstrate that contrary
to the well-known results, the anomalous proximity effect in STIs is not immune
to nonmagnetic impurities. The fragility is attributed to the fact that the
proximitized odd-frequency even-parity pairs are admixtures of $s$-wave and
non-$s$-wave pairs due to strong spin-orbit interaction inherent to the parent
materials.

that the discontinuities/edges of the image lie in the zero level set of a

two-fold Hankel matrix. In addition, since the singular value decomposition of
a low-rank Hankel matrix corresponds to an adaptive tight frame system which
can represent the image with sparse canonical coefficients, our approach
consists of the following two stages. The first stage learns the tight wavelet
frame system from a given measurement, and the second stage restores the image
via the analysis approach based sparse regularization. The numerical results
are presented to demonstrate that the proposed approach is compared favorably
against several popular discrete regularization approaches and structured

of another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the
quality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a
novel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in
imaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require
long computation time for solving different optimization functions, their
performance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in
nowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based
depth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The
proposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in
the image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are
then used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.
Since edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,
they are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative
adversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,
the estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to
assist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental
results show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior
performance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the
state-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed

($F_\nu \propto \nu^{\alpha}$) of the candidate, $\alpha = - 1.22 \pm 0.33$, is
in agreement with an expected value derived from the standard diffusive shock

However, the TiO volume mixing ratio upper limit (10$^{-7.6}$ at 99\%

non-detection of Ti\,\textsc{i}, points to sequestration of Ti species,

TLSRec employs a hierarchical self-attention network to learn users' preference

examined for a model distribution of soliton amplitudes according to a power
law. $N$-soliton solutions ($N \le 50$) are constructed with the help of a
numerical procedure using the Darboux transformation and 100-digits arithmetic.
It is shown that there exist qualitatively different patterns of evolving
multisoliton solutions depending on the amplitude distribution. Collisions of a
large number of solitons lead to the decrease of values of statistical moments
(the orders from 3 to 7 have been considered). The statistical moments are
shown to exhibit long intervals of quasi-stationary behavior in the case of a
sufficiently large number of interacting solitons with close amplitudes. These
intervals can be characterized by the maximum value of the soliton gas density
and by ``smoothing'' of the wave fields in integral sense. The analytical
estimates describing these degenerate states of interacting solitons are
obtained.

modeling in practice, namely the complexity of ML, the interdisciplinary
approach in industry, and the need for ML interpretability. In this work, we
introduce an augmented reality-based system for collaborative immersive
analytics that is designed to support ML modeling in interdisciplinary teams.
We conduct a user study to examine how collaboration unfolds when users with
different professional backgrounds and levels of ML knowledge interact in
solving different ML tasks. Specifically, we use the pair analytics methodology
and performance assessments to assess collaboration and explore their
interactions with each other and the system. Based on this, we provide
qualitative and quantitative results on both teamwork and taskwork during
collaboration. Our results show how our system elicits sustained collaboration
as measured along six distinct dimensions. We finally make recommendations how
immersive systems should be designed to elicit sustained collaboration in ML
modeling.

variational modeling induces stochasticity on PRECODE's and its subsequent

purposefully omitting those stochastic gradients during attack optimization, we
formulate an attack that can disable PRECODE's privacy preserving effects. To
ensure privacy preservation against such targeted attacks, we propose PRECODE

a sensitive, fast and repeatable response. Therefore, various readout circuits
have been developed to improve the performance of ISFETs, especially to
eliminate the temperature effect. This paper presents a new approach for a
temperature-independent readout circuit that uses the threshold voltage
differences of an ISFET-MOSFET pair. The Linear Technology Simulation Program

performance based on the proposed readout circuit characteristics. A
macro-model is used to model ISFET behavior, including the first-level Spice
model for the MOSFET part and Verilog-A to model the surface potential,
reference electrode, and electrolyte of the ISFET to determine the
relationships between variables.In this way, the behavior of the ISFET is
monitored by the output voltage of the readout circuit based on a change in the
electrolyte's hydrogen potential (pH), determined by the simulation. The
proposed readout circuit has a temperature coefficient of 11.9 $ppm/{\deg}C$

between GC content, genome size and amino acid cost in thousands of
prokaryotes, together with new or recently compiled data on cell shape and
volume, duplication times, motility, nutrient assimilation, sporulation,
defense mechanisms and Gram staining. GC content integrates well with these
traits into r/K selection theory when phenotypic plasticity is considered. High
GC content prokaryotes are r-strategists with cheaper descendants thanks to a
lower average amino acid metabolic cost and a smaller cell volume, colonize
unstable environments thanks to flagella and a bacillus form and are
generalists in terms of resource opportunism and the ability to defend
themselves from various hazards. Low GC content prokaryotes are K-strategists
specialized for stable environments that maintain homeostasis via a high-cost
outer cell membrane and endospore formation as a response to nutrient
deprivation and attain a higher nutrient-to-biomass yield. The lower proteome
cost of high GC content prokaryotes is driven by the association between
GC-rich codons and cheaper amino acids in the genetic code, while the
correlation between GC content and genome size may be partly due to a shift in
the functional repertoire of genomes driven by r/K selection. In all, we show
that molecular diversity in the GC content of prokaryotes and the corresponding

three novel reaction types: the contact-inhibited, the contact-promoted, and
the spontaneous reactions. To the best of our knowledge, these reaction types
have not been taken into account in lattice-based stochastic simulations of
cell cultures. These new types of events may be easily applied to complicated
systems, enabling the generation of biologically feasible stochastic cell
culture simulations. Furthermore, we show that the exclusion algorithm and our
RRM algorithm are mathematically equivalent in the sense that the next reaction
to be realized and the corresponding sojourn time both belong to the same
reaction and time distributions in the two approaches -- even with the newly
introduced reaction types.
  Exact, agent-based, stochastic methods of cell culture simulations seem to be
undervalued and are mostly used as benchmarking tools to validate deterministic
approximations of the corresponding stochastic models. Our proposed methods are
exact, they are easy to implement, have a high predictive value, and can be
conveniently extended with new features. Therefore, these approaches promise a

delayed information, consisting of many clients (load balancers) and many

reinforcement learning algorithms to find an optimal load balancing solution.
Here, the discrete-time system model incorporates a synchronization delay under

all clients. We then provide theoretical performance guarantees for our

rank regression). The asymptotics of the estimator is usually derived under the
assumption of knowing the true rank. In this paper, we quantify the bias and
find the asymptotic distributions of the cointegration estimator in case of
misspecified rank. We find that the estimator is unbiased but has increased
variance when the rank is overestimated, whereas a bias is introduced for
underestimated rank, usually with a smaller variance. If the eigenvalues of a

the bias is small, and it might be preferable to an overestimated rank due to
the decreased variance. The results are illustrated on simulated data.

analysis method for finding activated brain areas in neuroimaging. However, the
method has several well-known issues. While powerful for finding brain regions
with some activation, the method as currently defined does not allow any
further quantification or localization of signal. In this paper we repair this
gap. We show that cluster-extent inference can be used (1.) to infer the
presence of signal in anatomical regions of interest and (2.) to quantify the
percentage of active voxels in any cluster or region of interest. These
additional inferences come for free, i.e. they do not require any further
adjustment of the alpha-level of tests, while retaining full familywise error
control. We achieve this extension of the possibilities of cluster inference by
an embedding of the method into a closed testing procedure, and solving the
graph-theoretic k-separator problem that results from this embedding. The new
method can be used in combination with random field theory or permutations. We
demonstrate the usefulness of the method in a large-scale application to

non-relativistic (NR) regime. Such a formal relationship is not any longer
valid within the relativistic domain. A new more general formal relationship,
that is valid within the relativistic framework is shown here, being developed
through the use of the LRESC model. The formalism of polarization propagators
is applied to write the different contributions to both properties within both
regimes, relativistic and NR. In the relativistic regime the Dirac-Coulomb
Hamiltonian was selected as the unperturbed Hamiltonian. Theoretical
developments together with results of calculations performed on the H$_2X_2$
series of molecules ($X =$ $^{17}$O, $^{33}$S, $^{77}$Se, $^{125}$Te and
$^{209}$Po) show that also within the relativistic regime there is a close
relationship between the parity-violation contributions to both properties. In
particular, spin-dependent contributions are the most important in the
four-component calculations of electroweak effects on the isotropic values of
both tensors, ${\bf \sigma}^{PV}$ and ${\bf M}^{PV}$, being also responsible
for the breakdown of the previously mentioned NR relationship among them. This
last relationship is still fulfilled when the scalar-relativistic effects are
considered.

properties dictate its function. Connectomics provides one avenue to predict
nervous system function. To test this explicitly, we systematically measure
signal propagation in 23,427 pairs of neurons across the head of the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans by direct optogenetic activation and simultaneous
whole-brain calcium imaging. We measure the sign (excitatory or inhibitory),
strength, temporal properties, and causal direction of signal propagation
between these neurons to create a functional atlas. We find that signal
propagation differs from predictions based on anatomy. Using mutants, we show
that extrasynaptic signaling not visible from anatomy contributes to this
difference. We identify many instances of dense-core-vesicle dependent
signaling on seconds-or-less timescales that evoke acute calcium transients
often where no direct wired connection exists but where relevant neuropeptides
and receptors are expressed. We propose that here extrasynaptically released
neuropeptides serve a similar function as that of classical neurotransmitters.
Finally, our measured signal propagation atlas better predicts neural dynamics
of spontaneous activity than does anatomy. We conclude that both synaptic and
extrasynaptic signaling drive neural dynamics on short timescales and that
measurement of evoked signal propagation are critical for interpreting neural

recent years. It is proposed that Phobos and Deimos may originate directly from
a splitting of an ancestral moon orbiting at around the Martian synchronous
orbit. At this hypothetical splitting, the apocenter of the inner moon
(presumed as Phobos) and the pericenter of the outer moon (presumed as Deimos)
are reported to coincide, in that, their semi-major axes reside inside and
outside the Martian synchronous orbit with non-zero eccentricities,
respectively. However, the successive orbital evolution of the two moons is not
studied. Here, we perform direct $N$-body orbital integrations of the moons,
including the Martian oblateness of the $J_2$ and $J_4$ terms. We show that the
two moons, while they precess, likely collide within $\sim 10^4$ years with an
impact velocity of $v_{\rm imp} \sim 100-300$ m s$^{-1}$ ($\sim 10-30$ times
moons' escape velocity) and with an isotropic impact direction. The impact
occurs around the apocenter and the pericenter of the inner and outer moons,
respectively, where the timescale of this periodic orbital alignment is
regulated by the precession. By performing additional impact simulations, we
show that such a high-velocity impact likely results in a disruptive outcome,
forming a debris ring at around the Martian synchronous orbit, from which
several small moons would accrete. Such an evolutionary path would eventually
form a different Martian moons system from the one we see today. Therefore, it
seems unlikely that Phobos and Deimos are split directly from a single
ancestral moon.

systematically summarize recent advances in machine learning which can be used

as antibiotic resistance and virulence, which are particularly important due to
the rising frequency of antimicrobial resistance. By designing a heritability
model incorporating realistic patterns of genome-wide linkage disequilibrium
for a frequently recombining bacterial pathogen, we test the performance of a
wide spectrum of different inference methods, including also GCTA. In addition
to the synthetic data benchmark, we present a comparison of the methods for
antibiotic resistance traits for multiple bacterial pathogens. Insights from
the benchmarking and real data analyses indicate a highly variable performance
of the different methods and suggest that heritability inference would likely
benefit from tailoring of the methods to the specific genetic architecture of

two-dimensional (2D) electron gas with anisotropic Rashba spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) to laser pulses. Through explicitly monitoring the time-dependent
photocurrents and spin polarization under different linear polarizations of the
laser pulse, we find that the transient breaking of the mirror symmetry in
combination with the anisotropy of the Rashba SOC results in significant
distinction between the charge-mediated and the spin-mediated contributions to
the photocurrents. Such distinction is obtained by analyzing the dependence of
the symmetry-breaking induced (transverse) components of the photocurrents on
the linear polarization angle of the laser pulse. This suggests a possibility
of inferring spin-mediated processes in photocurrents without the use of
circularly polarized lights. Moreover, the interplay between transient symmetry
breaking and the anisotropy of the Rashba SOC also leads to transiently nonzero
spin polarization components that are otherwise zero in the steady-state limit
and the linear response regime. Especially, the out-of-plane spin polarization
component can be induced or turned off by controlling the relative orientation
of the linear polarization with respect to the symmetry axis of the 2D
electronic system, without involving material-intrinsic magnetization effects.
Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of a particular coordination between the
polarization of the ultrafast laser pulses and the spatial symmetry of the
electronic materials in directing the real-time charge and the spin responses
that are fundamental to the development of ultrafast spintronics in solid
states.

  The paper shows that a generalization of the centralizer construction leads
to a new family $\{Y_{d,L}: L=1,2,3,\dots\}$ of Yangian-type algebras (the
Yangian $Y_d$ being the first term of this family). For the new algebras, the

two-fold: 1) The output LFs are separated from the decision parameters via
integrating a nonnegative mapping function into an SNL model; and 2) Stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) is adopted for implementing unconstrained model training
along with ensuring the output LFs nonnegativity. Empirical studies on four

evolving system dynamics has been a great challenge to the mainstream
reinforcement learning (RL). Mainly, the ever-changing system properties would
continuously affect how the RL agent interacts with the state space through its
actions, which effectively (re-)introduces concept drifts to the underlying
policy learning process. We postulated that higher adaptability for the control
policy can be achieved by characterizing and representing actions with extra
""degrees of freedom"" and thereby, with greater flexibility, adjusts to
variations from the action's ""behavioral"" outcomes, including how these actions
get carried out in real time and the shift in the action set itself. This paper
proposes a Bayesian-flavored generalized RL framework by first establishing the
notion of parametric action model to better cope with uncertainty and fluid
action behaviors, followed by introducing the notion of reinforcement field as
a physics-inspired construct established through ""polarized experience
particles"" maintained in the RL agent's working memory. These particles
effectively encode the agent's dynamic learning experience that evolves over
time in a self-organizing way. Using the reinforcement field as a substrate, we
will further generalize the policy search to incorporate high-level decision
concepts by viewing the past memory as an implicit graph structure, in which
the memory instances, or particles, are interconnected with their degrees of
associability/similarity defined and quantified such that the ""associative

Stephan's Quintet, observed as part of the Early Release Observations (ERO).
NGC7319 hosts a type 2 active galactic nucleus (AGN) and a low-power radio jet
(L_1.4GHz=3.3x10^22 W Hz^-1) with two asymmetric radio hotspots at 430 pc (N2)
and 1.5 kpc (S2) projected distances from the unresolved radio core. The MRS
data suggest that the molecular material in the disk of the galaxy decelerates
the jet and causes this length asymmetry. We find enhanced emission from warm
and hot H_2 (T_w=330+-40 K, T_h=900+-60 K) and ionized gas at the intersection
between the jet axis and dust lanes in the disk. This emission is coincident
with the radio hotspot N2, the hotspot closer to the core, suggesting that the
jet-interstellar medium (ISM) interaction decelerates the jet. Conversely, the
mid-infrared emission at the more distant hotspot is fainter, more highly
ionized, and with lower H_2 excitation, suggesting a more diffuse atomic
environment where the jet can progress to farther distances. At the N2 radio
hotspot, the ionized gas mass (M_ion=(2.4-12)x10^5 Msun) is comparable to that
of the warm H_2, but the former is more turbulent (sigma_ion~300 vs.
sigma_H2~150 km/s), so the mechanical energy of the ionized gas is ~1.3-10
times higher. From these estimates, we find that only <1% of the jet energy
remains as mechanical energy in these two ISM phases at N2. We also find
extended (r>0.3-1.5 kpc) high-ionization emission ([MgV], [NeVI], and [NeV])
close to the radio hotspots. This initial analysis of NGC7319 shows the
potential of MIRI/MRS to investigate the AGN feedback mechanisms due to radio
jets and their radiation field in the, often heavily dust-enshrouded, central
regions of galaxies. Understanding these mechanisms is an essential ingredient
in the development of cosmological simulations of galaxy evolution.

attributed to the enhanced pressure support from the gas density taper near the
outer edge of the disk. Subtraction of an azimuthally symmetric background
velocity structure reveals localized deviations in the gas kinematics traced by
each of the molecules. Both CO and CS exhibit a `Doppler flip' feature,
centered nearly along the minor axis of the disk (${\rm PA} \sim 60\degr$) at a
radius of $1\farcs35$, coinciding with the large gap observed in scattered
light and mm~continuum. In addition, the CO emission, both through changes in
intensity and its kinematics, traces a tightly wound spiral, previously seen
with higher frequency CO $J = 3-2$ observations (Teague et al., 2019). Through
comparison with linear models of the spiral wakes generated by embedded
planets, we interpret these features in the context of interactions with a
Saturn-mass planet within the gap at a position angle of ${\rm PA} = 60\degr$,
consistent with the theoretical predictions of (Mentiplay et al. 2019). The
lack of a corresponding spiral in the CS emission is attributed to the strong
vertical dependence on the buoyancy spirals which are believed to only grow in
the atmospheric of the disk, rather than those traced by CS emission.

intricate interactions among their constituents. To make interpretable
predictions about their large-scale behavior, it is typically assumed, without
a clear statement, that these dynamics can be reduced to a few number of
equations involving a low-rank matrix describing the network of interactions --
what we call the low-rank hypothesis. Our paper sheds light on this assumption
and questions its validity. By leveraging fundamental theorems on singular
value decomposition, we expose the hypothesis for various random graphs, either
by making explicit their low-rank formulation or by demonstrating the
exponential decrease of their singular values. Notably, we verify the
hypothesis experimentally for real networks by revealing the rapid decrease of
their singular values, which has major consequences on their effective ranks.
We then evaluate the impact of the low-rank hypothesis for general dynamical
systems on networks through an optimal dimension reduction. This allows us to
prove that recurrent neural networks can be exactly reduced, and to connect the
rapidly decreasing singular values of real networks to the dimension reduction
error of the nonlinear dynamics they support, be it microbial, neuronal or
epidemiological. Finally, we prove that higher-order interactions naturally
emerge from the dimension reduction, thus providing theoretical insights into
the origin of higher-order interactions in complex systems.

the solution. For a large class of source terms (including plane-wave
scattering problems), this choice leads to discrete spaces that provide a
uniform approximation error for all wavenumber $k$ with a number of degrees of

for discretization spaces based on (piecewise) polynomials, the number of
degrees of freedom has to scale at least as $k^d$ to achieve the same property.
These theoretical results are illustrated by one-dimensional numerical

show a steeper splitting function for charm quarks compared to gluons and light

analogue of weather systems, and are often thought of as the peak of the
ocean's kinetic energy (KE) wavenumber spectrum [7, 19, 23]. Yet, our
understanding of the ocean's spatial scales has been derived mostly from
Fourier analysis in small representative regions (e.g. [16, 14, 4]), typically
a few hundred kilometers in size, that cannot capture the vast dynamic range at
planetary scales. Here, we present the first truly global wavenumber spectrum
of the oceanic circulation from satellite data and high-resolution re-analysis
data, using a coarse-graining method to analyze scales much larger than what
had been possible before. Spectra spanning over three orders of magnitude in
length-scale reveal the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) as the spectral
peak of the global extra-tropical ocean, at $\approx 10 \times 10^3~$km. We
also find a previously unobserved power-law scaling over scales larger than
$10^3~$km. A smaller spectral peak exists at $\approx 300~$km associated with
the mesoscales, which, due to their wider spread in wavenumber space, account
for more than $50\%$ of the resolved surface KE globally. Length-scales that
are twice as large (up to \(10^3\)~km) exhibit a characteristic lag time of
\(\approx40~\)days in their seasonal cycle, such that in both hemispheres KE at

as a solution for safer roads and better traffic management. One of the
essential protocols in V2X is the Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC)
protocol suite. DSRC includes the IEEE 802.11p protocol that operates at the
medium access control (MAC) and physical (PHY) layers. Upon collision, the IEEE
802.11p MAC layer applies a carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance
(CSMA/CA) mechanism that randomly selects a backoff time to re-check the
channel activity and then retransmit. However, the random selection of the
backoff time may lead to further packet collisions that decrease the
utilization of the communication channel, which suffers from a limited
bandwidth in the first place. This paper proposes a fuzzy model based on
rational decision-making, which we call F-802.11p, to improve the IEEE 802.11p
protocol backoff time selection by limiting the IEEE 802.11p beacon messages to
better use of the available bandwidth. A simulation study presents the
evaluation of our work compared to IEEE 802.11p. We deployed the simulation
software in two scenarios: the Veins Framework map and the map of New
Administrative Cairo in Egypt. We base our comparison on slots backoff, times
into backoff, PHY busy time, MAC busy time, total lost packets, and
generated/received beacon messages. Simulation results show that both protocols
have comparable results in slots backoff, times into back off, and the
generated beacon messages. At the same time, our F-802.11p significantly
outperforms the IEEE 802.11p in PHY busy time, MAC busy time, total lost
packets, and the received beacon messages in both scenarios.

terms of free fermions with nonrelativistic dispersion relation, possessing a

and compute the effective action by integrating out the gapped fermions. In
spite of the fact that the corresponding Dirac operator governing the dynamics
of the original fermions is nonrelativistic, the leading contribution in the
effective action is a usual Abelian $U(1)$ Chern-Simons term. The proximity to
a conventional superconductor induces a pairing potential in the quantum Hall
state, favoring the formation of Cooper pairs. When the pairing is strong
enough, it drives the system to a topological superconducting phase, hosting
Majorana fermions. Even though the continuum $U(1)$ symmetry is broken down to
a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ one, we can forge fictitious $U(1)$ symmetries that enable us
to derive the effective action for the topological superconducting phase, also
given by a Chern-Simons theory. To eliminate spurious states coming from the
artificial symmetry enlargement, we demand that the fields in the effective
action are $O(2)$ instead of $U(1)$ gauge fields. In the $O(2)$ case we have to
sum over the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ bundles in the partition function, which projects
out the states that are not $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants. The corresponding edge
theory is the $U(1)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold, which contains Majorana fermions in

fits to the orbits of both companions in the system utilize both Gaia
astrometry and RVs to also provide a precise dynamical estimate of the
previously uncertain mass of the B component, and therefore derive an age of
$155\pm15$ Myr. We find that theoretical atmospheric/evolutionary models
incorporating deuterium burning for HD206893c, parameterized by cloudy
atmospheres provide a good simultaneous fit to the luminosity of both HD206893B
and c. In addition to utilizing long-term RV information, this effort is an
early example of a direct imaging discovery of a bona fide exoplanet that was
guided in part with Gaia astrometry. Utilizing Gaia astrometry is expected to
be one of the primary techniques going forward to identify and characterize
additional directly imaged planets. Lastly, this discovery is another example
of the power of optical interferometry to directly detect and characterize
extrasolar planets where they form at ice-line orbital separations of 2-4\,au.

appropriately controlling the converters, but currently no market incentives

The increasing deployment of DNNs in critical systems and the surge of

of Trojan attacks necessary. While Neural Trojan detection has been studied in
the image domain, there is a lack of solutions in the NLP domain. In this

Continual-Prune-and-Select (CP&S) finds a subnetwork within the DNN that is

noisy correlations between micro-video semantics and positional information
being encoded into the sequence embeddings. Moreover, PDMRec proposes
contrastive learning strategies which closely match with the characteristics of
the micro-video scenario, thus reducing the interference from micro-video
positions in sequences. We conduct the extensive experiments on two real-world
datasets. The experimental results shows that PDMRec outperforms existing
multiple state-of-the-art models and achieves significant performance
improvements.

is a collection of methods used to detect and correct bugs and faults found in
software code. The first stage of software testing is unit testing, a widely
used technique where individual units of source code are isolated, often
divided up into classes and functions, and tested separately to aid in the
verification of the behavior and functionality of the system. In this chapter,
an overview of GoogleTest (GTest), a xUnit C++ testing framework will be
performed, and a comparison of different available unit test frameworks for use
in the C++ language. On account of the complexity provided by critical embedded
systems, it is difficult to isolate and test the system's behavior, mocking
techniques were considered to enable a real implementation to be replaced with
a fake implementation, the replacement allowed to overcome the challenges
related to hardware dependencies and external factors. Further, this chapter
describes GoogleMock, a part of GoogleTest C++ testing framework that makes the
tests run in isolation.

user-relevant content helping users in their daily activities (e.g., finding
relevant places to visit, content to consume, items to purchase). However, to
be effective, these systems need to collect and analyze large volumes of
personal data (e.g., location check-ins, movie ratings, click rates .. etc.),
which exposes users to numerous privacy threats. In this context, recommender
systems based on Federated Learning (FL) appear to be a promising solution for
enforcing privacy as they compute accurate recommendations while keeping
personal data on the users' devices. However, FL, and therefore FL-based
recommender systems, rely on a central server that can experience scalability
issues besides being vulnerable to attacks. To remedy this, we propose PEPPER,
a decentralized recommender system based on gossip learning principles. In
PEPPER, users gossip model updates and aggregate them asynchronously. At the
heart of PEPPER reside two key components: a personalized peer-sampling
protocol that keeps in the neighborhood of each node, a proportion of nodes
that have similar interests to the former and a simple yet effective model
aggregation function that builds a model that is better suited to each user.
Through experiments on three real datasets implementing two use cases: a
location check-in recommendation and a movie recommendation, we demonstrate
that our solution converges up to 42% faster than with other decentralized
solutions providing up to 9% improvement on average performance metric such as
hit ratio and up to 21% improvement on long tail performance compared to

investigate the effects of SDoH on obesity prevalence among adults in Shelby
County, Tennessee, USA using a geospatial machine-learning approach. Obesity
prevalence was obtained from publicly available CDC 500 cities database while
SDoH indicators were extracted from the U.S. Census and USDA. We examined the
geographic distributions of obesity prevalence patterns using Getis-Ord Gi*
statistics and calibrated multiple models to study the association between SDoH
and adult obesity. Also, unsupervised machine learning was used to conduct
grouping analysis to investigate the distribution of obesity prevalence and
associated SDoH indicators. Results depicted a high percentage of neighborhoods
experiencing high adult obesity prevalence within Shelby County. In the census
tract, median household income, as well as the percentage of individuals who
were black, home renters, living below the poverty level, fifty-five years or
older, unmarried, and uninsured, had a significant association with adult
obesity prevalence. The grouping analysis revealed disparities in obesity
prevalence amongst disadvantaged neighborhoods. More research is needed that
examines linkages between geographical location, SDoH, and chronic diseases.
These findings, which depict a significantly higher prevalence of obesity
within disadvantaged neighborhoods, and other geospatial information can be

astronomy for 21 cm tomography of the Epoch of Reionization, has given rise to
a new class of radio interferometers with $N \gg 100$ antennas. The
availability of low-noise receivers that do not require cryogenic cooling has
driven down the cost of antennas, making it affordable to build sensitivity
with numerous small antennas rather than large dish structures. However, the
computational- and storage-costs of such radio arrays, determined by the
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ scaling of visibility products required for calibration and
imaging, become proportional to the cost of the array itself and drive up the
overall cost of the radio telescope. When antennas in the array are built on a
regular grid, direct-imaging methods based on spatial Fourier transforms of the
array can be exploited to avoid computing the intermediate visibility matrices
that drive the unfavorable scaling. However, such methods rely on the
availability of calibrated antenna voltages which are themselves difficult to
obtain without using visibility matrices. In this thesis, I explore two
real-time calibration strategies that can operate on subsets of visibility
matrices, which can be computed without compromising on the
$\mathcal{O}(N\log{N})$ scaling of direct-imaging systems. For more general
radio interferometer layouts, baseline-dependent averaging with fringe stopping
can be used to decrease the data rate of visibility products. The signal
processing pipeline built for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA)
is outlined in this thesis, which implements both fringe stopping and baseline
dependent averaging to bring down the data rate from nearly 1 Tbps to 15 Gbps.

Experts bridge gaps that often exists in our knowledge about relationships
between data and the parameters of interest. This is especially true in
geoscientific applications, where knowledge of the Earth is derived from
interpretations of observable features and relies on predominantly unproven but
widely accepted theories. Thus, experts facilitate solutions to otherwise
unsolvable problems. However, experts are inherently subjective, and
susceptible to cognitive biases and adverse external effects. This work
examines this problem within geoscience. Three compelling examples are provided
of the prevalence of cognitive biases from previous work. The problem is then
formally defined, and a set of design principles which ensure that any solution
is sufficiently flexible to be readily applied to the range of geoscientific
problems. No solutions exist that reliably capture and reduce cognitive bias in
experts. However, formal expert elicitation methods can be used to assess
expert variation, and a variety of approaches exist that may help to illuminate
uncertainties, avoid misunderstandings, and reduce herding behaviours or
single-expert over-dominance. This work combines existing and future approaches
to reduce expert suboptimality through a flexible modular design where each
module provides a specific function. The design centres around action modules
that force a stop-and-perform step into interpretation tasks. A starter-pack of
modules is provided as an example of the conceptual design. This simple
bias-reduction system may readily be applied in organisations and during

equivalence between the three assumptions and the principle of stationary

The DeFi ecosystem has become richer with the introduction of DeFi
composability projects, such as Lido finance and Curve finance. DeFi
composability denotes the concatenation of DeFi services in which each DeFi
service locks assets as collateral and gives another asset as liquidity of
locked assets to providers. Providers use the tokens given for other
concatenated DeFi services, such as lending, decentralized exchanges (DEXs),
and derivatives. The DeFi ecosystem uses ERC-20 tokens which can represent the
value of an asset. ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are not widely adopted in
DeFi, since they represent rights to an asset and are not considered
appropriate for valuation. In this paper, we propose a new concept, perpetual
contract NFT, which exploits perpetual future contracts in the cryptocurrency
derivatives market. Unlike futures contracts in a traditional derivatives
market, in the cryptocurrency derivatives market, most futures contracts are
perpetual. In addition, the value of futures contract is backed by collateral.
Therefore, if we mint the rights to perpetual contracts as NFT, we can use the
perpetual contract NFT as collateral for DeFi composability. To validate our
proposal and its profitability, we experiment with the position NFT of Uniswap

the crosswalk signals a hassle, which can result in an accident where a car

designing a system that can detect pedestrians and triggering the crosswalk
signal automatically. We collect a dataset of images that we then use to train
a convolutional neural network to distinguish between pedestrians (including
bicycle riders) and various false alarms. The resulting system can capture and

However, the current studies on structural brain networks are totally dependent
on specific toolboxes, which is time-consuming and subjective. Few tools can
obtain the structural brain networks from brain diffusion tensor images. In
this work, an adversarial learning-based structural brain-network generative
model(SBGM) is proposed to directly learn the structural connections from brain
diffusion tensor images. By analyzing the differences in structural brain
networks across subjects, we found that the structural brain networks of
subjects showed a consistent trend from elderly normal controls(NC) to early
mild cognitive impairment(EMCI) to late mild cognitive impairment(LMCI):
structural connectivity progressed in a progressively weaker direction as the
condition worsened. In addition, our proposed model tri-classifies EMCI, LMCI,
and NC subjects, achieving a classification accuracy of 83.33\% on the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative(ADNI) database.

health records (EHR) has been an active research area for predicting risks of
mortality and diseases. Meanwhile, large amounts of narrative clinical notes
provide complementary information, but are often not integrated into predictive
models. In this paper, we provide a novel multimodal transformer to fuse
clinical notes and structured EHR data for better prediction of in-hospital
mortality. To improve interpretability, we propose an integrated gradients (IG)
method to select important words in clinical notes and discover the critical
structured EHR features with Shapley values. These important words and clinical
features are visualized to assist with interpretation of the prediction
outcomes. We also investigate the significance of domain adaptive pretraining
and task adaptive fine-tuning on the Clinical BERT, which is used to learn the
representations of clinical notes. Experiments demonstrated that our model
outperforms other methods (AUCPR: 0.538, AUCROC: 0.877, F1:0.490).

magnetic oxides to elucidate it valence state and lattice incorporation. The
resulting structural and magnetic properties are studied in detail. To the one
end Ni in incorporated by in-diffusion as well as reactive magnetron
co-sputtering in wurtzite ZnO where only the Ni-diffused ZnO exhibits
significant conductivity. This is complemented by Ni and Co codoping of ZnO
leading. To the other end, the ZnCo$_2$O$_4$ spinel is co-doped with varying
amounts of Ni. In the wurtzite oxides Ni is exclusively found on tetrahedral
lattice sites in its formal 2+ oxidation state as deep donor. It behaves as an
anisotropic paramagnet and a limited solubility of Ni about 10\% is found. Due
to its smaller magnetic moment it can induce partial uncompensation of the Co
magnetic moments due to antiferromagnetic coupling. In the spinel Ni is found
to be incorporated in its formal 3+ oxidation state on octahedral sites and
couples antiferromagnetically to the Co moments leading again to magnetic
uncompensation of the otherwise antiferromagnetic ZnCo$_2$O$_4$ spinel and to
ferrimagnetism at higher Ni concentrations. Increasing Ni even further leads to
phase separation of cubic NiO resulting in an exchange-biased composite
magnetic oxide.

  Simulation on Tetrahedral Mesh",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A general framework for the development of high-order compact schemes has
been proposed recently. The core steps of the schemes are composed of the
following. 1). Based on a kinetic model equation, from a generalized initial
distribution of flow variables construct a time-accurate evolution solution of
gas distribution function at a cell interface ; 2). Introduce the WENO-type
weighting functions into the time-derivative of the cell interface flux
function in the multistage multi-derivative time stepping scheme to cope with
the possible impingement of a shock wave on a cell interface within a time
step; 3). Take moments of interface gas distribution function to obtain the
time-accurate flow variables and the corresponding fluxes at the cell
interface, and update the cell-averaged flow variables and their gradients
inside each control volume; 4). Within the physical domain of dependence of the
reconstructed cell, based on the cell-averaged flow variables and their
gradients develop compact initial data reconstruction to get initial flow
distributions at the beginning of next time step. A compact gas-kinetic scheme
(GKS) up to sixth-order accuracy in space and fourth-order in time has been
constructed on 2D unstructured mesh before. In this paper, the compact GKS up
to fourth-order accuracy on 3D tetrahedral mesh will be further constructed
with the focus on the WENO-type initial data reconstruction. Nonlinear weights
are designed to achieve high-order accuracy for the smooth Navier-Stokes
solution and keep super robustness in 3D computation with strong shock
interactions. The fourth-order compact GKS can use a large time step with CFL
number $0.6$ in the simulations from subsonic to hypersonic flow. A series of
test cases are used to validate the scheme. The high-order compact GKS is ready
for 3D applications with complex geometry.

hyperelastic shells through differential growth. The aim of the current work is
to determine the growth tensor (or growth functions) that can produce the
deformation of a shell to the desired shape. First, a consistent finite-strain
shell theory is introduced. The shell equation system is established from the
3D governing system through a series expansion and truncation approach. Based
on the shell theory, the problem of shape-programming is studied under the
stress-free assumption. For a special case in which the parametric coordinate
curves generate a net of curvature lines on the target surface, the sufficient
condition to ensure the vanishing of the stress components is analyzed, from
which the explicit expression of the growth tensor can be derived. In the
general case, we conduct the variable changes and derive the total growth
tensor by considering a two-step deformation of the shell. With these obtained
results, a general theoretical scheme for shape-programming of thin
hyperelastic shells through differential growth is proposed. To demonstrate the
feasibility and efficiency of the proposed scheme, several nature-inspired
examples are studied. The derived growth tensors in these examples have also
been implemented in the numerical simulations to verify their correctness and
accuracy. The simulation results show that the target shapes of the shell
samples can be recovered completely. The scheme for shape-programming proposed
in the current work is helpful in designing and manufacturing intelligent soft
devices.
