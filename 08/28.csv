representing variation in regression coefficients that mimics the piecewise
linearity of ReLU-activated deep neural networks. We used the framework to
formulate a survival model for using medical claims to predict hospital
readmission and death that focuses on discharge placement, adjusting for
confounding in estimating causal local average treatment effects. We trained
the model on a 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 2008 and 2011, based on
their 2009--2011 inpatient episodes, and then tested the model on 2012
episodes. The model scored an AUROC of approximately 0.76 on predicting
all-cause readmissions -- defined using official Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) methodology -- or death within 30-days of discharge,
being competitive against XGBoost and a Bayesian deep neural network,
demonstrating that one need-not sacrifice interpretability for accuracy.
Crucially, as a regression model, we provide what blackboxes cannot -- the
exact gold-standard global interpretation of the model, identifying relative
risk factors and quantifying the effect of discharge placement. We also show
that the posthoc explainer SHAP fails to provide accurate explanations.

main opacity sources present in the upper atmosphere of a transiting planet and
to constrain the composition of the thermosphere and of the unbound exosphere.
Not having a public tool able to automatically extract a high-resolution
transmission spectrum creates a problem of reproducibility for scientific
results. As a consequence, it is very difficult to compare the results obtained
by different research groups and to carry out a homogeneous characterization of
the exoplanetary atmospheres. In this work, we present a standard, publicly
available, user-friendly tool, named SLOPpy (Spectral Lines Of Planets with
python), to automatically extract and analyze the optical transmission spectrum
of exoplanets as accurately as possible. Several data reduction steps are first
performed by SLOPpy to correct the input spectra for sky emission, atmospheric
dispersion, the presence of telluric features and interstellar lines,
center-to-limb variation, and Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, thus making it a
state-of-the-art tool. The pipeline has successfully been applied to HARPS and
HARPS-N data of ideal targets for atmospheric characterization. To first assess
the code's performance and to validate its suitability, here we present a
comparison with the results obtained from the previous analyses of other works
on HD 189733 b, WASP-76 b, WASP-127 b, and KELT-20 b. Comparing our results
with other works that have analyzed the same datasets, we conclude that this
tool gives results in agreement with the published results within 1$\sigma$
most of the time, while extracting, with SLOPpy, the planetary signal with a
similar or higher statistical significance.

in various vision-related tasks. The success of ViTs motivates adversaries to
perform backdoor attacks on ViTs. Although the vulnerability of traditional
CNNs to backdoor attacks is well-known, backdoor attacks on ViTs are
seldom-studied. Compared to CNNs capturing pixel-wise local features by
convolutions, ViTs extract global context information through patches and
attentions. Na\""ively transplanting CNN-specific backdoor attacks to ViTs
yields only a low clean data accuracy and a low attack success rate. In this
paper, we propose a stealth and practical ViT-specific backdoor attack
$TrojViT$. Rather than an area-wise trigger used by CNN-specific backdoor
attacks, TrojViT generates a patch-wise trigger designed to build a Trojan
composed of some vulnerable bits on the parameters of a ViT stored in DRAM
memory through patch salience ranking and attention-target loss. TrojViT
further uses minimum-tuned parameter update to reduce the bit number of the
Trojan. Once the attacker inserts the Trojan into the ViT model by flipping the
vulnerable bits, the ViT model still produces normal inference accuracy with
benign inputs. But when the attacker embeds a trigger into an input, the ViT
model is forced to classify the input to a predefined target class. We show
that flipping only few vulnerable bits identified by TrojViT on a ViT model
using the well-known RowHammer can transform the model into a backdoored one.
We perform extensive experiments of multiple datasets on various ViT models.
TrojViT can classify $99.64\%$ of test images to a target class by flipping
$345$ bits on a ViT for ImageNet.

need to pursue R\&D to implement these in HEP experiments by making larger

mathematical obstacles to proving it with existing methods. In this paper we
prove that when $\alpha$ exceeds the spatial dimension $D$, the effect of local

address these issues by proposing new cost and utility-aware threat models that
are tailored to the adversarial capabilities and constraints of attackers
targeting tabular domains. We introduce a framework that enables us to design

in an open-loop predict-then-optimize process: the renewable energy source

the predictions, system operators solve optimization models such as unit
commitment (UC) to determine the economical operation plans accordingly.
However, such an open-loop process could essentially compromise the operation
economics because its predictors myopically seek to improve the immediate
statistical prediction errors instead of the ultimate operation cost. To this
end, this paper presents a closed-loop predict-and-optimize framework, offering
a prescriptive UC to improve the operation economics. First, a bilevel
mixed-integer programming model is leveraged to train cost-oriented predictors
tailored for optimal system operations: the upper level trains the RES and
reserve predictors based on their induced operation cost; the lower level, with
given predictions, mimics the system operation process and feeds the induced
operation cost back to the upper level. Furthermore, the embeddability of the
trained predictors grants a prescriptive UC model, which simultaneously
provides RES-reserve predictions and UC decisions with enhanced operation
economics. Finally, numerical case studies using real-world data illustrate the
potential economic and practical advantages of prescriptive UC over
deterministic, robust, and stochastic UC models.

models with imperceptible perturbations. In audio, although adversarial
examples have achieved incredible attack success rates on white-box settings
and black-box settings, most existing adversarial attacks are constrained by
the input length. A More practical scenario is that the adversarial examples
must be clipped or self-spliced and input into the black-box model. Therefore,
it is necessary to explore how to improve transferability in different input
length settings. In this paper, we take the synthetic speech detection task as
an example and consider two representative SOTA models. We observe that the
gradients of fragments with the same sample value are similar in different
models via analyzing the gradients obtained by feeding samples into the model
after cropping or self-splicing. Inspired by the above observation, we propose
a new adversarial attack method termed sliding attack. Specifically, we make
each sampling point aware of gradients at different locations, which can
simulate the situation where adversarial examples are input to black-box models
with varying input lengths. Therefore, instead of using the current gradient
directly in each iteration of the gradient calculation, we go through the
following three steps. First, we extract subsegments of different lengths using
sliding windows. We then augment the subsegments with data from the adjacent
domains. Finally, we feed the sub-segments into different models to obtain
aggregate gradients to update adversarial examples. Empirical results
demonstrate that our method could significantly improve the transferability of
adversarial examples after clipping or self-splicing. Besides, our method could
also enhance the transferability between models based on different features.

a novel method for self-supervised video representation learning via motion

RGB frames which are acquired at three different times in the video sequence.
The obtained frames are then transformed into grayscale images where each image
is specified to three different channels such as R(red), G(green), and B(blue)
to form a dynamic grayscale snippet (DGS). Motivated by this, the labels are
automatically generated to increase the temporal diversity based on DGS by
using the different temporal lengths of the videos, which prove to be very
helpful for the downstream task. Benefiting from the self-supervised nature of
our method, we report the results that outperform existing methods on four

galaxies in the early Universe. GLASS-z13 is one of these candidates, with a
reported photometric redshift $z>11.9$. I present publicly available Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 6 Director's Discretionary

spectroscopic redshift for GLASS-z13 by searching for [OIII] line emission in
the redshift range $z=11.9-13.5$. No [OIII] emission is detected in integrated
spectra extracted within an aperture around GLASS-z13, nor when using an
automated line finding algorithm (applying different uv-weighting strategies
for the imaging). 1.2 mm continuum emission associated to GLASS-z13 is not
detected either. If GLASS-z13 is at z$\approx$12-13, this implies a 3-$\sigma$
upper limit on the [OIII] and rest-frame $\sim$90 $\mu$m continuum emission of
$\sim1\times10^8\,\rm{L}_\odot$ and 10.8 $\mu$Jy, respectively. The
non-detection of [OIII] and continuum emission does not necessarily imply that
GLASS-z13 is not at $z\approx12-13$. It can also be explained by a low
metallicity ($\sim 0.2\,\rm{Z}_\odot$ or lower) and/or high-density (at least
100 $\rm{cm}^{-3}$) interstellar medium. This work demonstrates the synergy

Theoretically, we develop an asymptotic theory concerning the limit

whispering gallery modes (WGMs) of an optical microresonator through a

difference of the angular momentum of the WGM and that of the grating, provides
a scalable, chip-integrated solution for OAM generation. However, demonstrated
OAM microresonators have exhibited a much lower quality factor ($Q$) than
conventional WGM resonators (by $>100\times$), and an understanding of the
ultimate limits on $Q$ has been lacking. This is crucial given the importance
of $Q$ in enhancing light-matter interactions, such as single emitter coupling
and parametric nonlinear processes, that underpin many important microresonator
applications. Moreover, though high-OAM states are often desirable, the limits
on what is achievable in a microresonator configuration are not well
understood. Here, we provide new physical insight on these two longstanding
questions, through understanding OAM from the perspective of mode coupling in a
photonic crystal ring, and linking it to the commonly studied case of coherent
backscattering between counter-propagating WGMs. In addition to demonstrating
high-$Q$ ($10^5$ to $10^6$), high estimated OAM ejection efficiency (up to

quantum systems is to ensure engineered coupling to an auxiliary degree of
freedom while maintaining good mechanical isolation from the environment, that
is, low quantum decoherence, consisting of thermal decoherence and dephasing.
Here, we overcome this challenge by introducing a superconducting circuit
optomechanical platform which exhibits a low quantum decoherence while having a
large optomechanical coupling, which allows us to prepare the quantum ground
and squeezed states of motion with high fidelity. We directly measure a thermal
decoherence rate of 20.5 Hz (corresponding to T_1 = 7.7 ms) as well as a pure
dephasing rate of 0.09 Hz, resulted in a 100-fold improvement of quantum-state
lifetime compared to the prior optomechanical systems. This enables us to reach
to 0.07 quanta motional ground state occupation (93% fidelity) and realize
mechanical squeezing of -2.7 dB below zero-point-fluctuation. Furthermore, we
observe the free evolution of mechanical squeezed state, preserving its
non-classical nature over milli-second timescales. Such ultra-low quantum
decoherence not only increases the fidelity of quantum control and measurement

Triangulations (CDT) quantum gravity using computer simulations. On the one
hand, we study the effect of enlarging the ensemble of triangulations by
relaxing the simplicial manifold conditions in a controlled way. On the other
hand, we cast a first look at CDT geometries with spatial topology beyond that
of the sphere or torus. We measure the phase structure of the model for several
triangulation ensembles and spatial topologies, finding evidence that the phase
structure is qualitatively unaffected by these generalizations. Furthermore, we
determine the effective action for the spatial volumes of the system, again
varying the simplicial manifold conditions and the spatial topology. In all
cases where we were able to gather sufficient statistics, we found the
resulting effective action to be consistent with a minisuperspace action
derived from continuum Einstein gravity. We interpret our overall results as
evidence that 1) partially relaxing simplicial manifold conditions or changing
the spatial genus does not affect the continuum limit of 3D CDT and that 2)
increasing the spatial genus of the system likely does not influence the
leading-order terms in the emergent effective action.

voice activity detection (TS-VAD) using transformers. To overcome the original
TS-VAD model's drawback of being unable to handle an arbitrary number of
speakers, we investigate model architectures that use input tensors with
variable-length time and speaker dimensions. Transformer layers are applied to
the speaker axis to make the model output insensitive to the order of the
speaker profiles provided to the TS-VAD model. Time-wise sequential layers are
interspersed between these speaker-wise transformer layers to allow the
temporal and cross-speaker correlations of the input speech signal to be
captured. We also extend a diarization model based on end-to-end neural
diarization with encoder-decoder based attractors (EEND-EDA) by replacing its
dot-product-based speaker detection layer with the transformer-based TS-VAD.
Experimental results on VoxConverse show that using the transformers for the
cross-speaker modeling reduces the diarization error rate (DER) of TS-VAD by
11.3%, achieving a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) DER of 4.57%. Also, our extended
EEND-EDA reduces DER by 6.9% on the CALLHOME dataset relative to the original

we prove a new non-convex enclosure for the spectrum of the Maxwell system,

non-accumulation of eigenvalues on the imaginary axis as well as resolvent

reference instruments when accumulated on their test masses (TMs). Non-contact
charge management systems are required for the most sensitive of these
instruments, with the TMs free-floating, and their charges compensated by
photoelectrons in a feedback loop with a TM charge measurement. Three space
missions have successfully demonstrated this technique: GP-B, LPF, and the
UV-LED mission. Charge management techniques that eliminate the charge
measurement and feedback systems, referred henceforth as passive, reduce the
complexities and disturbance effects introduced by these systems, and are thus
the subject of active research and development work. Passive charge management
depends critically on the stability and reproducibility of the photoemission
properties of a given system. In support of this work, we present comprehensive
flight characterization data for a suite of 16 UV-LEDs in various
configurations and 255+/-1 nm center wavelength. Flight data was acquired
between December 2014 and December 2015 with the UV-LED instrument flown on
SaudiSat 4. We back up our results with ground-based measurements performed in
configurations comparable to the flight one between September 4, 2020, and
October 8, 2020. All results confirm the excellent reliability of the UV-LEDs
in the space environment, are fully consistent with the findings of ground
studies, and support the approach of using LEDs for passive charge management.
We find that the equilibrium potential of the TM, under illumination by the 255
nm LEDs, is independent of the UV intensity and reproduceable to about +/- 6
mV, or +/-6 fC/pF, over periods of up to six months. The value of the
equilibrium potential is dependent on the geometry of the electric field
between the TM and its enclosure, and thus on the exact configuration of the
instrument.

significant challenges in federated learning (FL) over resource-limited edge
nodes. A potential solution to this problem is to deploy off-the-shelf sparse
learning algorithms that train a binary sparse mask on each client with the
expectation of training a consistent sparse server mask yielding sparse weight
tensors. However, as we investigate in this paper, such naive deployments
result in a significant drop in accuracy compared to FL with dense models,
especially for clients with limited resource budgets. In particular, our
investigations reveal a serious lack of consensus among the trained sparsity
masks on clients, which prevents convergence for the server mask and
potentially leads to a substantial drop in model performance. Based on such key
observations, we propose \textit{federated lottery aware sparsity hunting}
(FLASH), a unified sparse learning framework to make the server win a lottery
in terms of yielding a sparse sub-model, able to maintain classification
performance under highly resource-limited client settings. Moreover, to support
FL on different devices requiring different parameter density, we leverage our
findings to present \textit{hetero-FLASH}, where clients can have different
target sparsity budgets based on their device resource limits. Experimental
evaluations with multiple models on various datasets (both IID and non-IID)
show superiority of our models in closing the gap with unpruned baseline while
yielding up to $\mathord{\sim}10.1\%$ improved accuracy with
$\mathord{\sim}10.26\times$ fewer communication costs, compared to existing
alternatives, at similar hyperparameter settings.

properties of $0$-regular bundles (in the sense of Castelnuovo-Mumford) on a
polarized smooth projective variety $(X,\mathcal{O}_X(1))$. Secondly, we study
the continuous CM-regularity of torsion-free coherent sheaves on
$(X,\mathcal{O}_X(1))$, and its relation with the theory of generic vanishing.
This continuous variant of CM-regularity was introduced by Mustopa, and he
raised the question whether a continuously $1$-regular such sheaf $\mathcal{F}$
is GV. Here we answer the question in the affirmative for many pairs
$(X,\mathcal{O}_X(1))$ which includes the case of any polarized abelian
variety. Moreover, for these pairs, we show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is
continuously $k$-regular for some integer $1\leq k\leq \dim X$, then
$\mathcal{F}$ is a GV$_{-(k-1)}$ sheaf. Further, we extend the notion of
continuous CM-regularity to a real valued function on the $\mathbb{Q}$-twisted
bundles on polarized abelian varieties $(X,\mathcal{O}_X(1))$, and we show that
this function can be extended to a continuous function on
$N^1(X)_{\mathbb{R}}$. We also provide syzygetic consequences of our results
for $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})}(1)$ on $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})$
associated to a $0$-regular bundle $\mathcal{E}$ on polarized smooth projective
varieties. In particular, when $X$ is abelian, we show that

base-point freeness threshold of the class of $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ in $N^1(X)$ is

together. Aiming to identify representative qualitative features of the
AHU-to-TCL coupling, we build a realistic but also sufficiently simple model
and analyze it in two distinct regimes: the Constant Supply Temperature (CST)
and the Constant Power Input (CPI) regimes. In both cases, we center our
analysis on the relaxation dynamics of individual TCL temperatures to a
statistically steady state. We observe that while the dynamics are relatively
fast in the CST regime, resulting in all TCLs evolving around the control
setpoint, the CPI regime reveals emergence of a \emph{bi-modal probability
distribution and two, possibly strongly separated, time scales}. We observe
that the two modes in the CPI regime are associated with all TCLs being in the
same low and high-temperature states, respectively, with occasional (and
therefore possibly rare) collective transition between the modes akin in the
Kramer's phenomenon of statistical physics. To the best of our knowledge, this
phenomenon was overlooked in the context of the multi-zone energy building
engineering, even thought it has direct implications on the operations of
centralized cooling systems in buildings. It teaches us that a balance needs to
be struck between occupational comfort -- related to variations in the
individual temperatures -- and power output predictability -- the main focus of

analysis of huge amount of data on social media platforms is difficult. This
has opened new research directions for automatic analysis of usercontributed
social media documents. Automatic social media data analysis is difficult due
to abundant information shared by users. Many researchers use Twitter data for
Social Media Analysis (SMA) as the Twitter data is freely available in the
public domain. One of the most this research work. Event Detection from social
media data is used for different applications like traffic congestion
detection, disaster and emergency management, and live news detection. Nature
of the information which is shared on twitter platform is short-text, noisy,
and ambiguous. Thus, event detection and extraction of event phrases from
user-generated and illformed data becomes challenging. To address these
challenges, events are extracted from streaming social media data in the form
of keyphrases using different cognitive properties. The motivation behind this
research work is to provide substantial improvements in the lexical variation
of event phrases while detecting events and sub-events from twitter data. In
this research work, the approach towards event detection from social media data
is divided into three phases namely: Identifying sub-graphs in Microblog Word
Co-occurrence Network (WCN) which provides important information about
keyphrases; Identifying multiple events from social media data; and Ranking
contextual information of event phrases.

whose components are identified using the expectation-maximization (EM)

solving a maximum likelihood estimation problem iteratively until convergence.

log-concave sequences in combinatorics. The ground-breaking techniques
developed in those work are from algebraic geometry: ""We believe that behind
any log-concave sequence that appears in nature there is such a Hodge structure
responsible for the log-concavity"".
  A function is called completely monotone if its derivatives alternate in
signs; e.g., $e^{-t}$. A fundamental conjecture in mathematical physics and
Shannon information theory is on the complete monotonicity of Gaussian
distribution (GCMC), which states that $I(X+Z_t)$\footnote{The probability
density function of $X+Z_t$ is called ""heat flow"" in mathematical physics.} is
completely monotone in $t$, where $I$ is Fisher information, random variables
$X$ and $Z_t$ are independent and $Z_t\sim\mathcal{N}(0,t)$ is Gaussian.
  Inspired by the algebraic geometry method introduced by J. Huh, GCMC is
reformulated in the form of a log-convex sequence. In general, a completely
monotone function can admit a log-convex sequence and a log-convex sequence can
further induce a log-concave sequence. The new formulation may guide GCMC to
the marvelous temple of algebraic geometry. Moreover, to make GCMC more

of spherical particles in a dilute polymer solution. For a particle-free
polymeric fluid, in addition to the solvent viscosity, the extensional
viscosity due to the polymers, $\mu^\text{poly}$, contributes to the total
non-dimensionalized extensional viscosity $1+\mu^\text{poly}$. When a small
volume fraction, $\phi$, of spheres is added to a polymeric fluid, the stress
is altered by the Einstein viscosity of 2.5$\phi$ and two additional stress
contributions: the interaction stresslet and the particle-induced polymer
stress (PIPS). The net interaction stress is positive at lower Deborah numbers
(product of extension rate and polymer relaxation time), $De\lesssim0.5$, and
negative at large $De$. Relative to undisturbed flow, the presence of spheres
in uniaxial extensional flow creates larger and smaller local stretching
regions. Below the coil-stretch transition ($De<0.5$), the polymers far from
the particles are in a coiled state, and a wake of stretched polymers forms
downstream of the particle as they are stretched by the large stretching
regions around the particle. This leads to a positive interaction stresslet
(surface) and the PIPS (stretched wake). Beyond the coil-stretch transition,
polymers far from the particle are highly stretched, but they collapse closer
to the coiled state as they arrive at the low-stretching regions near the
particle surface. Therefore, a negative PIPS results from the regions of
collapsed polymers. When $De\gtrsim0.6$, the changes in extensional viscosity
from the interaction stresslet and the PIPS are $\phi\mu^\text{poly}$ and
approximately -1.85$\phi\mu^\text{poly}$, respectively. At large $De$, the
polymer extensional viscosity, $\mu^\text{poly}$, is large. Therefore, adding
particles reduces the extensional viscosity of the suspension
($(2.5-0.85\mu^\text{poly})\phi<0$).

we propose a single-step implementation of a multi-target-qubit controlled-NOT

cat-state qubits. In this proposal, the gate is implemented with $n$ microwave
cavities coupled to a three-level SC qutrit. The two logic states of the
control SC qubit are represented by the two lowest levels of the qutrit, while
the two logic states of each target cat-state qubit are represented by two
quasi-orthogonal cat states of a microwave cavity. This proposal operates
essentially through the dispersive coupling of each cavity with the qutrit. The
gate realization is quite simple because it requires only a single-step
operation. There is no need of applying a classical pulse or performing a
measurement. The gate operation time is independent of the number of target
qubits, thus it does not increase as the number of target qubits increases.
Moreover, because the third higher energy level of the qutrit is not occupied
during the gate operation, decoherence from the qutrit is greatly suppressed.
As an application of this hybrid multi-target-qubit gate, we further discuss
the generation of a hybrid Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled state of
SC qubits and cat-state qubits. As an example, we numerically analyze the

energy from one light beam to the other under certain conditions, has received
considerable attention in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) and plasma optics.
To evaluate the coupling dynamics precisely, we modeled this process with
full-wave coupled Schrodinger equations (CSEs) and a nonlinear refractive
index. We found that the CSEs constituted a Hamiltonian system and proposed an
arbitrary higher-order explicit symplectic algorithm to solve the CSEs
numerically. The numerical results given by the developed BEAM code showed a
good agreement with those from particle-in-cell simulations, which demonstrated
the validity of the model and algorithm. The model and numerical algorithm
presented in this work can be extended to more nonlinear optical interactions

caused by a few discrete attributes and variations, e.g., art, real, painting,
quickdraw, etc. We argue that this is not realistic as it is implausible to
define the real-world datasets using a few discrete attributes. Therefore, we
propose to investigate a new problem namely the Continuous Domain Adaptation
(CDA) through the lens where infinite domains are formed by continuously
varying attributes. Leveraging knowledge of two labeled source domains and
several observed unlabeled target domains data, the objective of CDA is to
learn a generalized model for whole data distribution with the continuous
attribute. Besides the contributions of formulating a new problem, we also
propose a novel approach as a strong CDA baseline. To be specific, firstly we
propose a novel alternating training strategy to reduce discrepancies among
multiple domains meanwhile generalize to unseen target domains. Secondly, we
propose a continuity constraint when estimating the cross-domain divergence
measurement. Finally, to decouple the discrepancy from the mini-batch size, we
design a domain-specific queue to maintain the global view of the source domain
that further boosts the adaptation performances. Our method is proven to
achieve the state-of-the-art in CDA problem using extensive experiments. The

frequency and poling effect on ferroelectricity as well as multiferroicity, we
performed electric polarization vs. electric field measurement at different

In order to further investigate this effect, the magneto-electric (ME) coupling

to the switching of electric domain walls under low frequencies that continue
to respond to at much extent to the higher frequencies. The coupling between
disordered electric dipoles with local spin moments could cause presence of
strong magneto-electric coupling. Moreover, the bipolar resistive switching in
trilayer memory devices also supports the ferroelectric behavior of HT-
Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene film and showed uniform repeatability in switching
behavior due to minimum dielectric loss inside ferroelectric
HT-Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene along with improved on/off ratio in comparison to

deraining is currently dominated by supervised learning with synthesized data
generated by e.g., Photoshop rendering. However, the generalization to real
rainy scenes is usually limited due to the gap between synthetic and real-world
data. In this paper, we first statistically explore why the supervised
deraining models cannot generalize well to real rainy cases, and find the
substantial difference of synthetic and real rainy data. Inspired by our
studies, we propose to remove rain by learning favorable deraining
representations from other connected tasks. In connected tasks, the label for
real data can be easily obtained. Hence, our core idea is to learn
representations from real data through task transfer to improve deraining
generalization. We thus term our learning strategy as \textit{task transfer
learning}. If there are more than one connected tasks, we propose to reduce
model size by knowledge distillation. The pretrained models for the connected
tasks are treated as teachers, all their knowledge is distilled to a student
network, so that we reduce the model size, meanwhile preserve effective prior
representations from all the connected tasks. At last, the student network is
fine-tuned with minority of paired synthetic rainy data to guide the pretrained
prior representations to remove rain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
proposed task transfer learning strategy is surprisingly successful and
compares favorably with state-of-the-art supervised learning methods and
apparently surpass other semi-supervised deraining methods on synthetic data.
Particularly, it shows superior generalization over them to real-world scenes.

which results in the sublinear power dependence of photoresponse and lower
optoelectronic efficiency. The desirable superlinear photocurrent is mostly
achieved by sophisticated 2D heterostructures or device arrays, while 2D
materials rarely show intrinsic superlinear photoresponse. Here, we report the
giant superlinear power dependence of photocurrent based on multi-layer
Ta$_2$NiS$_5$. While the fabricated photodetector exhibits good sensitivity
($3.1 mS/W$ per square) and fast photoresponse ($31 \mu$$s$), the bias-,
polarization-, and spatial-resolved measurements point to an intrinsic
photoconductive mechanism. By increasing the incident power density from $1.5
\mu$W/$\mu$$m^{2}$ to $200 \mu$W/$\mu$$m^{2}$, the photocurrent power
dependence varies from sublinear to superlinear. At higher illuminating
conditions, a prominent superlinearity is observed with a giant power exponent
of $\gamma=1.5$. The unusual photoresponse can be explained by a
two-recombination-center model where the distinct density of states of the
recombination centers effectively closes all recombination channels. The
fabricated photodetector is integrated into camera for taking photos with
enhanced contrast due to the superlinearity. Our work provides an effective
route to enable higher optoelectronic efficiency at extreme conditions.

coding where a frame is divided into fixed-sized blocks that are motion
compensated independently. This often leads to coding inefficiency as
fixed-sized blocks hardly align with the object boundaries. Although
hierarchical block-partitioning has been introduced to address this, the
increased number of motion vectors limits the benefit. Recently, approximate
segmentation of images with cuboidal partitioning has gained popularity. Not
only are the variable-sized rectangular segments (cuboids) readily amenable to
block-based image/video coding techniques, but they are also capable of
aligning well with the object boundaries. This is because cuboidal partitioning
is based on a homogeneity constraint, minimising the sum of squared errors
(SSE). In this paper, we have investigated the potential of cuboids in motion
modelling against the fixed-sized blocks used in scalable video coding.
Specifically, we have constructed motion-compensated current frame using the
cuboidal partitioning information of the anchor frame in a group-of-picture

encoding the current frame as an enhancement layer using the scalable HEVC
encoder. Experimental results confirm 6.71%-10.90% bitrate savings on 4K video

challenge in operational forecasting and contributes significantly to the
development of major TCs. RI is commonly defined as an increase in the maximum
sustained surface wind speed beyond a certain threshold within 24 h. The most
widely used threshold is 30 kt (15.4 m/s), which was determined statistically.
Here we propose a new definition for RI by objectively clustering TCs using the
intensification rate, initial intensity, and radius of the maximum wind speed.
A group of 770 samples is separated at a threshold of 45 kt (23.2 m/s). The
threshold is 40 kt (20.6 m/s) for the western North Atlantic, where TC size
measurements are more reliable. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the
proposed threshold is robust even considering the uncertainty in RMW of as high
as 30 km. We show that, when a TC undergoes RI, its maximum wind speed is
approximately 60+/-15 kt (30.9+/-7.7 m/s) and the radius of the maximum wind
speed is 45+/-20 km. The new threshold outperforms the conventional threshold
of 30 kt/24h in (1) describing the bimodal distribution of lifetime maximum
intensity, and (2) explaining the annual count of Category 5 TCs. This new
definition provides a more physically-based threshold and describes a more
reliable representation to the extreme events. Although more comparisons are
needed for operational application, it is likely to be desirable for
process-based case studies, and could provide a more valuable metric for TC
intensification classification and research.

representations or labels. In this work, we consider a realistic, but much less
explored, cross-device FL setting in which no client has the capacity to train
a full large model nor is willing to share any intermediate representations
with the server. To this end, we present Principal Sub-Model (PriSM) training
methodology, which leverages models low-rank structure and kernel orthogonality
to train sub-models in the orthogonal kernel space. More specifically, by
applying singular value decomposition to original kernels in the server model,
PriSM first obtains a set of principal orthogonal kernels with importance
weighed by their singular values. Thereafter, PriSM utilizes a novel sampling
strategy that selects different subsets of the principal kernels independently
to create sub-models for clients with reduced computation and communication
requirements. Importantly, a kernel with a large singular value is assigned
with a high sampling probability. Thus, each sub-model is a low-rank
approximation of the full large model, and all clients together achieve nearly
full coverage of the principal kernels. To further improve memory efficiency,
PriSM exploits low-rank structure in intermediate representations and allows
each sub-model to learn only a subset of them while still preserving training
performance.

adaptively handle partitioning skew in pipelined execution. Reshape employs a
two-phase approach that transfers load in a fine-tuned manner to mitigate skew

structures. This class has been dubbed the homologous superlattices. For a
famous example, when a mixture of indium and zinc is oxidized, the phases of
In-O and ZnO separate in an orderly periodic manner, along the ZnO polar axis,

social influence metric based on both influence and conformity. We measure this
new approach using two opinion formation models: (i) the Degroot model and (ii)
our own proposed model. Previously published research studies have not
considered conformity, and have only considered the influence of the nodes when
computing the social influence. In our definition, nodes with low in-degree and
high out-degree that were connected to nodes with high out-degree and low
in-degree had higher centrality. As the main contribution of this research, we

Concentrating on the decentralized stochastic gradient (DSGD) algorithm, we
characterize the transient time, defined as the minimum number of iterations
required such that DSGD can achieve comparable performance as its centralized
counterpart. When the Hessians for the objective functions are identical at
different agents, we show that the transient time of DSGD is $O( n^{4/3} /
\rho^{8/3})$ for smooth (possibly non-convex) objective functions, where $n$ is
the number of agents and $\rho$ is the spectral gap of connectivity graph. This
is improved over the bound of $O( n^2 / \rho^4 )$ without the Hessian
homogeneity assumption. Our analysis leverages a property that the objective
function is twice continuously differentiable. Numerical experiments are
presented to illustrate the essence of data homogeneity to fast convergence of
DSGD.

at densities above the saturation density ($\rho_0$) has led to the emergence
of a multitude of models based on different assumptions and techniques. These
EoSs, when used to describe a neutron star (NS), lead to differing values of
observables. An outstanding goal in astrophysics is to constrain the dense
matter EoS by exploiting astrophysical and gravitational wave measurements.
Nuclear matter parameters appear as Taylor coefficients in the expansion of the
EoS around the saturation density of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter,
and provide a physically-motivated representation of the EoS. In this paper, we
introduce a deep learning-based methodology to predict key neutron star
observables such as the NS mass, NS radius, and tidal deformability from a set
of nuclear matter parameters. Using generated mock data, we confirm that the
neural network model is able to accurately capture the underlying physics of
finite nuclei and replicate inter-correlations between the symmetry energy
slope, its curvature and the tidal deformability arising from a set of physical
constraints. We study the validity of our trained model using Bayesian
inference and show that the performance of our model is on par with
physics-based models with the added benefit of much lower computational cost.

vital role in providing secure facial access to digital devices. Most existing
video-based PAD countermeasures lack the ability to cope with long-range
temporal variations in videos. Moreover, the key-frame sampling prior to the
feature extraction step has not been widely studied in the face anti-spoofing
domain. To mitigate these issues, this paper provides a data sampling approach
by proposing a video processing scheme that models the long-range temporal
variations based on Gaussian Weighting Function. Specifically, the proposed
scheme encodes the consecutive t frames of video sequences into a single RGB
image based on a Gaussian-weighted summation of the t frames. Using simply the
data sampling scheme alone, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art performance
can be achieved without any bells and whistles in both intra-database and
inter-database testing scenarios for the three public benchmark datasets;
namely, Replay-Attack, MSU-MFSD, and CASIA-FASD. In particular, the proposed

  Steam Wankel Expander",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A volumetric Wankel steam expander has numerous advantages over other
positive displacement machines as an expansion device due to its high power to
weight ratio, compactness, lower noise, vibration, and potentially lower
specific cost making them a favourable choice over reciprocating expanders.
Pressure drop of steam during admission through rotary valves, is inevitable
across the intake manifold of the expander during admission duration. These
pressure losses during intake, changes the design pressure ratio across the
actual expander, which leads to a reduced power output by a reasonable margin
of 20 to 30%. Therefore, it is crucial to reduce it to improve the net power
output. The goal of the present research is twofold. In the first part, the
pressure losses across the intake manifold of the expander is estimated for an
existing rectangular port geometry. In the second part, a trapezoidal port
profile of same hydraulic diameter is designed for the intake manifold with an
aim to reduce the intake losses, thereby delivering a higher power output. The
thermodynamic analysis is carried out for the theoretical pressure-volume cycle
of the expander using Python 3.8 and the obtained data are fed into the
developed CFD model on the intake manifold in ANSYS Fluent 19.2. The boundary
conditions are obtained from the aforementioned thermodynamic model, and the
state point values are obtained from the REFPROP database. It is observed that
the trapezoidal port significantly reduces the pressure losses by a margin of
around 50%, thereby delivering around 7 to 21% higher net power output and a
increment of isentropic efficiency by a margin of 14% over a range of
rotational speed varying from 1200 to 3000 RPM. Further investigations are
conducted to study the effect of different fluid flow and turbulent parameters
on the pressure loss, power output and isentropic efficiency of the expander.

find people who can have the maximum influence on other nodes in the network in
a cascade manner if they are chosen as the seed nodes of a network diffusion

has been proven that this is an NP-complete problem and does not have a

have so far shown poor performance.
  In this work, we overcome these limitations by proposing RUAD, a novel

achieved by considering temporal dependencies in the data and including
long-short term memory cells in the model architecture. The proposed approach

outperforms the current SoA unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on

tool with applications to a wide range of physical systems, including defective
crystals, fluctuating membranes, and more. A complex coordinates formulation of
stress function, known as Kolosov-Muskhelishvili formalism, enabled the
analysis of elastic problems with singular domains, particularly cracks,
forming the basis for fracture mechanics. A shortcoming of this method is its
limitation to linear elasticity, which assumes Hookean energy and linear strain
measure. Under finite loads, the linearized strain fails to describe the
deformation field adequately, reflecting the onset of geometric nonlinearity.
The latter is common in materials experiencing large rotations, such as regions
close to the crack tip or elastic metamaterials. While a nonlinear stress
function formalism exists, Kolosov-Muskhelishvili complex representation had
not been generalized and remained limited to linear elasticity. This paper
develops a Kolosov-Muskhelishvili formalism for nonlinear stress function. The
new formalism allows us to port methods from complex analysis to nonlinear
elasticity and to solve nonlinear problems in singular domains. Upon
implementing the method to the crack problem, we discover that nonlinear
solutions strongly depend on the applied remote loads, excluding a universal
form of the solution close to the crack tip and questioning the validity of
previous studies of nonlinear crack analysis.

black-box attacks on fine-tuned models (BAFT) are limited by strong
assumptions. To fill the gap, we propose two novel BAFT settings, cross-domain
and cross-domain cross-architecture BAFT, which only assume that (1) the target
model for attacking is a fine-tuned model, and (2) the source domain data is
known and accessible. To successfully attack fine-tuned models under both
settings, we propose to first train an adversarial generator against the source
model, which adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and maps a clean input to
an adversarial example. Then we search in the low-dimensional latent space
produced by the encoder of the adversarial generator. The search is conducted
under the guidance of the surrogate gradient obtained from the source model.
Experimental results on different domains and different network architectures
demonstrate that the proposed attack method can effectively and efficiently
attack the fine-tuned models.

  Approach For Accent Transfer Tasks","To be published in Interspeech 2022",,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Transfer tasks in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis - where one or more aspects
of the speech of one set of speakers is transferred to another set of speakers
that do not feature these aspects originally - remains a challenging task. One
of the challenges is that models that have high-quality transfer capabilities
can have issues in stability, making them impractical for user-facing critical
tasks. This paper demonstrates that transfer can be obtained by training a
robust TTS system on data generated by a less robust TTS system designed for a
high-quality transfer task; in particular, a CHiVE-BERT monolingual TTS system
is trained on the output of a Tacotron model designed for accent transfer.
While some quality loss is inevitable with this approach, experimental results
show that the models trained on synthetic data this way can produce high
quality audio displaying accent transfer, while preserving speaker
characteristics such as speaking style.

existing video deblurring models trained on them can generalize well to
real-world blurry videos. In recent years, deep learning-based approaches have
achieved promising success on video deblurring task. However, the models
trained on existing synthetic datasets still suffer from generalization
problems over real-world blurry scenarios with undesired artifacts. The factors
accounting for the failure remain unknown. Therefore, we revisit the classical
blur synthesis pipeline and figure out the possible reasons, including shooting
parameters, blur formation space, and image signal processor~(ISP). To analyze
the effects of these potential factors, we first collect an ultra-high
frame-rate (940 FPS) RAW video dataset as the data basis to synthesize various
kinds of blurs. Then we propose a novel realistic blur synthesis pipeline
termed as RAW-Blur by leveraging blur formation cues. Through numerous
experiments, we demonstrate that synthesizing blurs in the RAW space and
adopting the same ISP as the real-world testing data can effectively eliminate
the negative effects of synthetic data. Furthermore, the shooting parameters of
the synthesized blurry video, e.g., exposure time and frame-rate play
significant roles in improving the performance of deblurring models.
Impressively, the models trained on the blurry data synthesized by the proposed
RAW-Blur pipeline can obtain more than 5dB PSNR gain against those trained on
the existing synthetic blur datasets. We believe the novel realistic synthesis
pipeline and the corresponding RAW video dataset can help the community to
easily construct customized blur datasets to improve real-world video
deblurring performance largely, instead of laboriously collecting real data
pairs.

inspection of the most recent accumulation of the data provided by the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we have noticed several conspicuous
events with `volcano-like' symmetric shape, lasting all for several hours,
which closely resemble the achromatic events detected with the previous Whole
Earth Blazar Telescope campaigns targeting the source. We propose that those
peculiar features could be due to the gravitational micro-lensing of the
innermost segments of the precessing jet in the system, by a binary lens. We
study the magnification pattern of the lens with the inverse-ray shooting
method, and the source trajectory parameters with the Python package
MuLensModel. In this way, we were able to fit successfully all the selected
events with a single lens, adjusting slightly only the source trajectory
parameters for each lensing event. Based on the fit results, we postulate the
presence of a massive binary lens, containing an intermediate-mass black hole,
possibly even a super-massive one, and a much less massive companion (by a
factor of $\lesssim 0.01$), located within the host galaxy of the blazar, most
likely the central kiloparsec region. We discuss the major physical
implications of the proposed scenario regarding the quest for the

Quantum walks are powerful kernels for developing new and useful quantum

programmable photonic quantum computing system. The system integrates a silicon
quantum photonic chip, enabling the simulation of quantum walk dynamics on
graphs with up to 400 vertices and possessing full programmability over quantum

average fidelity of random entangled quantum states after the whole on-chip

demonstrated exponentially faster hitting and quadratically faster mixing
performance of quantum walks over classical random walks, achieving more than
two orders of magnitude of enhancement in the experimental hitting efficiency
and almost half of the reduction in the experimental evolution time for mixing.
We utilize the system to implement a series of quantum applications, including
measuring the centrality of scale-free networks, searching targets on
Erd\""{o}s-R\'{e}nyi networks, distinguishing non-isomorphic graph pairs, and
simulating the topological phase of higher-order topological insulators. Our

reduce the MOSFET subthreshold swing below the critical value, and to decrease
the gate voltage below the fundamental Boltzmann limit. However, we failed to

since 1970's. In each iteration higher-order (also called tensor) methods
minimize a regularized Taylor expansion of the objective function, which leads
to faster convergence rates if the corresponding higher-order derivative is
Lipschitz-continuous. Recently a series of lower iteration complexity bounds
for such methods were proved, and a gap between upper an lower complexity
bounds was revealed. Moreover, it was shown that such methods can be
implementable since the appropriately regularized Taylor expansion of a convex
function is also convex and, thus, can be minimized in polynomial time. Only
very recently an algorithm with optimal convergence rate $1/k^{(3p+1)/2}$ was

feature in the design of approaches to many speech tasks. Increasingly, such
approaches have emphasized ""disentanglement"", where a representation contains
only parts of the speech signal relevant to transcription while discarding
irrelevant information. In this paper, we construct a representation learning
task based on joint modeling of ASR and TTS, and seek to learn a representation
of audio that disentangles that part of the speech signal that is relevant to
transcription from that part which is not. We present empirical evidence that
successfully finding such a representation is tied to the randomness inherent
in training. We then make the observation that these desired, disentangled
solutions to the optimization problem possess unique statistical properties.
Finally, we show that enforcing these properties during training improves WER
by 24.5% relative on average for our joint modeling task. These observations
motivate a novel approach to learning effective audio representations.

particles is of paramount interest to designers as it allows for the rapid
assessment of the feasibility of specific trap requirements or the quality of a
given design. In this paper, performance limitations are defined for convexity
of magnetic trapping potential and bias field using a local approximation in
the trapping center. As an example, the fundamental bounds are computed for
current supporting regions in the form of a spherical shell, a cylindrical
region, and a box. A Pareto-optimal set considering both objectives is found
and compared with known designs of the Baseball trap and Ioffe-Pritchard trap.
The comparison reveals a significant gap in the performance of classical trap
designs from the fundamental limitations. This indicates a possibility of
improved trap designs and modern techniques of shape synthesis are applied in
order to prove their existence. The topologically optimized traps perform
almost two times better as compared to conventional designs. Last, but not
least, the developed framework might serve as a prototype for the formulation
of fundamental limitations on plasma confinement in a wider sense.

to generate the hybrid maximally entangled state of a CV qudit and a DV qudit
by using two microwave cavities coupled to a superconducting flux qutrit. This
proposal relies on the initial preparation of a superposition of Fock states of
one cavity and the initial preparation of a cat state of the other cavity.
After the initial state of each cavity is prepared, this proposal requires only
two basic operations, i.e., the first operation employs the dispersive coupling
of both cavities with the qutrit while the second operation uses the dispersive
coupling of only one cavity with the qutrit. The entangled state production is
deterministic and the operation time decreases as the dimensional size of each
qudit increases. In addition, during the entire operation, the coupler qutrit
remains in the ground state and thus decoherence from the qutrit is
significantly reduced. As an example, we further discuss the experimental
feasibility for generating the hybrid maximally entangled state of a DV qutrit
and a CV qutrit based on circuit QED. This proposal is universal and can be
extended to accomplish the same task, by using two microwave or optical

which is an essential step toward embodied intelligence. Due to the diversity
of interactive affordance, the uniqueness of different individuals leads to
diverse interactions, which makes it difficult to establish an explicit link
between object parts and affordance labels. Human has the ability that
transforms the various exocentric interactions into invariant egocentric
affordance to counter the impact of interactive diversity. To empower an agent
with such ability, this paper proposes a task of affordance grounding from
exocentric view, i.e., given exocentric human-object interaction and egocentric
object images, learning the affordance knowledge of the object and transferring
it to the egocentric image using only the affordance label as supervision.
However, there is some ""interaction bias"" between personas, mainly regarding
different regions and different views. To this end, we devise a cross-view
affordance knowledge transfer framework that extracts affordance-specific
features from exocentric interactions and transfers them to the egocentric
view. Specifically, the perception of affordance regions is enhanced by
preserving affordance co-relations. In addition, an affordance grounding

from $36$ affordance categories. Experimental results demonstrate that our

disruption precursors. This allows us to tell the types of incoming disruption

disruption predictor called Interpretable Disruption Predictor based On
Physics-guided feature extraction (IDP-PGFE) on J-TEXT. The prediction
performance of the model is effectively improved by extracting physics-guided
features. A high-performance model is required to ensure the validity of the
interpretation results. The interpretability study of IDP-PGFE provides an
understanding of J-TEXT disruption and is generally consistent with existing
comprehension of disruption. IDP-PGFE has been applied to the disruption due to
continuously increasing density towards density limit experiments on J-TEXT.
The time evolution of the PGFE features contribution demonstrates that the
application of ECRH triggers radiation-caused disruption, which lowers the
density at disruption. While the application of RMP indeed raises the density
limit in J-TEXT. The interpretability study guides intuition on the physical
mechanisms of density limit disruption that RMPs affect not only the MHD

topological phases are accompanied by condensation and confinement of anyons.
However, for non-Abelian topological phases, more intricate phenomena can occur
at their phase transitions, because the multiple degenerate degrees of freedom
of a non-Abelian anyon can change in different ways after phase transitions. In
this paper, we study these new phenomena, including partial condensation,
partial deconfinement and especially anyon splitting (a non-Abelian anyon
splits into different kinds of the new anyon species) using projected entangled
pair states (PEPS). First, we show that anyon splitting can be observed from
the topologically degenerate ground states. Next, we construct a set of PEPS
describing all possible degrees of freedom of the same non-Abelian anyon. From
the overlaps of this set of PEPS of a given non-Abelian anyon with the ground
state, we can extract the information of partial condensation. Then, we
construct a central object, a matrix defined by the norms and overlaps among
the PEPS in that set. The information of partial deconfinement can be extracted
from this matrix. In particular, we use it to construct an order parameter
which can directly detect anyon splitting. We demonstrate the power of our
approach by applying it to a range of non-Abelian topological phase
transitions: From $D(S_3)$ quantum double to toric code, from $D(S_3)$ quantum
double to $D(Z_3)$ quantum double, from Rep($S_3$) string-net to toric code,

for applications such as fraud detection. Nevertheless, there usually exists an
exponential number of MBPs, which brings up two issues when enumerating MBPs,
namely the effectiveness issue (many MBPs are of low values) and the efficiency
issue (enumerating all MBPs is not affordable on large graphs). Existing
proposals of tackling this problem impose constraints on the number of vertices
of each MBP to be enumerated, yet they are still not sufficient (e.g., they
require to specify the constraints, which is often not user-friendly, and
cannot control the number of MBPs to be enumerated directly). Therefore, in
this paper, we study the problem of finding $K$ MBPs with the most edges called
MaxBPs, where $K$ is a positive integral user parameter. The new proposal well
avoids the drawbacks of existing proposals. We formally prove the NP-hardness
of the problem. We then design two branch-and-bound algorithms, among which,
the better one called FastBB improves the worst-case time complexity to
$O^*(\gamma_k^ n)$, where $O^*$ suppresses the polynomials, $\gamma_k$ is a
real number that relies on $k$ and is strictly smaller than 2, and $n$ is the
number of vertices in the graph. For example, for $k=1$, $\gamma_k$ is equal to
$1.754$. We further introduce three techniques for boosting the performance of
the branch-and-bound algorithms, among which, the best one called PBIE can
further improve the time complexity to $O^*(\gamma_k^{d^3})$ for large sparse
graphs, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the graph. We conduct extensive
experiments on both real and synthetic datasets, and the results show that our
algorithm is up to four orders of magnitude faster than all baselines and
finding MaxBPs works better than finding all MBPs for a fraud detection

3-dimensional magnetic field structures which arise spontaneously, accelerate
ions and keep them moving in trajectories that repeatedly cross a dense and
warm plasma target. This is the origin of the abnormally high fusion reaction
rate of the plasma focus, which has been known since the 1960s but has begun to
be understood quite recently. Further progress now depends on explorations of
the global aspects of the evolution of poloidal magnetic field. However,
well-known experimental difficulties involved in standard techniques of axial

significant effort to avoid serious regression in software design. This is
because automotive software architects rely largely upon manual review of code

inefficient and prone to error. In recent days, neural language models
pre-trained on source code are beginning to be used for automating a variety of
programming tasks. In this work, we extend the application of such a
Programming Language Model (PLM) to automate the assessment of design
compliance. Using a PLM, we construct a system that assesses whether a set of
query programs comply with Controller-Handler, a design pattern specified to
ensure hardware abstraction in automotive control software. The assessment is
based upon measuring whether the geometrical arrangement of query program
embeddings, extracted from the PLM, aligns with that of a set of known
implementations of the pattern. The level of alignment is then transformed into
an interpretable measure of compliance. Using a controlled experiment, we
demonstrate that our technique determines compliance with a precision of 92%.
Also, using expert review to calibrate the automated assessment, we introduce a
protocol to determine the nature of the violation, helping eventual
refactoring. Results from this work indicate that neural language models can
provide valuable assistance to human architects in assessing and fixing

a unique template to understand Galactic nuclei. Nevertheless, the high
crowding and extinction towards the GC hamper the study of its main stellar
components, the nuclear stellar disc (NSD) and the nuclear star cluster (NSC).
Recent work has suggested that the NSD and the NSC can be distinguished along
the line of sight towards the NSC via the different extinction of their stars.
This motivated us to analyse the proper motion, radial velocity, and the
metallicity distributions of the different extinction groups. We use
photometric, kinematic, and metallicity data to distinguish between probable
NSD and NSC stars in a region centred on the NSC. We detected two different
extinction groups of stars and obtained significantly different proper motion
distributions for each of them, in agreement with the expected kinematics for
the NSD and the NSC. We derived radial velocity maps that appear to be
different for the NSD and the NSC. We also found different metallicities for
each of the components, with the largest one measured for the most extinguished
group of stars. We obtained that the metallicity distribution of each
extinction group is best fitted by a bimodal distribution, indicating the
presence of two metallicity components for each of them (a broad one slightly
below solar metallicity, and a more metal rich narrower one, that is largest
for the high extinction group of stars). We conclude that both extinction
groups are distinct GC components with different kinematics and metallicity,
and correspond to the NSD and the NSC. Therefore, it is possible to distinguish
them via their different extinction. The high mean metallicity,
$[M/H]\sim0.3$\,dex, obtained for the NSC metal rich stars, supports that the
NSC is arguabily the most metal rich region of the Galaxy.

In this work, we combine concepts from high-dimensional probability and
differential geometry to study how curvature properties in lower-dimensional
loss representations depend on those in the original loss space. We show that
saddle points in the original space are rarely correctly identified as such in
lower-dimensional representations if random projections are used. In such
projections, the expected curvature in a lower-dimensional representation is
proportional to the mean curvature in the original loss space. Hence, the mean
curvature in the original loss space determines if saddle points appear, on
average, as either minima, maxima, or almost flat regions. We use the
connection between expected curvature and mean curvature (i.e., the normalized
Hessian trace) to estimate the trace of Hessians without calculating the
Hessian or Hessian-vector products as in Hutchinson's method. Because random
projections are not able to correctly identify saddle information, we propose
to study projections along Hessian directions that are associated with the
largest and smallest principal curvatures. We connect our findings to the
ongoing debate on loss landscape flatness and generalizability. Finally, we
illustrate our method in numerical experiments on different image classifiers

TeV. The anti-baryon to baryon ratios are extremely important for the study of
baryon number transport mechanisms. These ratios help determine the carriers of
the baryon number and in the extraction of baryon structure information. Even
though all models show a good agreement between model simulations and data, the
ratios extracted from DPMJET-III model closely describes data at all energies.
It is observed that these ratios converge to unity for various model
predictions. This convergence also indicates that the anti-baryon to baryon
ratios follow the mass hierarchy, such that the hyperon specie containing more
strange quarks ({\alam /\lam} and {\axi / \xim}) approaches unity faster than
specie containing fewer strange quarks ($\overline{p}/p$). It is also observed
that the $\overline{B}/B$ ratio approaches unity more rapidly with the increase
in {\sqrts} energy. At lower energies we observe an excess production of
baryons over anti-baryons. However, this effect vanishes at higher energies due
to the baryon-anti-baryon pair production and the baryon-anti-baryon yield
becomes equal. Using model simulations, we additionally compute the asymmetry,
($A\equiv\frac{N_{p}-N_{\bar{p}}}N_{p}+N_{\bar{p}}}$) for protons. The
asymmetry shows a decreasing trend with increase in energy from 0.9 to 7 TeV
for all energies. This asymmetry trend is confirmed by model predictions at
{\sqrts} = 13.6 TeV which will help to put possible constraints on model
calculations at {\sqrts} = 13.6 TeV once the Run-III data for LHC becomes

common envelope evolution (CEE) where shortly before the CCSN explosion the RSG
progenitor interacts with a more compact companion that spirals-in and spins-up
the core. The companion can be a main sequence star, a neutron star, or a black

coupled, directed multi-agent networks that are subject to diffusion
performance. Inspired by the observation that the link redundancy in a network
may degrade its diffusion performance, a distributed data-driven neighbor
selection framework is proposed to adaptively adjust the network structure for
improving the diffusion performance of exogenous influence over the network.
Specifically, each agent is allowed to interact with only a specific subset of
neighbors while global reachability from exogenous influence to all agents of
the network is maintained. Both continuous-time and discrete-time directed
networks are examined. For each of the two cases, we first examine the
reachability properties encoded in the eigenvectors of perturbed variants of
graph Laplacian or SIA matrix associated with directed networks, respectively.
Then, an eigenvector-based rule for neighbor selection is proposed to derive a
reduced network, on which the diffusion performance is enhanced. Finally,
motivated by the necessity of distributed and data-driven implementation of the
neighbor selection rule, quantitative connections between eigenvectors of the
perturbed graph Laplacian and SIA matrix and relative rate of change in agent
state are established, respectively. These connections immediately enable a
data-driven inference of the reduced neighbor set for each agent using only
locally accessible data. As an immediate extension, we further discuss the
distributed data-driven construction of directed spanning trees of directed

An expert-delineated cohort of 35 planning CTs was used for training of an
nnU-net 3D-fullres/2D-ensemble model for autosegmentation of 20 different
HN_LNL. A second cohort acquired at the same institution later in time served

was compared to the average DL autosegmentation accuracy on the original and
recontoured set of expert segmentations. A postprocessing step to adjust
craniocaudal boundaries of level autosegmentations to the CT slice plane was

numerically lower (77.2 vs. 79.6,p=0.167) than manually drawn contours. DL
segmentations with CT slice plane adjustment were rated significantly better
than DL contours without slice plane adjustment (81.0 vs. 77.2,p=0.004).
Geometric accuracy of DL segmentations was not different from intraobserver

large-scale standardized autodelineation of HN_LNL in the research setting.

determine the fusion strategy. This paper proposes a map-based cooperative
perception framework, named map container, to improve the accuracy and
robustness of cooperative perception, which ultimately overcomes this problem.
The concept 'Map Container' denotes that the map serves as the platform to
transform all information into the map coordinate space automatically and
incorporate different sources of information in a distributed fusion
architecture. In the proposed map container, the GNSS signal and the matching
relationship between sensor feature and map feature are considered to optimize
the estimation of environment states. Evaluation on simulation dataset and

is an increasing need for strategies to assess their correct behavior. In
particular self-healing systems, which aim to provide resilience and
fault-tolerance, often deal with unanticipated failures in critical and highly
dynamic environments. Their reactive and complex behavior makes it challenging
to assess if these systems execute according to the desired goals. Recently,
several studies have expressed concern about the lack of systematic evaluation
methods for self-healing behavior.
  In this paper, we propose CHESS, an approach for the systematic evaluation of
self-adaptive and self-healing systems that builds on chaos engineering. Chaos
engineering is a methodology for subjecting a system to unexpected conditions
and scenarios. It has shown great promise in helping developers build resilient
microservice architectures and cyber-physical systems. CHESS turns this idea
around by using chaos engineering to evaluate how well a self-healing system
can withstand such perturbations. We investigate the viability of this approach
through an exploratory study on a self-healing smart office environment. The
study helps us explore the promises and limitations of the approach, as well as
identify directions where additional work is needed. We conclude with a summary
of lessons learned.

one often faces the difficulty in computing the normal form or the focus values
associated with generalized Hopf bifurcation, and the normal form with
unfolding for higher-codimension Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. The difficulty is
not only coming from the teadious symbolic computation of focus values, but
also due to the restriction on the system parameters, which frequently leads to
failure of the conventional approach used in the computation even for simple
$2$-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. In this paper, we use a simple
2-dimensional epidemic model, for which the conventional approach fails in
analyzing the stability of limit cycles arising from Hopf bifurcation, to
illustrate how our method can be efficiently applied to determine the
codimension of Hopf bifurcation. Further, we apply the simplest normal form
theory to consider codimension-3 Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation and present an
efficient one-step transformation approach, compared with the classical
six-step transformation approach to demonstrate the advantage of our method.

adjusting the volume flow rate of the cold air. Additionally, we introduced a
cooling model to relate the changes in skin temperature to various parameters
such as the cold air volume flow rate and distance from the cold air outlet to
the skin. For validation, we conducted measurement experiments and found that
our model can estimate the change in skin temperature with a root mean-square
error of 0.16 {\deg}C. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of a prototype
in psychophysical cold discrimination experiments based on the discrimination
threshold. Thus, cold sensations of varying intensities can be generated by
varying the parameters. These cold sensations can be combined with images,
sounds, and other stimuli to create an immersive and realistic artificial

absent due to extreme dominance of the EV interaction, we find the Gaussian

These factors can limit practical applications of the existing solutions. In
this paper, we present a methodology for the design of scalar-linear MPIR

impose any constraints on the minimum required size of the messages. Focusing
on the case of $N=D+1$, we show that when $D$ divides $K$, our scheme achieves
the capacity, where the capacity is defined as the maximum achievable download

scheme is the same or within a small additive margin compared to the best known
scheme that requires a high degree of subpacketization.

displacement machines as an expansion device. This is due to its high power to
weight ratio, compactness, lower noise, vibration, and potentially lower
specific cost making them a favourable choice over reciprocating expanders.
Admission in the expander chamber occurs through rotary valves fed with steam
supply from a boiler. The present study aims to investigate the magnitude of
pressure losses of the steam during intake and its effect on the net power
output of the expander over a range of rotational speed varying from 1200 to
3000 RPM. The thermodynamic analysis is carried out for the theoretical
pressure-volume cycle of the expander using Python, which is then used for CFD
analysis in Ansys Fluent 19.2. Three dimensional models are developed for the
flow domain stretching from the exit of the intake valve port to the port in
the rotor housing at different rotor angles ranging from admission to cutoff.
Computations are performed to investigate the associated pressure drop of steam
during admission. The boundary conditions at different rotor angles are
obtained from the thermodynamic model of the expander's theoretical
pressure-volume plot, and the state point values were obtained from the REFPROP
database. Validation of the CFD models are carried out by comparing pressure
drop values obtained through an analytical approach using correlations and
expressions reported in literature. A thorough performance analysis of this
expansion device is made and the loss in power output due to the intake
pressure loss is calculated. These losses during admission change the pressure
ratio across the actual expander designed for a given pressure ratio, leading
to a reduced power output by a reasonable margin of 20 to 30%. It is observed
that the percentage loss in power output increases with an increase in shaft
speed.

simulation results show that the estimation method based on tensor can achieve
performance close to CRLB and the estimation performance can be improved by
optimizing the transmit powers.

\begin{align*} \left|\sum_{j=1}^{n}\lambda_j^2\right|=\max_{1\leq j \leq
n}|\lambda_j|^2, \quad \forall \lambda_j \in \mathbb{K}, 1\leq j \leq n,
\forall n \in \mathbb{N}. \end{align*} For $d\in \mathbb{N}$, let
$\mathbb{K}^d$ be the standard $d$-dimensional non-Archimedean Hilbert space.
Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\text{Sym}^m(\mathbb{K}^d)$ be the non-Archimedean
Hilbert space of symmetric m-tensors. We prove the following result. If
$\{\tau_j\}_{j=1}^n$ is a collection in $\mathbb{K}^d$ satisfying $\langle
\tau_j, \tau_j\rangle =1$ for all $1\leq j \leq n$ and the operator
$\text{Sym}^m(\mathbb{K}^d)\ni x \mapsto \sum_{j=1}^n\langle x, \tau_j^{\otimes
m}\rangle \tau_j^{\otimes m} \in \text{Sym}^m(\mathbb{K}^d)$ is diagonalizable,
then \begin{align} (1) \quad \quad \quad \max_{1\leq j,k \leq n, j \neq
k}\{|n|, |\langle \tau_j, \tau_k\rangle|^{2m} \}\geq \frac{|n|^2}{\left|{d+m-1
\choose m}\right| }. \end{align} We call Inequality (1) as the non-Archimedean
version of Welch bounds obtained by Welch [\textit{IEEE Transactions on
Information Theory, 1974}]. We formulate non-Archimedean Zauner conjecture.
