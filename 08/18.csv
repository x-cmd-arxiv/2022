out-of-time-order correlation (OTOC) in the constant field Floquet system with
and without longitudinal field. In the calculation of OTOC, we take local spins
in longitudinal and transverse directions as observables which are local and
non-local in terms of Jordan-Wigner fermions, respectively. We use the exact
analytical solution of OTOC for the integrable model (without longitudinal
field term) with transverse direction spins as observables and numerical
solutions for other integrable and nonintegrable cases. OTOCs generated in both
cases depart from unity at a kick equal to the separation between the
observables when the local spins in the transverse direction and one additional
kick is required when the local spins in the longitudinal direction. The number
of kicks required to depart from unity depends on the separation between the
observables and is independent of the Floquet period and system size. In the
dynamic region, OTOCs show power-law growth in both models, the integrable
(without longitudinal field) as well as the nonintegrable (with longitudinal
field). The exponent of the power-law increases with increasing separation
between the observables. Near the saturation region, OTOCs grow linearly with a
very small rate.

differential operators on smooth tensor fields defined on closed Riemannian
submanifolds of Euclidean space, identified by randomly sampled point cloud
data. Theoretically, we establish the spectral convergence for the classical
pointwise RBF discrete non-symmetric approximation of Laplacians. Numerically,
we found that this formulation produces a very accurate estimation of leading
spectra with large enough data. When the manifolds are unknown, the error bound
of the pointwise operator estimation depends on the accuracy of the approximate
local tangent spaces. To improve this approximation accuracy, we develop a
second-order local SVD technique for estimating local tangent spaces on the
manifold. For robust manifold learning, we introduce a symmetric RBF discrete
approximation of the Laplacians induced by a weak formulation on appropriate
Hilbert spaces. Unlike the non-symmetric approximation, this formulation
guarantees non-negative real-valued spectra and the orthogonality of the
eigenvectors. Theoretically, we establish the convergence of the eigenpairs of
both the Laplace-Beltrami operator and Bochner Laplacian in the limit of large
data with convergence rates. Numerically, we provide supporting examples for
approximations of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and various vector Laplacians,
including the Bochner, Hodge, and Lichnerowicz Laplacians.

the combined heat and power system, an energy-grade double pricing mechanism is
proposed. Under the pricing mechanism, the resulting merchandise surplus of the

interpretable parts and its revenue adequacy can be guaranteed for all heat

merchandise surplus is composed of non-negative components at each electricity

for us to generalize a supervised model to other domains with different data

\textit{LAMA-Net}, an encoder-decoder based model (Transformer) with an induced

comparators -- or, in other words, the number of inputs that can be sorted at

parameters -- $n$, the number of inputs, and $d$, the depth.
  This model received considerable attention. Partly, its motivation is to
better understand the structure of sorting networks. In particular, sorting
networks with large arity are related to recursive constructions of ordinary
sorting networks. Additionally, studies of this model have natural
correspondence with a recent line of work on constructing circuits for majority
functions from majority gates of lower fan-in.
  Motivated by these questions, we obtain the first lower bounds on the arity
of constant-depth sorting networks. More precisely, we consider sorting
networks of depth $d$ up to 4, and determine the minimal $k$ for which there is
such a network with comparators of arity $k$. For depths $d=1,2$ we observe
that $k=n$. For $d=3$ we show that $k = \lceil \frac n2 \rceil$. For $d=4$ the
minimal arity becomes sublinear: $k = \Theta(n^{2/3})$. This contrasts with the

nanomechanical beam with a first flexure resonating at 3.8MHz, cooled down to
temperatures in the range from 100mK to 400mK. The technique is constructed
around a microwave opto-mechanical setup using a cryogenic High Electron
Mobility Transistor, and is based on two parametric amplifications implemented
in series: an in-built opto-mechanical 'blue-detuned' pumping plus a Traveling
Wave Parametric Amplifier stage. We demonstrate our ability to resolve energy
fluctuations of the mechanical mode in real-time up to the fastest relevant
speed given by the mechanical relaxation rate. The energy probability
distribution is then exponential, matching the expected Boltzmann distribution.
The variance of fluctuations is found to be $(k_B T)^2$ with no free
parameters. Our microwave detection floor is about 3 Standard Quantum Limit at
6GHz; the resolution of our fastest acquisition tracks reached about 100
phonons, and is related to the rather poor opto-mechanical coupling of the

regime, but shall be extended to the quantum case in the future with systems
presenting a much larger $g_0$ (up to $2\pi\times 250~$Hz), potentially
reaching the resolution of a single mechanical quantum. We believe that it will

is important to answer why the change occurred: which inputs caused the change
in metric? A key component of such an attribution question is estimating the
counterfactual: the (hypothetical) change in the system metric due to a
specified change in a single input. However, due to inherent stochasticity and
complex interactions between parts of the system, it is difficult to model an
output metric directly. We utilize the computational structure of a system to
break up the modelling task into sub-parts, such that each sub-part corresponds
to a more stable mechanism that can be modelled accurately over time. Using the
system's structure also helps to view the metric as a computation over a
structural causal model (SCM), thus providing a principled way to estimate
counterfactuals. Specifically, we propose a method to estimate counterfactuals
using time-series predictive models and construct an attribution score,
CF-Shapley, that is consistent with desirable axioms for attributing an
observed change in the output metric. Unlike past work on causal shapley
values, our proposed method can attribute a single observed change in output
(rather than a population-level effect) and thus provides more accurate
attribution scores when evaluated on simulated datasets. As a real-world
application, we analyze a query-ad matching system with the goal of attributing
observed change in a metric for ad matching density. Attribution scores explain
how query volume and ad demand from different query categories affect the ad
matching density, leading to actionable insights and uncovering the role of
external events (e.g., ""Cheetah Day"") in driving the matching density.

apply supervised depth estimation to surgical applications. As an alternative,
self-supervised methods have been introduced to train depth estimators using
only synchronized stereo image pairs. However, most recent work focused on the
left-right consistency in 2D and ignored valuable inherent 3D information on
the object in real world coordinates, meaning that the left-right 3D geometric
structural consistency is not fully utilized. To overcome this limitation, we
present M3Depth, a self-supervised depth estimator to leverage 3D geometric
structural information hidden in stereo pairs while keeping monocular

using natural language processing methods helps to battle against information

requires a model to understand, abstract, and generate clinical documentation.
In this work, we propose a new NLP task that aims to generate a list of
problems in a patient's daily care plan using input from the provider's
progress notes during hospitalization. We investigate the performance of T5 and
BART, two state-of-the-art seq2seq transformer architectures, in solving this
problem. We provide a corpus built on top of progress notes from publicly
available electronic health record progress notes in the Medical Information
Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III. T5 and BART are trained on general domain
text, and we experiment with a data augmentation method and a domain adaptation
pre-training method to increase exposure to medical vocabulary and knowledge.
Evaluation methods include ROUGE, BERTScore, cosine similarity on sentence
embedding, and F-score on medical concepts. Results show that T5 with domain
adaptive pre-training achieves significant performance gains compared to a
rule-based system and general domain pre-trained language models, indicating a
promising direction for tackling the problem summarization task.

truncated singular value decomposition (t-SVD) for heterogeneous (CPU+GPU) high
performance computing (HPC) systems. Various implementations of SVD have been
proposed, but most only estimate the singular values as an estimation of the
singular vectors which can significantly increase the time and memory
complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an implementation of SVD
based on the power method, which is a truncated singular values and singular
vectors estimation method. Memory utilization bottlenecks seen in the power
method are typically associated with the computation of the Gram matrix
$\mat{A}^T\mat{A}$, which can be significant when $\mat{A}$ is large and dense,
or when $\mat{A}$ is super-large and sparse. The proposed implementation is
optimized for out-of-memory problems where the memory required to factorize a
given matrix is greater than the available GPU memory. We reduce the memory
complexity of $\mat{A}^T\mat{A}$ by using a batching strategy where the
intermediate factors are computed block by block. We also suppress I/O latency
associated with both host-to-device (H2D) and device-to-host (D2H) batch copies
by overlapping each batch copy with compute using CUDA streams. Furthermore, we
use optimized \textit{NCCL} based communicators to reduce the latency
associated with collective communications (both intra-node and inter-node). In
addition, sparse and dense matrix multiplications are significantly accelerated
with GPU cores (or tensors cores when available), resulting in an
implementation with good scaling. We demonstrate the scalability of our
distributed out of core SVD algorithm to successfully decompose dense matrix of
size 1TB and sparse matrix of size 128PB with 1e-6 sparsity.

small noise, based on minimizing the Freidlin-Wentzell action functional under
appropriate boundary conditions, can be obtained by integrating certain matrix
Riccati differential equations along the large deviation minimizers or
instantons, either forward or backward in time. Previous works in this
direction often rely on the existence of isolated minimizers with positive
definite second variation. By adopting techniques from field theory and
explicitly evaluating the large deviation prefactors as functional determinant
ratios using Forman's theorem, we extend the approach to general systems where
degenerate submanifolds of minimizers exist. The key technique for this is a
boundary-type regularization of the second variation operator. This extension
is particularly relevant if the system possesses continuous symmetries that are
broken by the instantons. We find that removing the vanishing eigenvalues
associated with the zero modes is possible within the Riccati formulation and
amounts to modifying the initial or final conditions and evaluation of the
Riccati matrices. We apply our results in multiple examples including a

quantum materials, influenced strongly by competing interactions and/or
geometric frustration, are particularly susceptible to such ordering phenomena
and thus offer fertile ground for understanding the consequent emergent
collective quantum phenomena. Such is the case of the quasi-2D materials
R4Ni3O10(R=La, Pr), in which intertwined charge-and spin-density waves (CDW and
SDW) on the Ni sublattice have been identified and characterized. Not
unexpectedly, these density waves are largely 2D as a result of weak coupling
between planes, compounded with magnetic frustration. In the case of R=Pr,
however, we show here that exchange coupling between the transition metal and
rare earth sublattices upon cooling overcomes both obstacles, leading to a
dimensional crossover into a fully 3D ordered and coupled SDW state on both
sublattices, as an induced moment on notionally nonmagnetic Pr3+ opens exchange
pathways in the third dimension. In the process, the structure of the SDW on
the Ni sublattice is irreversibly altered, an effect that survives reheating of
the material until the underlying CDW melts. This 'bootstrapping' mechanism
linking incommensurate SDWs on the two sublattices illustrates a new member of
the multitude of quantum states that low-dimensional magnets can express,
driven by coupled orders and modulated by frustrated exchange pathways.

network service, not needing fully reliable data transport and/or their
fair-share of network bandwidth. This opens up opportunities for superior
network and infrastructure multiplexing by having this flexible traffic cede
capacity under congestion to regular traffic with stricter needs. We posit
there is opportunity in network service primitives which permit degradation
within certain bounds, such that flexible traffic still receives an acceptable
level of service, while benefiting from its weaker requirements. We propose two
primitives, namely guaranteed partial delivery and bounded deprioritization. We
design a budgeting algorithm to provide guarantees relative to their fair
share, which is measured via probing. The requirement of budgeting and probing
limits the algorithm's applicability to large flexible flows.
  We evaluate our algorithm with large flexible flows and for three workloads
of regular flows of small size, large size and a distribution of sizes. Across
the workloads, our algorithm achieves less speed-up of regular flows than fixed
prioritization, especially for the small flows workload (1.25x vs. 6.82 in the
99th %-tile). Our algorithm provides better guarantees in the workload with
large regular flows (with 14.5% vs. 32.5% of flexible flows being slowed down
beyond their guarantee). However, it provides not much better or even slightly
worse guarantees for the other two workloads. The ability to enforce guarantees
is influenced by flow fair share interdependence, measurement inaccuracies and
dependency on convergence. We observe that priority changes to probe or to
deprioritize causes queue shifts which deteriorate guarantees and limit
possible speed-up, especially of small flows. We find that mechanisms to both
prioritize traffic and track guarantees should be as non-disruptive as
possible.

isochorically ($\phi=0.7$) and instantaneously to different temperatures $T_f$
above and below the glass transition. For this, we combine extensive Brownian
dynamics simulations and theoretical calculations based on the non-equilibrium
self-consistent generalized Langevin equation (NE-SCGLE) theory. The response
of the liquid to a quench generally consists of a sub-linear increase of the
$\alpha$-relaxation time with system's age. Approaching the ideal
glass-transition temperature from above ($T_f>T^a$) sub-aging appears as a
transient process describing a broad equilibration crossover for quenches to
nearly arrested states. This allows us to empirically determine an
equilibration timescale $t^{eq}(T_f)$ that becomes increasingly longer as $T_f$
approaches $T^a$. For quenches inside the glass ($T_f\leq T^a$) the growth rate
of the structural relaxation time becomes progressively larger as $T_f$
decreases and, unlike the equilibration scenario, $\tau_{\alpha}$ remains
evolving within the whole observation time-window.These features are
consistently found in theory and simulations with remarkable semi-quantitative
agreement, and coincide with those revealed in the similar and complementary
exercise [Phys. Rev. {\bf 96}, 022608 (2017)] that considered a sequence of
quenches with fixed final temperature $T_f=0$ but increasing $\phi$ towards the
hard-sphere dynamical arrest volume fraction $\phi^a_{HS}=0.582$. The NE-SCGLE
analysis, however, unveils various fundamental aspects of the glass transition,
involving the abrupt passage from the ordinary equilibration scenario to the
persistent aging effects that are characteristic of glass-forming liquids. The
theory also explains that, within the time window of any experimental

ColorCNN+ achieves very competitive results under most circumstances,
preserving both key structures for network recognition and visual fidelity with

with the internal kinematics. Using the hydrodynamical cosmological simulation
Magneticum Pathfinder, we identify tidal tails, shells, streams, and satellite
planes, and connect their existence to the amount of rotational support and the
formation histories of the host galaxies. This presents the first combined
statistical census considering all those four types of features in
hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Tidal features are visually classified
from a 3D rendering of the simulated galaxies by several scientists. The
results are compared to observations, especially from the MATLAS survey.
Prominent features are more common around elliptical than around disk galaxies.
Shells are preferentially found around kinematically slowly rotating galaxies
in both simulations and observations, while streams only have a slight
preference to be present around slowly rotating galaxies. Tails and satellite
planes appear independently of the internal kinematics of the central galaxy,
indicating that they are formed through processes that have not (yet) affected
the internal kinematics. As shells are formed through radial merger events
while streams are remnants of circular merger infall, this suggests that the
orbital angular momentum of the merger event plays a more crucial role in
transforming the host galaxy than previously anticipated. The existence of
shells around slow rotators is further a sign of a radial merger formation for
the particular slow rotators, as a third of the galaxies with a shell were
transformed into slow rotators by the merger event that also caused the shells.

singular at quantum critical points, reflecting the fact they make
qualitatively different scale-invariant predictions when compared to other
theories in the family. However, such singularities are always at finite
distance. The goal of this paper is to study infinite distance metric
singularities and understand what type of physics generates them. We argue that
infinite distance limits in the information metric correspond to theories in
which expectation values factorize, and that unitarity restricts the asymptotic
form of the metric to have a universal logarithmic singularity whose
coefficient only depends on how the factorization limit is approached. We
illustrate this relationship in a set of wide-ranging examples. Furthermore, we
argue that it provides a particularly simple bottom-up motivation for the
seemingly universal behavior of quantum gravity in asymptotic regions of moduli
space described by the Swampland Distance Conjecture: gravity universally
couples to stress-energy and thus abhors factorization limits. The towers of
light fields that appear in these limits in so many examples serve to decouple
gravity and consistently allow for factorization. We make this more precise via
holography and suggest a way to consistently realize infinite distance limits

conventional fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) in two-dimensional (2D)
electron gases. They typically arise in a 2D lattice without time-reversal
symmetry when a nearly flat Bloch band with nonzero Chern number is partially
occupied by strongly interacting particles. Band topology and interactions
endow FCIs exotic topological orders which are characterized by the precisely
quantized Hall conductance, robust ground-state degeneracy on high-genus
manifolds, and fractionalized quasiparticles. Since in principle FCIs can exist
at zero magnetic field and be protected by a large energy gap, they provide a
potentially experimentally more accessible avenue for observing and harnessing
FQHE phenomena. Moreover, the interplay between FCIs and lattice-specific
effects that do not exist in the conventional continuum FQHE poses new
theoretical challenges. In this chapter, we provide a general introduction of
the theoretical model and numerical simulation of FCIs, then pay special
attention on the recent development of this field in moir\'e materials while
also commenting on potential alternative implementations in cold atom systems.
With a plethora of exciting theoretical and experimental progress, topological
flat bands in moir\'e materials such as magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene on
hexagonal boron nitride have indeed turned out to be a remarkably versatile
platform for FCIs featuring an intriguing interplay between topology, geometry,
and interactions.

shows a broad-band spectrum extending from radio to X-rays whose luminosity
cannot be explained by thermal emission from the system components alone, and
is instead explained through synchrotron emission powered by the spin-down of
the white dwarf. We analysed NTT/ULTRACAM, TNT/ULTRASPEC, and GTC/HiPERCAM

a precise estimate of the spin frequency derivative, now confirmed with
50-sigma significance. Using archival photometry, we show that the spin down
rate of P/Pdot = 5.6e6 years has remained constant since 2005. As well as
employing the method of pulse-arrival time fitting used for previous estimates,
we also found a consistent value via traditional Fourier analysis for the first
time. In addition, we obtained optical time-resolved spectra with WHT/ISIS and
VLT/X-shooter. We performed modulated Doppler tomography for the first time for
the system, finding evidence of emission modulated on the orbital period. We
have also estimated the projected rotational velocity of the M-dwarf as a
function of orbital period and found that it must be close to Roche lobe
filling. Our findings provide further constraints for modelling this unique

planetesimals. Nonetheless, this process has been found in previous studies to
require either a dust-to-gas surface density ratio or a dust size that is
enhanced compared to observed values. Employing two-dimensional global
simulations of protoplanetary disks, we show that the vertical shear
instability and the streaming instability in concert can cause dust
concentration that is sufficient for planetesimal formation for lower surface
density ratios and smaller dust sizes than the streaming instability in
isolation, and in particular under conditions that are consistent with
observational constraints. This is because dust overdensities forming in
pressure bumps induced by the vertical shear instability act as seeds for the
streaming instability and are enhanced by it. While our two-dimensional model
does not include self-gravity, we find that strong dust clumping and the
formation (and dissolution) of gravitationally unstable overdensities can be
robustly inferred from the evolution of the maximum or the mean dust-to-gas
volume density ratio. The vertical shear instability puffs up the dust layer to
an average mid-plane dust-to-gas density ratio that is significantly below
unity. We therefore find that reaching a mid-plane density ratio of one is not
necessary to trigger planetesimal formation via the streaming instability when
it acts in unison with the vertical shear instability.

of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) has been to derive the eigenvalue statistics of
matrices drawn from a given distribution. The Wigner approach gives powerful
insights into the properties of complex, chaotic systems in thermal
equilibrium. Another Hungarian, Cornelius Lanczos, suggested a method of
reducing the dynamics of any quantum system to a one-dimensional chain by
tridiagonalizing the Hamiltonian relative to a given initial state. In the
resulting matrix, the diagonal and off-diagonal Lanczos coefficients control
transition amplitudes between elements of a distinguished basis of states. We
connect these two approaches to the quantum mechanics of complex systems by
deriving analytical formulae relating the potential defining a general RMT, or,
equivalently, its density of states, to the Lanczos coefficients and their
correlations. In particular, we derive an integral relation between the average
Lanczos coefficients and the density of states, and, for polynomial potentials,
algebraic equations that determine the Lanczos coefficients from the potential.
We obtain these results for generic initial states in the thermodynamic limit.
As an application, we compute the time-dependent ``spread complexity'' in
Thermo-Field Double states and the spectral form factor for Gaussian and
Non-Gaussian RMTs.

the wormhole-type correlations are associated with different phases and add up
to zero in two replica quantities. Correspondingly, when we consider the JT
gravity with $n$ different asymptotic boundaries each of which has $k$
degenerate vacua, the transition between different vacua introduces an extra
factor in the transition amplitude between different boundaries. It is shown
that similar to the SYK model, the extra factors ensure that all the bulk
geometries connecting different boundaries cancel each other in the
gravitational path integral. The symmetry responsible for the degenerate vacua
is also related to a discrete symmetry of the SYK model. We further show that
specifying the boundary vacua or gauging the symmetry can be regarded as the
origin of the factorization puzzle. Moreover, we propose a bulk dual

of black hole conservative tidal responses (Love numbers), dissipation numbers,
and their spin-0 and spin-1 analogs. In the first part of this paper we show
how the EFT allows us to circumvent the source/response ambiguity without
having to use the analytic continuation prescription. The source/response
ambiguity appears if Post-Newtonian (PN)corrections to external sources overlap
with the response. However, these PN corrections can be clearly identified and
isolated using the EFT. We illustrate that by computing static one-point
functions of various external fields perturbing the four-dimensional
Schwarzschild geometry. Upon resumming all relevant Feynman diagrams, we find
that the PN terms that may mimic the response actually vanish for static black
holes. Thus, the extraction of Love numbers from matching the EFT and general
relativity (GR) calculations is completely unambiguous, and it implies that the
Love numbers vanish identically for all types of perturbations. We also study
in detail another type of fine tuning in the EFT, the absence of Love numbers'
running. We show that logarithmic corrections to Love numbers do stem from
individual loop diagrams in generic gauges, but cancel after all diagrams are
summed over. In the particular cases of spin-0 and spin-2 fields the logarithms
are completely absent if one uses the Kaluza-Klein metric decomposition. In the
second part of the paper we compute frequency-dependent dissipative response
contributions to the one-point functions using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism.

  Evolution of X-line Structures in a Collisionless Plasma","8 pages, 9 figures. Submitted to Physics of Plasmas",,,,"physics.plasm-ph physics.comp-ph physics.space-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The efficiency of energy conversion during magnetic reconnection is related
to the reconnection rate. While the stable reconnection rate has been studied
extensively, its growth between the time of reconnection onset and the peak
reconnection rate has not been thoroughly discussed. We use a 2D
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation to examine how the non-ideal reconnection
electric field evolves during the growth process and how it relates to changes
near the x-line. We identify three phases of growth: 1) slow quasi-linear
growth, 2) rapid exponential growth, and 3) tapered growth followed by negative
growth after the reconnection rate peaks. Through analysis of the structural
changes of the EDR, we associate the early phases with the breaking of x-line
symmetry through the erosion of the pre-onset bipolar Ez and the emergence of a
diverging Ex pattern at the neutral line in phase 1 followed by the expansion
of the inflow region and the enhancement of inflow Poynting flux Sz associated
with the out-of-plane electric field Ey in phase 2. We show how the Hall fields
facilitate rapid growth in phase 2 by opening up the exhaust, relieving the
electron-scale bottleneck and allowing large Poynting flux across the
separatrices. We find that the rapid inflow of electromagnetic energy
accumulates until the downstream electromagnetic energy density in phase 3
approaches the initial upstream asymptotic value. Finally, we examine how the
electron outflow and the downstream ion populations interact in phase 3 and how
each species exchanges energy with the local field structures in the exhaust.

extremely heavy-tailed (i.e., infinite mean) Pareto losses is larger than a
standalone loss in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance. This result
is further generalized to Pareto risks in the context of negative dependence,
convex transformations, random summation and weights, and losses triggered by
catastrophic events. We discuss several implications of these results via an
equilibrium analysis in a risk exchange market. First, diversification of
extremely heavy-tailed Pareto losses increases portfolio risk, and thus a
diversification penalty exists. Second, agents with extremely heavy-tailed
Pareto losses will not share risks in a market equilibrium. Third, transferring
losses from agents bearing Pareto losses to external parties without any losses
may arrive at an equilibrium which benefits every party involved. The empirical
studies show that our new inequality can be observed empirically for real
datasets that fit well with extremely heavy tails.

this paper, we report the identification of A2744-DSG-$z3$, a dusty, multiarm
spiral galaxy at $z=3.059$ using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRISS
imaging and grism spectroscopy. A2744-DSG-$z3$ was discovered as a
gravitationally lensed sub-millimeter galaxy with ALMA. This is the most
distant stellar spiral structure seen thus far, consistent with cosmological
simulations which suggest $z\approx3$ as the epoch when spirals emerge. Thanks
to the gravitational lensing and excellent spatial resolution of JWST, the
spiral arms are resolved with a spatial resolution of $\approx290$\,pc. Based
on SED fitting, the spiral galaxy has a de-lensed star formation rate of
$85\pm30 \ M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and a stellar mass of $\approx10^{10.6}\
M_{\odot}$, indicating that A2744-DSG-$z3$ is a main-sequence galaxy. After
fitting the spiral arms, we find a stellar effective radius ($R_{e,
\rm{star}}$) of $5.0\pm1.5$ kpc. Combing with ALMA measurements, we find that
the effective radii ratio between dust and stars is $\approx0.4$, similar to
{those} of massive SFGs at $z\sim2$, indicating a compact dusty core in
A2744-DSG-$z3$. Moreover, this galaxy appears to be living in a group
environment: including A2744-DSG-$z3$, at least three galaxies at $z=3.05 -
3.06$ {are} spectroscopically confirmed by JWST/NIRISS and ALMA, residing
within a lensing-corrected projected scale of $\approx 70$ kpc. This, along
with the asymmetric brightness profile, further suggests that the spiral arms
may be triggered by minor merger events at $z\gtrsim3$.

when locating final destinations or targeting specific objects in unfamiliar

a target object, approaching the final target from one's present position is
often frustrating and challenging, especially when one drifts away from the
initial planned path to avoid obstacles. In this paper, we develop a novel
wearable navigation solution to provide real-time guidance for a user to
approach a target object of interest efficiently and effectively in unfamiliar

target object localization in 3D and continuous estimation of the user's
trajectory, both based on the 2D video captured by a low-cost monocular camera
mounted on in front of the chest of the user. These functions enable the system
to suggest an initial navigation path, continuously update the path as the user
moves, and offer timely recommendation about the correction of the user's path.
Our experiments demonstrate that our system is able to operate with an error of
less than 0.5 meter both outdoor and indoor. The system is entirely
vision-based and does not need other sensors for navigation, and the
computation can be run with the Jetson processor in the wearable system to
facilitate real-time navigation assistance.

under convective flow conditions. The evaporation behavior of a freely
deforming droplet of single component jet fuel surrogate, n-decane, is
investigated by varying Weber number ($We$) from $1-12$ and Reynolds number
($Re$) from $25$ to $120$ under high-pressure environment. These studies
utilize interface capturing Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). To validate the
accuracy of the solver, the results are compared against correlations by
Abramzon and Sirignano (Int. Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 1989) and are
found to be in good agreement with maximum difference of $5 \%$. The results
suggest a weak dependency of total evaporation rate ($\dot{m}$) on Weber number
at low $Re$ flow. However, a strong correlation is seen between total
evaporation rate and $We$ at high $Re$. $20 \%$ enhancement in $\dot{m}$ is
observed at $We=12$ (highly deformed shape) when compared to $We=1$ at
$Re=120$.
  In these cases, the distribution of local evaporation flux on droplet is
found to be proportional to its curvature up to the point of flow separation
which agrees with low $Re$ theories on droplet evaporation by Tonini and
Cossalli (International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 2013), Palmore
(Journal of Heat Transfer 2022). Beyond the flow separation point, evaporation
flux distribution depends on the boundary layer development and flow evolution
downstream of the droplet. For highly deformed droplets, larger wake region
creates favorable fuel vapor gradients and promotes mixing in droplet wake,
hence higher evaporation flux.

from the observations to latent states) based on data generated under a fixed

rate for estimating this function and present an algorithm approaching this
fundamental limit. In turn, our algorithm also provides estimates of all the
components of the MDP. We then study the problem of learning near-optimal
policies in the reward-free framework. Based on our efficient model estimation
algorithm, we show that we can infer a policy converging (as the number of
collected samples grows large) to the optimal policy at the best possible rate.
Interestingly, our analysis provides necessary and sufficient conditions under
which exploiting the block structure yields improvements in the sample
complexity for identifying near-optimal policies. When these conditions are
met, the sample complexity in the minimax reward-free setting is improved by a
multiplicative factor $n$, where $n$ is the number of possible contexts.

performance, and understanding scaling laws is essential for strategic planning
for a sustainable model quality performance growth, long-term resource planning
and developing efficient system infrastructures to support large-scale models.
In this paper, we study empirical scaling laws for DLRM style recommendation
models, in particular Click-Through Rate (CTR). We observe that model quality
scales with power law plus constant in model size, data size and amount of
compute used for training. We characterize scaling efficiency along three
different resource dimensions, namely data, parameters and compute by comparing
the different scaling schemes along these axes. We show that parameter scaling
is out of steam for the model architecture under study, and until a
higher-performing model architecture emerges, data scaling is the path forward.
The key research questions addressed by this study include: Does a
recommendation model scale sustainably as predicted by the scaling laws? Or are
we far off from the scaling law predictions? What are the limits of scaling?
What are the implications of the scaling laws on long-term hardware/system
development?

  Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Data",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning (FL) has received a surge of interest in recent years
thanks to its benefits in data privacy protection, efficient communication, and
parallel data processing. Also, with appropriate algorithmic designs, one could
achieve the desirable linear speedup for convergence effect in FL. However,
most existing works on FL are limited to systems with i.i.d. data and
centralized parameter servers and results on decentralized FL with
heterogeneous datasets remains limited. Moreover, whether or not the linear
speedup for convergence is achievable under fully decentralized FL with data
heterogeneity remains an open question. In this paper, we address these
challenges by proposing a new algorithm, called NET-FLEET, for fully
decentralized FL systems with data heterogeneity. The key idea of our algorithm
is to enhance the local update scheme in FL (originally intended for
communication efficiency) by incorporating a recursive gradient correction
technique to handle heterogeneous datasets. We show that, under appropriate
parameter settings, the proposed NET-FLEET algorithm achieves a linear speedup
for convergence. We further conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate
the performance of the proposed NET-FLEET algorithm and verify our theoretical
findings.

such as biomedical image reconstruction and non-destructive testing. These
problems are characterized by the sensitivity of direct solution methods with
respect to data perturbations. To stabilize the reconstruction process,
regularization methods have to be employed. Well-known regularization methods
are based on frame expansions, such as the wavelet-vaguelette (WVD)
decomposition, which are well adapted to the underlying signal class and the
forward model and furthermore allow efficient implementation. However, it is
well known that the lack of translational invariance of wavelets and related
systems leads to specific artifacts in the reconstruction. To overcome this

diagonal frame decomposition (TI-DFD) of linear operators as a novel concept
generalizing the SVD. We characterize ill-posedness via the TI-DFD and prove
that a TI-DFD combined with a regularizing filter leads to a convergent
regularization method with optimal convergence rates. As illustrative example,
we construct a wavelet-based TI-DFD for one-dimensional integration, where we
also investigate our approach numerically. The results indicate that filtered
TI-DFDs eliminate the typical wavelet artifacts when using standard wavelets
and provide a fast, accurate, and stable solution scheme for inverse problems.

Therefore, the models we develop for various tasks should be robust to such
kinds of noisy data, which led to the thriving field of robust machine
learning. We consider this important issue in the setting of automatic speech
recognition. With the increasing popularity of pre-trained models, it's an

large-scale structures using quasars as direct tracers of dark matter in the
redshift range 0.9<z<2.1 and using Ly-alpha forests in quasar spectra at z>2.1.
We present several methods to select candidate quasars for DESI, using input
photometric imaging in three optical bands (g, r, z) from the DESI Legacy
Imaging Surveys and two infrared bands (W1, W2) from the Wide-field Infrared
Explorer (WISE). These methods were extensively tested during the Survey
Validation of DESI. In this paper, we report on the results obtained with the
different methods and present the selection we optimized for the DESI main
survey. The final quasar target selection is based on a Random Forest algorithm
and selects quasars in the magnitude range 16.5<r<23. Visual selection of
ultra-deep observations indicates that the main selection consists of 71%
quasars, 16% galaxies, 6% stars and 7% inconclusive spectra. Using the spectra
based on this selection, we build an automated quasar catalog that achieves a
>99% purity for a nominal effective exposure time of ~1000s. With a 310 per sq.
deg. target density, the main selection allows DESI to select more than 200
QSOs per sq. deg. (including 60 quasars with z>2.1), exceeding the project
requirements by 20%. The redshift distribution of the selected quasars is in
excellent agreement with quasar luminosity function predictions.

fainter $19.5 < r < 20.175$ sample, color-selected to have high redshift
efficiency (BGS Faint); and a smaller low-z quasar sample. BGS will observe
these targets using exposure times, scaled to achieve uniform completeness, and
visit each point on the footprint three times. We use observations from the
Survey Validation programs conducted prior to the main survey along with
realistic simulations to show that BGS can complete its strategy and make
optimal use of `bright' time. We demonstrate that BGS targets have stellar
contamination <1% and that their densities do not depend strongly on imaging
properties. We also confirm that BGS Bright will achieve >80% fiber assignment

redshift success rates with no significant dependence on observing conditions.
BGS meets the requirements for an extensive range of scientific applications.
BGS will yield the most precise Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Redshift-Space

exploit new methods that require highly complete and dense galaxy samples (e.g.
N-point statistics, multi-tracers). BGS further provides a powerful tool to
study galaxy populations and the relations between galaxies and dark matter.

standard pipeline to create a modified pipeline to improve the overall quasar

good-redshift purity (reliable redshifts measured within 3000 km/s) of ~99%;
however, the modified pipeline recovers ~94% of the visually inspected quasars,

some quasars are missed by the standard spectroscopic pipeline and find that
they are more host-galaxy dominated (i.e., distant analogs of ""Seyfert

show example spectra to demonstrate the overall diversity of the DESI quasar

robotics. Given a ground-level color image and a satellite patch that contains
the local surroundings, the task is to identify the location of the ground
camera within the satellite patch. Related work addressed this task for
range-sensors (LiDAR, Radar), but for vision, only as a secondary regression
step after an initial cross-view image retrieval step. Since the local
satellite patch could also be retrieved through any rough localization prior
(e.g. from GPS/GNSS, temporal filtering), we drop the image retrieval objective
and focus on the metric localization only. We devise a novel network
architecture with denser satellite descriptors, similarity matching at the
bottleneck (rather than at the output as in image retrieval), and a dense
spatial distribution as output to capture multi-modal localization ambiguities.
We compare against a state-of-the-art regression baseline that uses global
image descriptors. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on the
recently proposed VIGOR and the Oxford RobotCar datasets validate our design.
The produced probabilities are correlated with localization accuracy, and can
even be used to roughly estimate the ground camera's heading when its
orientation is unknown. Overall, our method reduces the median metric
localization error by 51%, 37%, and 28% compared to the state-of-the-art when
generalizing respectively in the same area, across areas, and across time.

pyramid wavefront sensor, for example, have large dynamic range or high
sensitivity, trading one regime for the other. A new type of wavefront sensor
is being developed and is currently undergoing testing at the University of
Arizona's Center for Astronomical Adaptive Optics. This sensor builds on linear
optical differentiation theory by using linear, spatially varying halfwave
plates in an intermediate focal plane. These filters, along with the polarizing
beam splitters, divide the beam into four pupil images, similar to those
produced by the pyramid wavefront sensor. The wavefront is then reconstructed
from the local wavefront slope information contained in these images. The ODWFS
is ideally suited for wavefront sensing on extended objects because of its
large dynamic range and because it operates in a pupil plane which allows for
on chip resampling even for arbitrarily shaped sources. We have assembled the
ODWFS on a testbed using 32 by 32 square 1000 actuator deformable mirror to
introduce aberration into a simulated telescope beam. We are currently testing
the system's spatial frequency response and are comparing the resulting data to
numerical simulations. This paper presents the results of these initial
experiments.

extrapolating results of a sequence of finite-system-size simulations to the
thermodynamic limit. In the quantum Monte Carlo community, twist-averaging was
pioneered as an efficient strategy to eliminate one-body finite size effects.
In the dynamical mean field community, cluster generalizations of the dynamical
mean field theory were formulated to study systems with non-local correlations.
In this work, we put the twist-averaging and the dynamical cluster
approximation variant of the dynamical mean field theory onto equal footing,
discuss commonalities and differences, and compare results from both techniques
to the standard periodic boundary technique. At the example of Hubbard-type
models with local, short-range and Yukawa-like longer range interactions we
show that all methods converge to the same limit, but that the convergence
speed differs in practice. We show that embedding theories are an effective
tool for managing both one-body and two-body finite size effects, in particular
if interactions are averaged over twist angles.

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2004.11138",,,,"cs.CR cs.AI cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Social engineering (SE) is a form of deception that aims to trick people into
giving access to data, information, networks and even money. For decades SE has
been a key method for attackers to gain access to an organization, virtually
skipping all lines of defense. Attackers also regularly use SE to scam innocent
people by making threatening phone calls which impersonate an authority or by
sending infected emails which look like they have been sent from a loved one.
SE attacks will likely remain a top attack vector for criminals because humans
are the weakest link in cyber security.
  Unfortunately, the threat will only get worse now that a new technology
called deepfakes as arrived. A deepfake is believable media (e.g., videos)
created by an AI. Although the technology has mostly been used to swap the
faces of celebrities, it can also be used to `puppet' different personas.
Recently, researchers have shown how this technology can be deployed in
real-time to clone someone's voice in a phone call or reenact a face in a video
call. Given that any novice user can download this technology to use it, it is
no surprise that criminals have already begun to monetize it to perpetrate
their SE attacks.
  In this paper, we propose a lightweight application which can protect
organizations and individuals from deepfake SE attacks. Through a challenge and
response approach, we leverage the technical and theoretical limitations of
deepfake technologies to expose the attacker. Existing defence solutions are
too heavy as an end-point solution and can be evaded by a dynamic attacker. In
contrast, our approach is lightweight and breaks the reactive arms race,
putting the attacker at a disadvantage.

Koopman operator theory provides a way to solve nonlinear systems by mapping
nonlinear dynamics to a linear space using eigenfunctions. Unfortunately,
finding such eigenfunctions is difficult. We introduce a method for
constructing eigenfunctions from a nonlinear ODE's invariant manifolds. This
method, when successful, allows us to find analytical solutions for constant
coefficient nonlinear systems. Previous data-driven methods have used Koopman
theory to construct local Koopman eigenfunction approximations valid in
different regions of phase space; our method finds analytic Koopman
eigenfunctions that are exact and globally valid. We demonstrate our Koopman
method of solving nonlinear systems on 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional ODEs.
The nonlinear examples considered have simple expressions for their invariant
manifolds which produce tractable analytical solutions. Thus our method allows
for the construction of analytical solutions for previously unsolved ordinary
differential equations. It also highlights the connection between invariant
manifolds and eigenfunctions in nonlinear ordinary differential equations and
presents avenues for extending this method to solve more nonlinear systems.

purely kinetic origin and perpendicular to the lattice. The former fields are
antiparallel at the two sites within a unit cell and rotate in accordance with
the momentum distribution of holes that follow the light field. When the light
field is weak, pseudospin dynamics are governed by the former fields; thus, the
average of the pseudospins almost vanishes. The latter fields are parallel at
the two sites within a unit cell and produce nonzero perpendicular components
of the pseudospins when the light field is strong. Numerically obtained
perpendicular components are consistent with the latter fields when the

The latter, in particular, is essential, since diversification increases the
odds of survival of an organism while reducing the risk of extinction of the
population. Primarily, diversification is a consequence of the randomness in
the replication process of a biological cell, which eventually manifests into a
motley set of macroscopic features of an individual. These heterogeneous
features of individuals constitutes for diversity in population. Cancer is a
prime example of such a complex system where the transformed cells exhibit
plethora of disparate features, which in turn makes modeling their dynamics
quite challenging. In this paper we consider cancer as a prototype of a complex
living system and provide two contrasting perspective for studying and modeling
it. Based on this we illicit a deeper role of diversification in the evolution
of cancer. Following this, we ask ourselves how can we model these diverse
dynamics in a multiscale setting. We address the shortcoming of the existing
multiscale modeling technique by providing an abstract but mathematically
rigorous framework for deducing stochastic evolution equations at the
macroscopic level starting from a microscopic description of the involved
dynamics. We achieve this by making use of the connection between stochastic
process and the semigroup operator generated by them. In particular, we look at
the semigroups generated by Levy processes and their connection with the
characteristic functions and Levy symbols. The latter turns out to represent
pseudo-differential operators using which we eventually provide a mechanism for
constructing stochastic evolution equations. Altogether, this provides the
framework for modeling diverse dynamics at the macroscale starting from the
microscale.

pattern, we determine the evolution of parameters (bio-mechanisms) that are

ansatzes in order to determine possible ways to impair or obstruct the process

combining the optimal model parameters responsible for generating different

parameters responsible for generating simple patterns. Going even further, we
ask ourselves if complex therapy approaches can be conceived by linearly
combining such that are able to reverse or disrupt simple pseudopalisade
patterns, which is then positively answered with the help of numerical

throughput satellite (HTS) communication systems are emerging as a key
technology for future communication generations. However, current frequency
bands are increasingly congested. Until the maturity of communication systems

frequency bands more efficiently. In this context, precoding emerges as one of
the prolific approaches to increasing spectral efficiency. This survey presents
an overview and a classification of the recent precoding techniques for HTS
communication systems from two main perspectives: 1) a problem formulation
perspective and 2) a system design perspective. From a problem formulation
point of view, precoding techniques are classified according to the precoding
objective, group, and level. From a system design standpoint, precoding is
categorized based on the system architecture, the precoding implementation, and
the type of the provided service. Further, practical system impairments are
discussed, and robust precoding techniques are presented. Finally, future
trends in precoding for satellites are addressed to spur further research.

data is relevant in many fields such as personalized medicine. However, in
practice, the treatment assignment is usually confounded by unobserved
variables and thus introduces bias. A remedy to remove the bias is the use of
instrumental variables (IVs). Such settings are widespread in medicine (e.g.,
trials where the treatment assignment is used as binary IV). In this paper, we
propose a novel, multiply robust machine learning framework, called MRIV, for
estimating CATEs using binary IVs and thus yield an unbiased CATE estimator.
Different from previous work for binary IVs, our framework estimates the CATE
directly via a pseudo outcome regression. (1)~We provide a theoretical analysis
where we show that our framework yields multiple robust convergence rates: our
CATE estimator achieves fast convergence even if several nuisance estimators
converge slowly. (2)~We further show that our framework asymptotically
outperforms state-of-the-art plug-in IV methods for CATE estimation, in the
sense that it achieves a faster rate of convergence if the CATE is smoother
than the individual outcome surfaces. (3)~We build upon our theoretical results
and propose a tailored deep neural network architecture called MRIV-Net for
CATE estimation using binary IVs. Across various computational experiments, we
demonstrate empirically that our MRIV-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance. To the best of our knowledge, our MRIV is the first multiply
robust machine learning framework tailored to estimating CATEs in the binary IV
setting.

superconducting quantum systems grow rapidly with the number of logical qubits
and their correction code distance. Decoding at room temperature is
bottle-necked by refrigerator I/O bandwidth while cryogenic on-chip decoding is
limited by area/power/thermal budget.
  To overcome these overheads, we are motivated by the observation that in the
common case, error signatures are fairly trivial with high redundancy/sparsity,
since the error correction codes are over-provisioned to correct for uncommon
worst-case complex scenarios (to ensure substantially low logical error rates).
If suitably exploited, these trivial signatures can be decoded and corrected
with insignificant overhead, thereby alleviating the bottlenecks described
above, while still handling the worst-case complex signatures by
state-of-the-art means.
  Our proposal, targeting Surface Codes, consists of:
  1) Clique: A lightweight decoder for decoding and correcting trivial
common-case errors, designed for the cryogenic domain. The decoder is
implemented for SFQ logic.
  2) A statistical confidence-based technique for off-chip decoding bandwidth
allocation, to efficiently handle rare complex decodes which are not covered by
the on-chip decoder.
  3) A method for stalling circuit execution, for the worst-case scenarios in
which the provisioned off-chip bandwidth is insufficient to complete all
requested off-chip decodes.
  In all, our proposal enables 70-99+% off-chip bandwidth elimination across a
range of logical and physical error rates, without significantly sacrificing
the accuracy of state-of-the-art off-chip decoding. By doing so, it achieves
10-10000x bandwidth reduction over prior off-chip bandwidth reduction
techniques. Furthermore, it achieves a 15-37x resource overhead reduction

origins of the double copy, and the question of why exact double copies are
possible in position space and when this form will break has remained largely
unanswered. In this paper, we provide an answer to this question, using a
recently developed twistorial formulation of the double copy. We show that for
certain vacuum type-D solutions, the momentum-space, twistor-space and
position-space double copies amount to the same thing, and are directly related
by integral transforms. Locality in position space is ultimately a consequence
of the very special form of momentum-space three-point amplitudes, and we thus
confirm suspicions that local position-space double copies are possible only
for highly algebraically-special spacetimes.

the traces using a novel embedding method that captures frequent action

StarCraft II (SC2), using traces from a handcrafted expert policy and a trained
reinforcement learning agent. We implemented a feature extractor for SC2
environments that extracts traces as sequences of high-level features
describing both the state of the environment and the agent's local behavior
from agent replays. We further designed a visualization tool depicting the
movement of units in the environment that helps understand how different task
conditions lead to distinct agent behavior patterns in each trace cluster.
Experimental results show that our framework is capable of separating agent
traces into distinct groups of behaviors for which our approach to strategy
inference produces consistent, meaningful, and easily understood strategy
descriptions.

to prevent the collapse of massive stars into black holes with mass in the

""{\em black hole mass gap}"". LIGO detection of black hole binary mergers
containing one or both black holes with masses in this {\em mass gap} thus
challenges the standard picture, possibly pointing to an unexpected merger

spatially resolved measurements with several um resolution perpendicular to the
laser propagation axis over a few mm along the beam propagation axis. The
rejection ring, as determined by the angular acceptance criteria of the filter,
is derived analytically, and the use of the ring for 1D laser line rejection is
explained. For the example cases presented, having a focused probe beam waist
with a diameter of ~150 um, the rejection ring can provide up to several mm
length along the beam propagation axis for a 1D measurement, which is also
tunable. Additionally, methods to further extend the measurable region are
proposed and demonstrated; using a collimation lens with a different focal
length or using multiple VBG filters. The latter case can minimize the
scattering signal loss, without the trade-off of the solid angle. Such use of
multiple VBGs is to extend the measurable region along the beam axis, which
differs from the commonly known application of multiple filters to improve the
suppression of elastic interferences. 1D rotational Raman and Thomson
scattering measurements are carried out on pulsed and DC discharges to verify
this method. The system features compactness, simple implementation, high
throughput, and flexibility to accommodate various experimental conditions.

outputs whether or not the presented group has property $P$. The articles by A.
A. Markov (Jr) give the analogous result for semigroups (a significantly easier

introduced as a model of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that has played a
foundational role in our understanding of these networks' stability and
invariance properties. Subsequently, there has been widespread interest in
extending the success of CNNs to data sets with non-Euclidean structure, such
as graphs and manifolds, leading to the emerging field of geometric deep
learning. In order to improve our understanding of the architectures used in
this new field, several papers have proposed generalizations of the scattering
transform for non-Euclidean data structures such as undirected graphs and
compact Riemannian manifolds without boundary.
  In this paper, we introduce a general, unified model for geometric scattering
on measure spaces. Our proposed framework includes previous work on geometric
scattering as special cases but also applies to more general settings such as
directed graphs, signed graphs, and manifolds with boundary. We propose a new
criterion that identifies to which groups a useful representation should be
invariant and show that this criterion is sufficient to guarantee that the
scattering transform has desirable stability and invariance properties.
Additionally, we consider finite measure spaces that are obtained from randomly
sampling an unknown manifold. We propose two methods for constructing a
data-driven graph on which the associated graph scattering transform
approximates the scattering transform on the underlying manifold. Moreover, we
use a diffusion-maps based approach to prove quantitative estimates on the rate
of convergence of one of these approximations as the number of sample points
tends to infinity. Lastly, we showcase the utility of our method on spherical
images, directed graphs, and on high-dimensional single-cell data.

propose a new paradigm called Restructurable Activation Networks (RANs) that
manipulate the amount of non-linearity in models to improve their
hardware-awareness and efficiency. First, we propose RAN-explicit (RAN-e) -- a
new hardware-aware search space and a semi-automatic search algorithm -- to
replace inefficient blocks with hardware-aware blocks. Next, we propose a
training-free model scaling method called RAN-implicit (RAN-i) where we
theoretically prove the link between network topology and its expressivity in
terms of number of non-linear units. We demonstrate that our networks achieve
state-of-the-art results on ImageNet at different scales and for several types
of hardware. For example, compared to EfficientNet-Lite-B0, RAN-e achieves a
similar accuracy while improving Frames-Per-Second (FPS) by 1.5x on Arm
micro-NPUs. On the other hand, RAN-i demonstrates up to 2x reduction in #MACs
over ConvNexts with a similar or better accuracy. We also show that RAN-i
achieves nearly 40% higher FPS than ConvNext on Arm-based datacenter CPUs.
Finally, RAN-i based object detection networks achieve a similar or higher mAP
and up to 33% higher FPS on datacenter CPUs compared to ConvNext based models.

we do not consider the outcome of users to be sensitive, rather only the
membership to certain groups. This is in contrast to previous work that has
considered locally private statistical tests, where outcomes and groups are
jointly privatized, as well as private A/B testing where the groups are
considered public (control and treatment groups) while the outcomes are
privatized. We cover several different settings of hypothesis tests after group
membership has been privatized amongst the samples, including binary and real
valued outcomes. We adopt the generalized $\chi^2$ testing framework used in
other works on hypothesis testing in different privacy models, which allows us
to cover $Z$-tests, $\chi^2$ tests for independence, t-tests, and ANOVA tests
with a single unified approach. When considering two groups, we derive
confidence intervals for the true difference in means and show traditional
approaches for computing confidence intervals miss the true difference when
privacy is introduced. For more than two groups, we consider several mechanisms
for privatizing the group membership, showing that we can improve statistical
power over the traditional tests that ignore the noise due to privacy. We also
consider the application to private A/B testing to determine whether there is a
significant change in the difference in means across sensitive groups between

not be constrained by existing biases in science, mechatronics, and

proposed to remap the victim DNN to a different architecture. Nonetheless, we
observe that, with only extracting an obfuscated DNN architecture, the
adversary can still retrain a substitute model with high performance (e.g.,
accuracy), rendering the obfuscation techniques ineffective. To mitigate this
under-explored vulnerability, we propose ObfuNAS, which converts the DNN
architecture obfuscation into a neural architecture search (NAS) problem. Using
a combination of function-preserving obfuscation strategies, ObfuNAS ensures
that the obfuscated DNN architecture can only achieve lower accuracy than the
victim. We validate the performance of ObfuNAS with open-source architecture
datasets like NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-301. The experimental results
demonstrate that ObfuNAS can successfully find the optimal mask for a victim

example, in systems that cannot simultaneously minimize all interaction energy
between the objects, a situation known as geometrical frustration. A typical
feature of these systems is the presence of accidental ground state degeneracy
that gives rise to a rich variety of unusual phenomena such as
order-by-disorder and spin glasses. In this article, we show that a dynamical
counterpart of these phenomena may arise from a fundamentally different,
non-equilibrium source of conflict: non-reciprocal interactions. We show that
non-reciprocal systems with anti-symmetric coupling generically generate
marginal orbits that can be regarded as a dynamical counterpart of accidental
degeneracy, due to the emerging Liouville-type theorem. These ""accidental
degeneracies"" of orbits are shown to often get ""lifted"" by stochastic noise or
weak random disorder to give rise to order-by-disorder phenomena with the
peculiarity that the emerging state usually has a time crystalline order. We
further report numerical evidence of a non-reciprocity induced spin-glass-like
state that exhibits aging and a power-law temporal relaxation associated with a
short-ranged spatial correlation. Our work provides an unexpected link between
the physics of complex magnetic materials and non-reciprocal matter.

the decoupled independence test (DIET), an algorithm that avoids both of these

Jupiter Family Comet (JFC) 250 years ago. In 350 years, following some 15
strong Jovian interactions, 282P will most likely migrate to become a JFC or,
less likely, a main-belt asteroid. These migrations highlight a dynamical
pathway connecting Centaurs and JFC with Quasi-Hildas and, potentially, active
asteroids. Synthesizing these results with our thermodynamical modeling and new

controls the conformation and dynamics of polar active polymer, i.e., head
activity commands the overall chain activity, resulting in re-entrant swelling
of active chains and non-monotonic variation of Flory exponent $\nu$. These
intriguing phenomena lie in the head-controlled railway motion of polar active
polymer, from which two oppose non-equilibrium effects emerge, i.e., dynamic
chain rigidity and the involution of chain conformation characterized by the
negative bond vector correlation. The competition between these two effects
determines the polymer configuration. Moreover, we identify several generic
dynamic features of polar active polymers, i.e., linear decay of the end-to-end
vector correlation function, polymer-size dependent crossover from ballistic to
diffusive dynamics, and a polymer-length independent diffusion coefficient that
is sensitive to head activity. A simple dynamic theory is proposed to

$b$-expansion and continued fraction expansion. This fact is a corollary of the
following result which deals with {\em pointwise joint ergodicity}:
  Let $T_b:[0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]$ be the times $b$ map defined by $T_b x = bx
\, \bmod \, 1 $ and let $T_G:[0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]$ be the Gauss map defined
by $T_G(x) = \{\frac{1}{x}\}$ for $x \ne 0$ and $T_G (0) =0.$ (Here $\{ \cdot
\}$ denotes the fractional part.) For any $f, g \in L^{\infty} (\lambda)$, \[
\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{N } \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} f(T_b^{n}x) \,
g(T_G^n x) = \int f \, d \lambda \cdot \int g \, d \mu_G \quad \text{for almost
every } x \in [0,1], \] where $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$ and
$\mu_G$ is the Gauss measure on $[0,1]$ given by $\mu_G (A) = \frac{1}{ \log 2}
\int_A \frac{1}{1+x} dx$ for any measurable set $A \subset [0,1]$.
  We show that the phenomenon of the pointwise joint ergodicity takes place for
a wide variety of number-theoretical maps of the interval and derive the
corresponding corollaries pertaining to joint normality.
  We also establish the equivalence of various forms of normality and joint
normality for representations of numbers, hereby providing a general framework
for classical normality results.

caused by unknown proprietary processing procedures, which means that their
visual quality is poorer than that of the originals. This paper presents a new
general video restoration framework for the restoration of user videos shared
on social media platforms. In contrast to most deep learning-based video
restoration methods that perform end-to-end mapping, where feature extraction
is mostly treated as a black box, in the sense that what role a feature plays
is often unknown, our new method, termed Video restOration through adapTive
dEgradation Sensing (VOTES), introduces the concept of a degradation feature
map (DFM) to explicitly guide the video restoration process. Specifically, for
each video frame, we first adaptively estimate its DFM to extract features
representing the difficulty of restoring its different regions. We then feed
the DFM to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to compute hierarchical
degradation features to modulate an end-to-end video restoration backbone
network, such that more attention is paid explicitly to potentially more
difficult to restore areas, which in turn leads to enhanced restoration
performance. We will explain the design rationale of the VOTES framework and
present extensive experimental results to show that the new VOTES method
outperforms various state-of-the-art techniques both quantitatively and
qualitatively. In addition, we contribute a large scale real-world database of

mainly consider capturing long-term temporal dependencies as skeleton sequences

current approaches are consisted of interleaving spatial-only modules and
temporal-only modules, where direct information flow among joints in adjacent

similar action pairs. To handle this limitation, we propose a general
framework, coined as STGAT, to model cross-spacetime information flow. It
equips the spatial-only modules with spatial-temporal modeling for regional

modeling, we propose three simple modules to reduce local spatial-temporal
feature redundancy and further release the potential of STGAT, which (1) narrow
the scope of self-attention mechanism, (2) dynamically weight joints along
temporal dimension, and (3) separate subtle motion from static features,
respectively. As a robust feature extractor, STGAT generalizes better upon
classifying similar actions than previous methods, witnessed by both

complex-valued signal from its Fourier intensity-only measurements, has
attracted considerable attention due to its widespread applications in digital
imaging. Recently, deep learning-based approaches were developed that achieved
some success in single-shot PR. These approaches require a single Fourier
intensity measurement without the need to impose any additional constraints on
the measured data. Nevertheless, vanilla deep neural networks (DNN) do not give
good performance due to the substantial disparity between the input and output
domains of the PR problems. Physics-informed approaches try to incorporate the
Fourier intensity measurements into an iterative approach to increase the
reconstruction accuracy. It, however, requires a lengthy computation process,
and the accuracy still cannot be guaranteed. Besides, many of these approaches
work on simulation data that ignore some common problems such as saturation and
quantization errors in practical optical PR systems. In this paper, a novel
physics-driven multi-scale DNN structure dubbed PPRNet is proposed. Similar to
other deep learning-based PR methods, PPRNet requires only a single Fourier
intensity measurement. It is physics-driven that the network is guided to
follow the Fourier intensity measurement at different scales to enhance the
reconstruction accuracy. PPRNet has a feedforward structure and can be
end-to-end trained. Thus, it is much faster and more accurate than the
traditional physics-driven PR approaches. Extensive simulations and experiments
on a practical optical platform were conducted. The results demonstrate the
superiority and practicality of the proposed PPRNet over the traditional
learning-based PR methods.

Leveraging existing annotated datasets with similar anatomical structures to
assist training has a potential for improving the model's performance. However,
it is further challenged by the cross-anatomy domain shift due to the different
appearance and even imaging modalities from the target structure. To solve this
problem, we propose Contrastive Semi-supervised learning for Cross Anatomy
Domain Adaptation (CS-CADA) that adapts a model to segment similar structures
in a target domain, which requires only limited annotations in the target
domain by leveraging a set of existing annotated images of similar structures
in a source domain. We use Domain-Specific Batch Normalization (DSBN) to
individually normalize feature maps for the two anatomical domains, and propose
a cross-domain contrastive learning strategy to encourage extracting domain
invariant features. They are integrated into a Self-Ensembling Mean-Teacher

solve the challenging cross-anatomy domain shift problem, achieving accurate

salient cross-modal alignments but may ignore some subtle and valuable pairs.
To relieve these issues, we introduce an Implicit Visual-Textual (IVT)
framework for text-based person retrieval. Different from previous models, IVT
utilizes a single network to learn representation for both modalities, which
contributes to the visual-textual interaction. To explore the fine-grained
alignment, we further propose two implicit semantic alignment paradigms:
multi-level alignment (MLA) and bidirectional mask modeling (BMM). The MLA
module explores finer matching at sentence, phrase, and word levels, while the
BMM module aims to mine \textbf{more} semantic alignments between visual and
textual modalities. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the
proposed IVT on public datasets, i.e., CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReID, and ICFG-PEDES.

a lightweight transformer network. We instantiate our novel designs of IntraRM

Besides, a collaborative pseudo re-labeling strategy is proposed to alleviate

is utilized to transfer images from the source domain to the target domain.
Moreover, person identity preserving and identity mapping losses are introduced
to improve the quality of generated images. Secondly, we propose a novel

is either under malicious attack (e.g., hacker attacks on power grids and
internet networks) or subject to extreme external conditions (e.g., weather
conditions impacting electricity grids or large market movements impacting
valuations of derivative contracts). For that purpose, we employ Physics
Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) -- universal approximators that can
incorporate prior information from any physical law described by a system of
PDEs. This prior knowledge acts in the training of the neural network as a
regularization that limits the space of admissible solutions and increases the
correctness of the function approximation. We show that when the true data
generating process exhibits changepoints in the PDE dynamics, this
regularization can lead to a complete miss-calibration and a failure of the
model. Therefore, we propose an extension of PINNs using a Total-Variation
penalty which accommodates (multiple) changepoints in the PDE dynamics. These
changepoints can occur at random locations over time, and they are estimated
together with the solutions. We propose an additional refinement algorithm that
combines changepoints detection with a reduced dynamic programming method that
is feasible for the computationally intensive PINNs methods, and we demonstrate
the benefits of the proposed model empirically using examples of different
equations with changes in the parameters. In case of no changepoints in the
data, the proposed model reduces to the original PINNs model. In the presence
of changepoints, it leads to improvements in parameter estimation, better model
fitting, and a lower training error compared to the original PINNs model.

perturbations in the initial condition decay with time $t$ as $t^{-d/2}$, which
can cause a large approximation error in the PINN solution. Localized large
gradients in the ADE solution make the (common in PINN) Latin hypercube
sampling of the equation's residual highly inefficient. Finally, the PINN
solution of parabolic equations is sensitive to the choice of weights in the
loss function. We propose a normalized form of ADE where the initial
perturbation of the solution does not decrease in amplitude and demonstrate
that this normalization significantly reduces the PINN approximation error. We
propose criteria for weights in the loss function that produce a more accurate
PINN solution than those obtained with the weights selected via other methods.
Finally, we proposed an adaptive sampling scheme that significantly reduces the
PINN solution error for the same number of the sampling (residual) points. We
demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed PINN model for forward, inverse, and
backward ADEs.

offer significant advantages in coverage and deployment flexibility, but suffer
from endurance limitations due to the limited onboard energy. This paper
proposes to improve the energy efficiency of UAV-enabled WPT systems with
multiple ground sensors by utilizing reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS).
Specifically, the total energy consumption of the UAV is minimized, while
meeting the energy requirement of each sensor. Firstly, we consider a
fly-hover-broadcast (FHB) protocol, in which the UAV radiates radio frequency
(RF) signals only at several hovering locations. The energy minimization
problem is formulated to jointly optimize the UAV's trajectory, hovering time
and the RIS's reflection coefficients. To solve this complex non-convex
problem, we propose an efficient algorithm. Specifically, the successive convex
approximation (SCA) framework is adopted to jointly optimize the UAV's
trajectory and hovering time, in which a minorization-maximization (MM)
algorithm that maximizes the minimum charged energy of all sensors is provided
to update the reflection coefficients. Then, we investigate the general
scenario in which the RF signals are radiated during the flight, aiming to
minimize the total energy consumption of the UAV by jointly optimizing the
UAV's trajectory, flight time and the RIS's reflection coefficients. By
applying the path discretization (PD) protocol, the optimization problem is
formulated with a finite number of variables. A high-quality solution for this
more challenging problem is obtained. Finally, our simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the benefits of RIS
in energy saving.

unambiguously detected in HI. Our study was significantly hampered by the high
spectral rms of HIPASS and thus in this paper we do not make any strong
conclusive claims but discuss the main trends and possible scenarios our

Either all the LSBGs in the groups, blue or red, have undergone environment
aided pre-processing and are HI deficient or the majority of them are distant
galaxies, beyond the HIPASS detection threshold. (B) The sample investigated is
most likely dominated by galaxies with HI masses typical of dwarf galaxies. Had
there been Milky Way (MW) size (R_e) galaxies in our sample, with proportionate
HI content, they would have been detected, even with the limitations imposed by
the HIPASS spectral quality. This leads us to infer that if some of the LSBGs
have MW size optical diameters, their HI content is possibly in the dwarf

resolve these questions.

structural properties of CeTiGe3 under pressure up to 9 GPa. The ferromagnetic
ordering in CeTiGe3 is suppressed with V doping in CeTi1-xVxGe3, and suggests a
possible ferromagnetic quantum critical point near x = 0.45. We perform a
detailed crystalline electric field (CEF) analysis, and the magnetic
susceptibility data in pure CeTiGe3 and CeVGe3 can be well explained by the CEF
model. The proposed CEF energy levels suggest that there is a gradual change of
the ground state from 5/2 state in CeTiGe3 to 1/2 state in CeVGe3, and a
suppression of CEF splitting energies near the quantum critical region. When
hydrostatic pressure is used instead of chemical substitution, the quantum
critical point is avoided by the appearance of magnetic phases above around 4.1
GPa. In the substitution study, the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions
are well separated, whereas they touch in the pressure study. We observe a
different trend in the temperature dependence of the resistivity maximum in
both studies, suggesting that the CEF splitting energy is suppressed by V
substitution but enhanced by pressure. We also observe different responses in
lattice constants between the two studies, highlighting the fact that
substitution effects cannot be reduced to chemical pressure effects only.
Nevertheless, when the magnetic phase diagrams of both hydrostatic pressure and
substitution are compared, we find a common critical lattice constant c = 5.78
A where the ferromagnetic ordering is suppressed in both studies.

this way, Tree-Transformer can learn the information of the node features as

functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) to aid the postoperative recovery.
Post-FESS patients have significantly altered anatomy leading to markedly
different flow dynamics from those found in pre-op or non-diseased airways,
resulting in unknown flow dynamics. Methods: This work investigated how the
liquid stream disperses through altered nasal cavities following surgery using
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A realistic squeeze profile was determined
from physical experiments with a 27-year-old male using a squeeze bottle with
load sensors. The administration technique involved a head tilt of 45-degrees
forward to represent a head position over a sink. After the irrigation event
that lasted 4.5 s, the simulation continued for an additional 1.5 s, with the
head orientation returning to an upright position. Results: The results
demonstrated that a large maxillary sinus ostium on the right side allows
saline penetration into this sinus. The increased volume of saline entering the
maxillary sinus limits the saline volume available to the rest of the sinonasal
cavity and reduces the surface coverage of the other paranasal sinuses. The
average wall shear stress was higher on the right side than on the other side
for two patients. The results also revealed that head position alters the
sinuses saline residual, especially the frontal sinuses. Conclusion: While
greater access to sinuses is achieved through FESS surgery, patients without a
nasal septum limits posterior sinus penetration due to the liquid crossing over
to the contralateral cavity and exiting the nasal cavity early.

  surprise-based framework",,,,,"cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  There is currently no established method for evaluating human response timing
across a range of naturalistic traffic conflict types. Traditional notions
derived from controlled experiments, such as perception-response time, fail to
account for the situation-dependency of human responses and offer no clear way
to define the stimulus in many common traffic conflict scenarios. As a result,
they are not well suited for application in naturalistic settings. Our main
contribution is the development of a novel framework for measuring and modeling
response times in naturalistic traffic conflicts applicable to automated
driving systems as well as other traffic safety domains. The framework suggests
that response timing must be understood relative to the subject's current
(prior) belief and is always embedded in, and dependent on, the dynamically
evolving situation. The response process is modeled as a belief update process
driven by perceived violations to this prior belief, that is, by surprising
stimuli. The framework resolves two key limitations with traditional notions of
response time when applied in naturalistic scenarios: (1) The strong
situation-dependence of response timing and (2) how to unambiguously define the
stimulus. Resolving these issues is a challenge that must be addressed by any
response timing model intended to be applied in naturalistic traffic conflicts.
We show how the framework can be implemented by means of a relatively simple
heuristic model fit to naturalistic human response data from real crashes and
near crashes from the SHRP2 dataset and discuss how it is, in principle,
generalizable to any traffic conflict scenario. We also discuss how the
response timing framework can be implemented computationally based on evidence
accumulation enhanced by machine learning-based generative models and the
information-theoretic concept of surprise.

capacity with imperfect channel estimation and ergodic Cramer-Rao bound (CRB)
of range sensing is investigated. Firstly, the closedform expressions of
ergodic capacity and ergodic range CRB are derived, which are associated with
the number of pilots. Secondly, two novel metrics named efficiency and utility
are firstly proposed to evaluate the joint performance of capacity and range
sensing error. Specifically, efficiency is used to evaluate the achievable
capacity per unit of the sensing error, and utility is designed to evaluate the
utilization degree of ISAC. Moreover, an algorithm of pilot length optimization
is designed to achieve the best efficiency. Finally, simulation results are
given to verify the accuracy of analytical results, and provide some insights
on designing the slot structure.

such a hypothesis can be arbitrarily far from the optimal one for the target
domain, induced by a gap termed ``adaptivity gap''. Without exploiting the
domain information from the unseen test samples, adaptivity gap estimation and
minimization are intractable, which hinders us to robustify a model to any
unknown distribution. In this paper, we first establish a generalization bound
that explicitly considers the adaptivity gap. Our bound motivates two
strategies to reduce the gap: the first one is ensembling multiple classifiers
to enrich the hypothesis space, then we propose effective gap estimation
methods for guiding the selection of a better hypothesis for the target. The
other method is minimizing the gap directly by adapting model parameters using
online target samples. We thus propose \textbf{Domain-specific Risk
Minimization (DRM)}. During training, DRM models the distributions of different
source domains separately; for inference, DRM performs online model steering
using the source hypothesis for each arriving target sample. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DRM for domain
generalization with the following advantages: 1) it significantly outperforms
competitive baselines on different distributional shift settings; 2) it
achieves either comparable or superior accuracies on all source domains

has become an important technology to utilize data from multiple parties with
privacy preservation. While MPL provides rigorous security guarantees for the
computation process, the models trained by MPL are still vulnerable to attacks
that solely depend on access to the models. Differential privacy could help to
defend against such attacks. However, the accuracy loss brought by differential
privacy and the huge communication overhead of secure multi-party computation
protocols make it highly challenging to balance the 3-way trade-off between
privacy, efficiency, and accuracy.
  In this paper, we are motivated to resolve the above issue by proposing a
solution, referred to as PEA (Private, Efficient, Accurate), which consists of
a secure DPSGD protocol and two optimization methods. First, we propose a
secure DPSGD protocol to enforce DPSGD in secret sharing-based MPL frameworks.
Second, to reduce the accuracy loss led by differential privacy noise and the
huge communication overhead of MPL, we propose two optimization methods for the
training process of MPL: (1) the data-independent feature extraction method,
which aims to simplify the trained model structure; (2) the local data-based
global model initialization method, which aims to speed up the convergence of
the model training. We implement PEA in two open-source MPL frameworks:
TF-Encrypted and Queqiao. The experimental results on various datasets
demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of PEA. E.g. when ${\epsilon}$ =
2, we can train a differentially private classification model with an accuracy
of 88% for CIFAR-10 within 7 minutes under the LAN setting. This result
significantly outperforms the one from CryptGPU, one SOTA MPL framework: it
costs more than 16 hours to train a non-private deep neural network model on
CIFAR-10 with the same accuracy.

$\partial$), a map that acts on the set of labelings of a poset. Extended
promotion is a generalization of Sch\""{u}tzenberger's promotion operator, a
well-studied map that permutes the set of linear extensions of a poset. It is
known that if $L$ is a labeling of an $n$-element poset $P$, then
$\partial^{n-1}(L)$ is a linear extension. This allows us to regard $\partial$
as a sorting operator on the set of all labelings of $P$, where we think of the
linear extensions of $P$ as the labelings which have been sorted. The labelings
requiring $n-1$ applications of $\partial$ to be sorted are called tangled; the
labelings requiring $n-2$ applications are called quasi-tangled. In addition to
computing the sizes of the fibers of promotion for rooted tree posets, we count
the quasi-tangled labelings of a relatively large class of posets called
inflated rooted trees with deflated leaves. Given an $n$-element poset with a
unique minimal element with the property that the minimal element has exactly
one parent, it follows from the aforementioned enumeration that this poset has
$2(n-1)!-(n-2)!$ quasi-tangled labelings. Using similar methods, we outline an
algorithmic approach to enumerating the labelings requiring $n-k-1$
applications to be sorted for any fixed $k\in\{1,\ldots,n-2\}$. We also make
partial progress towards proving a conjecture of Defant and Kravitz on the
maximum possible number of tangled labelings of an $n$-element poset.

is still unsatisfactory. To address this issue, this paper first introduces a
novel multi-directional dynamic programming strategy to adaptively determine
inliers (co-planar 3D points) by minimizing a (path) smoothness energy. The
depth gradients can then be refined iteratively using a novel recursive
polynomial interpolation algorithm, which helps yield more reasonable surface

refinement strategy is compatible with any depth-to-normal SNEs. Our proposed
SDA-SNE achieves much greater performance than all other SoTA approaches,
especially near/on spatial discontinuities. We further evaluate the performance
of SDA-SNE with respect to different iterations, and the results suggest that
it converges fast after only a few iterations. This ensures its high efficiency
in various robotics and computer vision applications requiring real-time

Addressing cake division under a typical requirement that each agent must

finding envy-free (fair) cake divisions. In particular, this work improves the
state-of-the-art additive approximation bound for this fundamental problem. Our
results hold for general cake division instances in which the agents'
valuations satisfy basic assumptions and are normalized (to have value $1$ for
the cake). Furthermore, the developed algorithms execute in polynomial time
under the standard Robertson-Webb query model.
  Prior work has shown that one can efficiently compute a cake division (with
connected pieces) in which the additive envy of any agent is at most $1/3$. An
efficient algorithm is also known for finding connected cake divisions that are
(almost) $1/2$-multiplicatively envy-free. Improving the additive approximation
guarantee and maintaining the multiplicative one, we develop a polynomial-time
algorithm that computes a connected cake division that is both

implementing those technical measures. We follow a research design that is 1)
exploratory in nature, 2) qualitative, and 3) interview-based, with 16 selected
privacy professionals in the technical and legal domains. Our results suggest
that there is no clear mutual understanding and commonly accepted approach to
handling technical measures. Both technical and legal roles are involved in the
implementation of such measures. While they still often operate in separate
spheres, a predominant opinion amongst the interviewees is to promote more
interdisciplinary collaboration. Our empirical findings confirm the need for
better interaction between legal and engineering teams when implementing
technical measures for data privacy. We posit that interdisciplinary
collaboration is paramount to a more complete understanding of technical
measures, which currently lacks a mutually accepted notion. Yet, as strongly
suggested by our results, there is still a lack of systematic approaches to
such interaction. Therefore, the results strengthen our confidence in the need
for further investigations into the technical-legal dynamic of data privacy
compliance.

severe medical events such as heart disease, lung disease, and sleep disorders.
Unfortunately, standard manual RR counting is prone to human error and cannot
be performed continuously. This study proposes a method for continuously
estimating RR, RRWaveNet. The method is a compact end-to-end deep learning
model which does not require feature engineering and can use low-cost raw
photoplethysmography (PPG) as input signal. RRWaveNet was tested
subject-independently and compared to baseline in four datasets (BIDMC,
CapnoBase, WESAD, and SensAI) and using three window sizes (16, 32, and 64
seconds). RRWaveNet outperformed current state-of-the-art methods with mean
absolute errors at optimal window size of 1.66 \pm 1.01, 1.59 \pm 1.08, 1.92
\pm 0.96 and 1.23 \pm 0.61 breaths per minute for each dataset. In remote
monitoring settings, such as in the WESAD and SensAI datasets, we apply
transfer learning to improve the performance using two other ICU datasets as
pretraining datasets, reducing the MAE by up to 21$\%$. This shows that this
model allows accurate and practical estimation of RR on affordable and wearable
devices. Our study also shows feasibility of remote RR monitoring in the
context of telemedicine and at home.

tiny noises, forcing neural networks to produce specific incorrect outputs.
With cross-model transferability, network models remain vulnerable even in

ensemble-based methods in generating transferable adversarial examples. To
further enhance transferability, model augmentation methods aim to produce more

various sites in iron is generally explained by the size of the solute and the
volume available for the solute atoms to occupy. Such an explanation based on
the size of solute atoms and available space at the occupation site assumes
that distortion alone dictates the stability of solute atoms. Using
first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we separately calculate the
distortion energy (DE) and electronic binding energy (EBE) of solute atoms in
iron. We show that electronic binding dictates the relative stability of O
rather than distortion. In contrast, the relative stability of B, C, and N is
dictated by the distortion it exerts on iron atoms. Contribution to the
relative stability of B atoms is dictated mostly by distortion. It suggests
that B could occupy a large volume region like grain boundaries. The same
agrees with experiments indicating B segregates at grain boundaries and planar
defects. Such conclusions could not have been drawn from the formation energy
calculation, which shows that B is stable at the substitution site.

heterojunction CuSbSe2 solar cells suffer from high recombination rate at the
interfaces and the presence of a Schottky barrier at the back contact, which
limit their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). In this study, we propose a
dual-heterojunction n-ZnSe/p-CuSbSe2/p+-CGS solar cell, having copper gallium
selenide (CGS) as the back surface field (BSF) layer. The BSF layer absorbs
longer wavelength photons through a tail-states-assisted (TSA) two-step
upconversion process, leading to enhanced conversion efficiency. Numerical
simulations were carried out using SCAPS-1D to investigate the performance of
the proposed solar cell with respect to absorber layer thickness, doping
concentrations and defect densities. The simulation results exhibit PCE as high
as 43.77% for the dual-heterojunction solar cell as compared to 27.74% for the
single heterojunction n-ZnSe/p-CuSbSe2 counterpart. The dual-heterojunction
structure has, therefore, the potential to approach the Shockley-Queisser (SQ)
detailed balance limit and can lead to extremely high PCEs in emerging thin
film solar cells.

safe state, the ACC approach can override the human operator's velocity control
commands. The safe state is defined as a state from which the vehicle can be
stopped safely, no matter which steering actions are applied by the operator.
This is achieved by first sampling various potential future trajectories. In a
second stage, assuming the trajectory with the highest risk, a safe and
comfortable velocity profile is optimized. This yields a safe velocity control
command for the vehicle. In simulations, the characteristics of the approach
are compared to a Model Predictive Control-based approach that is capable of
overriding both, the commanded steering angle as well as the velocity.
Furthermore, in teleoperation experiments with a 1:10-scale vehicle testbed, it
is demonstrated that the proposed ACC approach keeps the vehicle safe, even if
the control commands from the operator would have resulted in a collision.

torus and using them in the embedding check algorithm. It is a well-known fact
that any connected graph can be reduced to a one-vertex graph with loops and is
homotopy equivalent to such a graph. If a connected graph has intersection of
some edges, then some loops of one-vertex graph will also intersect. Therefore
the problem of embedding graphs into some surface is equivalent to the question
of embedding one-vertex graph in given surface. This paper considers a graph
with rotations or rotation system called hieroglyph. The equivalence of four
conditions is proved: (1) embedding hieroglyph into torus; (2) the absence of
forbidden subgraphs in a hieroglyph; (3) some condition for the graph of loops;
(4) the existence of a reduction of hieroglyph to one of the list of
hieroglyphs. We also prove the existence of an algorithm with complexity $O(n)$
that recognizes embedding hieroglyph into torus.

further collect rich features of users and items as well as users' behavior

study as they are being deployed in several applications due to their
ever-improving performance to solve challenging tasks. Despite overwhelming
promises, the deep learning systems are vulnerable to crafted adversarial
examples, which may be imperceptible to the human eye, but can lead the model
to misclassify. Protections against adversarial perturbations on ensemble-based
techniques have either been shown to be vulnerable to stronger adversaries or
shown to lack an end-to-end evaluation. In this paper, we attempt to develop a
new ensemble-based solution that constructs defender models with diverse
decision boundaries with respect to the original model. The ensemble of
classifiers constructed by (1) transformation of the input by a method called
Split-and-Shuffle, and (2) restricting the significant features by a method
called Contrast-Significant-Features are shown to result in diverse gradients
with respect to adversarial attacks, which reduces the chance of transferring
adversarial examples from the original to the defender model targeting the same
class. We present extensive experimentations using standard image
classification datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 against
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks to demonstrate the robustness of the
proposed ensemble-based defense. We also evaluate the robustness in the
presence of a stronger adversary targeting all the models within the ensemble
simultaneously. Results for the overall false positives and false negatives
have been furnished to estimate the overall performance of the proposed
methodology.

  Coloring","Accepted at SODA 2023",,,,"cs.DC cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Lov\'asz Local Lemma is a classic result in probability theory that is
often used to prove the existence of combinatorial objects via the
probabilistic method. In its simplest form, it states that if we have $n$ `bad
events', each of which occurs with probability at most $p$ and is independent
of all but $d$ other events, then under certain criteria on $p$ and $d$, all of
the bad events can be avoided with positive probability.
  While the original proof was existential, there has been much study on the
algorithmic Lov\'asz Local Lemma: that is, designing an algorithm which finds
an assignment of the underlying random variables such that all the bad events
are indeed avoided. Notably, the celebrated result of Moser and Tardos [JACM
'10] also implied an efficient distributed algorithm for the problem, running
in $O(\log^2 n)$ rounds. For instances with low $d$, this was improved to
$O(d^2+\log^{O(1)}\log n)$ by Fischer and Ghaffari [DISC '17], a result that
has proven highly important in distributed complexity theory (Chang and Pettie
[SICOMP '19]).
  We give an improved algorithm for the Lov\'asz Local Lemma, providing a
trade-off between the strength of the criterion relating $p$ and $d$, and the
distributed round complexity. In particular, in the same regime as Fischer and
Ghaffari's algorithm, we improve the round complexity to $O(\frac{d}{\log
d}+\log^{O(1)}\log n)$. At the other end of the trade-off, we obtain a
$\log^{O(1)}\log n$ round complexity for a substantially wider regime than
previously known.
  As our main application, we also give the first $\log^{O(1)}\log n$-round
distributed algorithm for the problem of $\Delta+o(\Delta)$-edge coloring a
graph of maximum degree $\Delta$. This is an almost exponential improvement
over previous results: no prior $\log^{o(1)} n$-round algorithm was known even
for $2\Delta-2$-edge coloring.

compared to conventional radars. Among these advantages, improved angular
diversity feature is being explored for future fully autonomous vehicles.
Improved angular diversity requires use of orthogonal waveforms at transmit as
well as receive sides. This orthogonality between waveforms is critical as the
cross-correlation between signals can inhibit the detection of weaker targets
due to sidelobes of stronger targets. This paper investigates the Reiterative
Minimum Mean Squared Error (RMMSE) mismatch filter design for range sidelobes
reduction for a Slow-Time Phase-Coded (ST-PC) Frequency Modulated Continuous
Wave (FMCW) MIMO radar. Initially, the performance degradation of RMMSE filter
is analyzed for improperly decoded received pulses. It is then shown
mathematically that proper decoding of received pulses requires phase
compensation related to any phase distortions caused due to doppler and spatial
locations of targets. To cater for these phase distortions, it is proposed to
re-adjust the traditional order of operations in radar signal processing to
doppler, angle and range. Additionally, it is also proposed to incorporate
sidelobes decoherence for further suppression of sidelobes. This is achieved by
modification of the structured covariance matrix of baseline single-input RMMSE
mismatch filter. The modified structured covariance matrix is proposed to
include the range estimates corresponding to each transmitter. These proposed
modifications provide additional sidelobes suppression while it also provides
additional fidelity for target peaks. The proposed approach is demonstrated
through simulations as well as field experiments. Superior performance in terms
of range sidelobes suppression is observed when compared with baseline RMMSE
and traditional Hanning windowed range response.

involving image tasks, but also encompasses many permutation-invariant
functions that finds emerging applications in science and engineering. We prove
sufficient conditions for universal approximation of these functions by a

techniques for route planning in road networks. It is a special incarnation of
distance labeling, and it is well-studied in both theory and practice. The core
concept of HL is to associate a label with each vertex, which consists of a
subset of all vertices and respective shortest path information, such that the
shortest path distance between any two vertices can be derived from considering
the intersection of their labels. HL provides excellent query times but
requires a time-consuming preprocessing phase. Therefore, in case of edge cost
changes, rerunning the whole preprocessing is not viable. Inspired by the
concept of Customizable Route Planning, we hence propose in this paper a
Customizable Hub Labeling variant for which the edge costs in the network do
not need to be known at construction time. These labels can then be used with
any edge costs after conducting a so called customization phase. We study the
theoretical properties of Customizable Hub Labelings, provide an
$\mathcal{O}(\log^2 n)$-approximation algorithm for the average label size, and
propose efficient customization algorithms.

outflows from a massive black hole. For the SNR scenario, a large relative RM
variation within a few years requires that the SNR is young with a thin and
local anisotropic shell, or the size of dense gas clouds in
interstellar/circumstellar medium around the SNR is extremely small. If the RM
variation is caused by the companion medium in a binary system, it is more
likely from the stellar winds of a massive/giant star companion. The RM
variation contributed by stellar flares from a low-mass star is disfavored,
because this scenario predicts an extremely large relative RM variation during
a short period of time. The scenarios invoking a pair plasma from a neutron

from a massive black hole could provide a large RM variation if the FRB source

mesh deformation under pose variation. Based on this observation, we propose to
embed the input query with its relationship to local surface regions spanned by
a set of geodesic nearest neighbors on mesh vertices. By including both
position and relative distance information, our embedding defines a
distance-preserved deformation mapping and generalizes well to unseen poses. To
reduce the dependency on additional inputs, we first initialize per-frame 3D
meshes using off-the-shelf tools and then propose a pipeline to jointly
optimize NeRF and refine the initial mesh. Extensive experiments show our
method can synthesize plausible human rendering results under unseen poses and
views.

holographic dark energy (SHDE) from the laws of horizon thermodynamics. Except
for entropies that follow an exponent stretched area law, unless we redefine
the horizon temperature, we found it challenging to construct a one-to-one
correspondence between the dark energies defined by the holographic principle
and the laws of thermodynamics. Secondly, in SHDE models, unless we invoke some
phenomenological interactions, it is impossible to explain the late-time cosmic
acceleration with the Hubble horizon as the IR cutoff. On the other hand, it is
possible to induce dark energy as an integration constant using the laws of
thermodynamics on the Hubble horizon. These motivated us to explore a feasible
way to invoke the holographic principle from the laws of horizon
thermodynamics. We show that the additional terms that appear in the modified
Friedmann equations on using entropies other than the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy in the first law of thermodynamics can behave like a dynamic
holographic dark energy (HDE). We study the features of such an HDE with
R\'enyi entropy as the choice without considering any non-standard
interactions. Interestingly, the resulting form of dark energy reduces to the
standard cosmological constant when R\'enyi entropy reduces to the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. By examining different parameters, we affirm the
validity of our approach to dark energy, which respects both holographic
principle and thermodynamics.

drastically deteriorate on tiny object detection tasks. In this paper, we point
out that either box prior in the anchor-based detector or point prior in the
anchor-free detector is sub-optimal for tiny objects. Our key observation is
that the current anchor-based or anchor-free label assignment paradigms will
incur many outlier tiny-sized ground truth samples, leading to detectors
imposing less focus on the tiny objects. To this end, we propose a Gaussian
Receptive Field based Label Assignment (RFLA) strategy for tiny object
detection. Specifically, RFLA first utilizes the prior information that the
feature receptive field follows Gaussian distribution. Then, instead of
assigning samples with IoU or center sampling strategy, a new Receptive Field
Distance (RFD) is proposed to directly measure the similarity between the
Gaussian receptive field and ground truth. Considering that the IoU-threshold
based and center sampling strategy are skewed to large objects, we further
design a Hierarchical Label Assignment (HLA) module based on RFD to achieve
balanced learning for tiny objects. Extensive experiments on four datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Especially, our approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors with 4.0 AP points on the AI-TOD

sometimes makes the DNN achieve superior performance. This paper provides a new
perspective to explain the success of knowledge distillation, i.e., quantifying
knowledge points encoded in intermediate layers of a DNN for classification,
based on the information theory. To this end, we consider the signal processing
in a DNN as the layer-wise information discarding. A knowledge point is
referred to as an input unit, whose information is much less discarded than
other input units. Thus, we propose three hypotheses for knowledge distillation
based on the quantification of knowledge points. 1. The DNN learning from
knowledge distillation encodes more knowledge points than the DNN learning from
scratch. 2. Knowledge distillation makes the DNN more likely to learn different
knowledge points simultaneously. In comparison, the DNN learning from scratch
tends to encode various knowledge points sequentially. 3. The DNN learning from
knowledge distillation is often optimized more stably than the DNN learning
from scratch. In order to verify the above hypotheses, we design three types of
metrics with annotations of foreground objects to analyze feature
representations of the DNN, \textit{i.e.} the quantity and the quality of
knowledge points, the learning speed of different knowledge points, and the
stability of optimization directions. In experiments, we diagnosed various DNNs
for different classification tasks, i.e., image classification, 3D point cloud
classification, binary sentiment classification, and question answering, which
verified above hypotheses.

time. To combat this rise, many machine learning (ML) algorithms for detecting
phishing emails have been developed. However, due to the limited email data
sets on which these algorithms train, they are not adept at recognising varied
attacks and, thus, suffer from concept drift; attackers can introduce small
changes in the statistical characteristics of their emails or websites to
successfully bypass detection. Over time, a gap develops between the reported
accuracy from literature and the algorithm's actual effectiveness in the real
world. This realises itself in frequent false positive and false negative
classifications.
  To this end, we propose a multidimensional risk assessment of emails to
reduce the feasibility of an attacker adapting their email and avoiding
detection. This horizontal approach to email phishing detection profiles an
incoming email on its main features. We develop a risk assessment framework
that includes three models which analyse an email's (1) threat level, (2)
cognitive manipulation, and (3) email type, which we combine to return the
final risk assessment score. The Profiler does not require large data sets to
train on to be effective and its analysis of varied email features reduces the
impact of concept drift. Our Profiler can be used in conjunction with ML
approaches, to reduce their misclassifications or as a labeller for large email
data sets in the training stage.
  We evaluate the efficacy of the Profiler against a machine learning ensemble
using state-of-the-art ML algorithms on a data set of 9000 legitimate and 900
phishing emails from a large Australian research organisation. Our results
indicate that the Profiler's mitigates the impact of concept drift, and
delivers 30% less false positive and 25% less false negative email
classifications over the ML ensemble's approach.

training labels is a major bottleneck for any supervised approach, preventing
getting insights about new physics. In this Letter, using quantum convolutional
neural networks, we overcome this limit by determining the phase diagram of a
model where analytical solutions are lacking, by training only on marginal
points of the phase diagram, where integrable models are represented. More
specifically, we consider the axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising (ANNNI)
Hamiltonian, which possesses a ferromagnetic, paramagnetic and antiphase,
showing that the whole phase diagram can be reproduced.

few-shot classification by proposing advanced language models, there is a
dearth of research in data annotation prioritisation that improves the
selection of the few shots to be labelled for optimal model performance. We
propose Active PETs, a novel weighted approach that utilises an ensemble of
Pattern Exploiting Training (PET) models based on various language models, to
actively select unlabelled data as candidates for annotation. Using Active PETs
for few-shot data selection shows consistent improvement over the baseline
methods, on two technical fact-checking datasets and using six different
pretrained language models. We show further improvement with Active PETs-o,
which further integrates an oversampling strategy. Our approach enables
effective selection of instances to be labelled where unlabelled data is
abundant but resources for labelling are limited, leading to consistently
improved few-shot claim verification performance. Our code is available.

  overlap with arXiv:1804.09541 by other authors",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, the attention-enhanced multi-layer encoder, such as Transformer,
has been extensively studied in Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC). To predict
the answer, it is common practice to employ a predictor to draw information
only from the final encoder layer which generates the coarse-grained
representations of the source sequences, i.e., passage and question. The
analysis shows that the representation of source sequence becomes more
coarse-grained from finegrained as the encoding layer increases. It is
generally believed that with the growing number of layers in deep neural
networks, the encoding process will gather relevant information for each
location increasingly, resulting in more coarse-grained representations, which
adds the likelihood of similarity to other locations (referring to
homogeneity). Such phenomenon will mislead the model to make wrong judgement
and degrade the performance. In this paper, we argue that it would be better if
the predictor could exploit representations of different granularity from the
encoder, providing different views of the source sequences, such that the
expressive power of the model could be fully utilized. To this end, we propose
a novel approach called Adaptive Bidirectional Attention-Capsule Network
(ABA-Net), which adaptively exploits the source representations of different
levels to the predictor. Furthermore, due to the better representations are at
the core for boosting MRC performance, the capsule network and self-attention
module are carefully designed as the building blocks of our encoders, which
provides the capability to explore the local and global representations,
respectively. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets, i.e., SQuAD
1.0, SQuAD 2.0 and COQA, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. In
particular, we set the new state-of-the-art performance on the SQuAD 1.0

most deployed MPs on IoT platforms are fragmented and are not implemented

is no systematic solution to perform automatic security checks on MP

  To bridge the gap, we present MPInspector, the first automatic and systematic
solution for vetting the security of MP implementations. MPInspector combines
model learning with formal analysis and operates in three stages: (a) using
parameter semantics extraction and interaction logic extraction to
automatically infer the state machine of an MP implementation, (b) generating
security properties based on meta properties and the state machine, and (c)
applying automatic property based formal verification to identify property
violations. We evaluate MPInspector on three popular MPs, including MQTT, CoAP
and AMQP, implemented on nine leading IoT platforms. It identifies 252 property
violations, leveraging which we further identify eleven types of attacks under
two realistic attack scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate that MPInspector is
lightweight (the average overhead of end-to-end analysis is ~4.5 hours) and
effective with a precision of 100% in identifying property violations.

interaction between the different components of these complex systems. These
components comprise the post-AGB primary, a main sequence secondary, a
circumbinary disk, as well as a fast bipolar outflow (jet) launched by the
companion. We obtained well-sampled time series of high resolution optical
spectra over the last decade and these spectra provide the basis of our study.
The jet is detected in absorption, at superior conjunction, when the line of
sight towards the primary goes through the bipolar cone. Our spectral time
series scan the jets during orbital motion. Our spatio-kinematic model is
constrained by these dynamical spectra. We complement this with a
radiative-transfer model in which the Balmer series are used to derive total
mass-loss rates in the jets. The jets are found to be wide and display an
angle-dependent density structure with a dense and slower outer region near the
jet cone and a fast inner part along the jet symmetry axes. The deprojected
outflow velocities confirm that the companions are main sequence companions.
The total mass-loss rates are large (10^{-8} and 10^{-5}\,solar mass per year),
from which we can infer that the mass-accretion rates onto the companion star
must be high as well. The circumbinary disk is likely the main source for the
accretion disk around the companion. All systems with full disks that start
near the sublimation radius show jets, whereas for systems with evolved
transition disks, this lowers to a detection rate of 50%. Objects without an
infrared excess do not show jets. We conclude that jet creation in post-AGB
binaries is a mainstream process. The interaction between the circumbinary
disks and the central binary provide the needed accretion flow, but the
presence of a circumbinary disk does not seem to be the only prerequisite to
launch a jet.

maximization, total power minimization for a target rate, minimum-weighted

illustration, we consider a multicell MIMO RIS-assisted broadcast channel (BC)

IQI generates improper noise, we consider improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) as
an interference-management technique that can additionally compensate for IQI.
We show that RS when combined with IGS can substantially improve the spectral

latent confounders, this paper studies the large-scale hypothesis testing
problem for the high-dimensional confounded linear models with both
non-asymptotic and asymptotic false discovery control. Such model covers a wide
range of practical settings where both the response and the predictors may be
confounded. In the presence of the high-dimensional predictors and the
unobservable confounders, the simultaneous inference with provable guarantees
becomes highly challenging, and the unknown strong dependency among the
confounded covariates makes the challenge even more pronounced. This paper
first introduces a decorrelating procedure that shrinks the confounding effect
and weakens the correlations among the predictors, then performs debiasing
under the decorrelated design based on some biased initial estimator.
Standardized test statistics are then constructed and the corresponding
asymptotic normality property is established. Furthermore, a simultaneous
inference procedure is proposed to identify significant associations, and both
the finite-sample and asymptotic false discovery bounds are provided. The
non-asymptotic result is general and model-free, and is of independent
interest. We also prove that, under minimal signal strength condition, all
associations can be successfully detected with probability tending to one.
Simulation studies are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed
approach and compare it with other competing methods. The proposed procedure is
further applied to detect the gene associations with the anti-cancer drug

ultraviolet (UV) photons from massive stars is expected to account for a large
fraction of the heating of neutral gas in galaxies. Evaluation of this
proposal, however, has been limited by our ability to directly compare
observational diagnostics to the results of a molecular model describing PAH
ionization. The objective of this article is to take advantage of the most
recent values of molecular parameters derived from laboratory experiments and
quantum chemical calculations on PAHs and provide a detailed comparison between
modeled values and observational diagnostics for the PAH charge state and the
heating efficiency for PAHs. Despite the use of a simple analytical model, we
obtain a good agreement between model results and observational diagnostics
over a wide range of radiation fields and physical conditions, in environments
such as star-forming regions, galaxies, and protoplanetary disks. In addition,
we found that the modeled photoelectric heating rates by PAHs are close to the
observed cooling rates given by the gas emission. These results show that PAH
ionization is the main source of neutral gas heating in these environments. The
results of our photoelectric heating model by PAHs can thus be used to assess
the contribution of UV radiative heating in galaxies (vs shocks, for instance).
We provide the empirical formulas fitted to the model results, and the full
python code itself, to calculate the heating rates and heating efficiencies for
PAHs.

the overall performance of FL in terms of communication time and accuracy under

  Domain Shifts",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, our goal is to adapt a pre-trained convolutional neural
network to domain shifts at test time. We do so continually with the incoming
stream of test batches, without labels. The existing literature mostly operates
on artificial shifts obtained via adversarial perturbations of a test image.
Motivated by this, we evaluate the state of the art on two realistic and
challenging sources of domain shifts, namely contextual and semantic shifts.
Contextual shifts correspond to the environment types, for example, a model
pre-trained on indoor context has to adapt to the outdoor context on CORe-50.
Semantic shifts correspond to the capture types, for example a model
pre-trained on natural images has to adapt to cliparts, sketches, and paintings
on DomainNet. We include in our analysis recent techniques such as
Prediction-Time Batch Normalization (BN), Test Entropy Minimization (TENT) and
Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CoTTA). Our findings are three-fold: i)
Test-time adaptation methods perform better and forget less on contextual
shifts compared to semantic shifts, ii) TENT outperforms other methods on
short-term adaptation, whereas CoTTA outpeforms other methods on long-term
adaptation, iii) BN is most reliable and robust. Our code is available at

takes a voxelized scan and its occupancy grid as input to reconstruct the full

Considering the spatial correlation between transmitters (TXs) and RISs, their

both discussed. For the RIS-aided transmission, the signal power distribution
with a direct link is approximated by a gamma random variable using a moment

is derived in closed form. Based on these expressions, we analyze the channel
hardening effect in the RIS-assisted transmission, the coverage probability,

Numerical results are provided to validate the analysis and illustrate the

of nanoscale steps formed by the termination of these planes. The rather
striking topography of this surface is well resolved with large tip biases of
the order of -8 V and set currents of magnitude less than 1 nA. Hysteresis in
the STS spectra is preferentially observed on the risers suggesting that they
contain a higher density of surface charge traps than the terraces where

Further, we investigate the dynamical stability of these solitons by adopting

(iii) allowing collision between the two spin-components by giving equal and

frequency of the soliton increases upon the increase in SO coupling, attaining
a maximum at the critical SO coupling where the phase transition from the

the fact that estimating these parameters require complex and nonlinear

Consequently, application of an efficient optimization algorithm to
successfully attain optimal controller parameters is critical. To accomplish
this task, the proposed EGBO algorithm is compared to the fundamental
Gradient-Based Optimizer (GBO), Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA), Sine

samples the farthest point and performs distance updating, is one of the most
popular sampling schemes. Unfortunately it suffers from low efficiency and can
become the bottleneck of point cloud applications. We propose adjustable FPS
(AFPS), parameterized by M, to aggressively reduce the complexity of FPS
without compromising on the sampling performance. Specifically, it divides the
original point cloud into M small point clouds and samples M points
simultaneously. It exploits the dimensional locality of an approximately sorted
point cloud data to minimize its performance degradation. AFPS method can
achieve 22 to 30x speedup over original FPS. Furthermore, we propose the
nearest-point-distance-updating (NPDU) method to limit the number of distance
updates to a constant number. The combined NPDU on AFPS method can achieve a
34-280x speedup on a point cloud with 2K-32K points with algorithmic
performance that is comparable to the original FPS. For instance, for the
ShapeNet part segmentation task, it achieves 0.8490 instance average mIoU (mean

more practical areas like cryptology or multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO)

considered. However, in communications, complex-valued processing is usually of
interest. Besides, by the use of dual-polarized transmission as well as by the
combination of two time slots or frequencies, four-dimensional
(quaternion-valued) approaches become more and more important. Hence, to
account for this fact, well-known lattice algorithms and related concepts are
generalized in this work. To this end, a brief review of complex arithmetic,
including the sets of Gaussian and Eisenstein integers, and an introduction to
quaternion-valued numbers, including the sets of Lipschitz and Hurwitz
integers, are given. On that basis, generalized variants of two important
algorithms are derived: first, of the polynomial-time LLL algorithm, resulting
in a reduced basis of a lattice by performing a special variant of the
Euclidean algorithm defined for matrices, and second, of an algorithm to
calculate the successive minima - the norms of the shortest independent vectors
of a lattice - and its related lattice points. Generalized bounds for the
quality of the particular results are established and the asymptotic
complexities of the algorithms are assessed. These findings are extensively
compared to conventional real-valued processing. It is shown that the
generalized approaches outperform their real-valued counterparts in complexity

mesophyll must develop from an initially confluent tissue into a tortuous
network of cells with a large proportion of intercellular airspace. How the
airspace in the spongy mesophyll develops while the cells remain mechanically
stable remains unknown. Here, we used computer simulations of deformable
particles to develop a purely mechanical model for the development of the
spongy mesophyll tissue. By stipulating that (1) cell perimeter grows only near
voids, (2) cells both form and break adhesive bonds, and (3) the tissue
pressure remains constant, the computational model was able to recapitulate the
developmental trajectory of the microstructure of the spongy mesophyll observed
in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. Robust generation of pore space in the spongy
mesophyll requires a balance of cell growth, adhesion, stiffness and tissue
pressure to ensure cell networks remain both porous yet mechanically robust.
The success of this mechanical model of tissue growth and porosity evolution
suggests that simple physical principles can coordinate and drive the

study the influence of the mode of turbulence driving on IMF. We find that

solenoidal driving (SOL). The characteristic (median) mass of the sink particle
(protostellar) distribution for COMP is shifted to lower masses by a factor of

match our simulation IMFs reasonably well in the high-mass and low-mass range,
but underestimate the number of very low-mass stars, which form towards the
later stages of our simulations and stop accreting due to dynamical
interactions. Our simulations show that for both COMP and SOL, the multiplicity
fraction is an increasing function of the primary mass, although the
multiplicity fraction in COMP is higher than that of SOL for any primary mass
range. We find that binary mass ratio distribution is independent of the

particles in SOL is a factor of 2 higher than that for COMP. Overall, we
conclude that the turbulence driving mode plays a significant role in shaping

Neural-Networks (RBFNNs) are used. In the same way, adaptive control is
utilized to estimate unknown parameters. By exploiting Lyapunov's direct
method, proper Lyapunov functional and Energy multiplier method are defined to
express well-known yet strong stability procedure, which compensates a complex
stability procedure proposed in the previous works. In the presence of the
designed controller, the presented stability procedure resulted in a uniform

a significant advantage in pinning down the binary spin dynamics, constraining
neutron star equation of state, probing FRB production mechanisms, and testing
beyond standard physics. As a proof of principle, we investigate several mock
observations of FRB pulses originating from pre-merger neutron star binaries,
and we find that using the information of FRB arriving times alone, the
intrinsic parameters of this system (including the stellar masses, spins, and
quadrupole moments) can be measured with high precision, and the angular
dependence of the FRB emission pattern can also be well reconstructed. The
measurement of stellar masses (with an error of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6}-10^{-5})$)

negative magnetoresistance with quadratic field dependence at low temperature,

However, these models often perform poorly on out-of-domain images. To mitigate
the shift in the input, image-to-image approaches can be used. Nevertheless,
standard image-to-image approaches that bridge the domain of deployment with
the synthetic training domain do not focus on the downstream task but only on
the visual inspection level. We therefore propose a ""task aware"" version of a
GAN in an image-to-image domain adaptation approach. With the help of a small
amount of labeled ground truth data, we guide the image-to-image translation to
a more suitable input image for a semantic segmentation network trained on
synthetic data (synthetic-domain expert). The main contributions of this work
are 1) a modular semi-supervised domain adaptation method for semantic
segmentation by training a downstream task aware CycleGAN while refraining from
adapting the synthetic semantic segmentation expert 2) the demonstration that
the method is applicable to complex domain adaptation tasks and 3) a less
biased domain gap analysis by using from scratch networks. We evaluate our
method on a classification task as well as on semantic segmentation. Our
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms CycleGAN - a standard

applications ranging from high-performance textiles to artificial tissues.
However, achieving structural control of the extracted nanofibers is
challenging as it is strongly dependent on the extraction methods and source

dynamics make them notoriously difficult to characterize in dispersions. In
this work, we study the diffusive motion of spherical gold nanoparticles in
semi-dilute networks of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) using X-ray Photon

subdiffusive with higher CNF concentration, where the dynamics can be
decomposed into several superdiffusive relaxation modes in reciprocal space.
Using simulations of confined Brownian dynamics in combination with simulated
XPCS-experiments, we observe that the dynamic modes can be connected to pore
sizes and inter-pore transport properties in the network. The demonstrated
analytical strategy by combining experiments using tracer particles with a

the driving mechanism to thermalisation is the formation of a shock that can be
predicted using a pair of generalised Burgers equations. We perform a
perturbative calculation at small energy per particle, proving that the energy
spectrum of the chain $E_k$ decays as a power law, $E_k\sim k^{-\zeta(t)}$, on
an extensive range of wavenumbers $k$. We predict that $\zeta(t)$ takes first
the value $8/3$ at the Burgers shock time, and then reaches a value close to
$2$ within two shock times. The value of the exponent $\zeta=2$ persists for
several shock times before the system eventually relaxes to equipartition.
During this wide time-window, an exponential cut-off in the spectrum is

critical for effective land and space planning and management. Due to complex
and mixed use, it is challenging for accurate land use mapping from widely-used
remote sensing images (RSI) directly, especially for high-density cities. To
address this issue, in this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine machine
learning-based approach for parcel-level urban land use mapping, integrating
multisource geospatial data, including RSI, points-of-interest (POI), and
area-of-interest (AOI) data. Specifically, we first divide the city into
built-up and non-built-up regions based on parcels generated from road
networks. Then, we adopt different classification strategies for parcels in
different regions, and finally combine the classified results into an
integrated land use map. The results show that the proposed approach can
significantly outperform baseline method that mixes built-up and non-built-up
regions, with accuracy increase of 25% and 30% for level-1 and level-2
classification, respectively. In addition, we examine the rarely explored AOI
data, which can further boost the level-1 and level-2 classification accuracy
by 13% and 14%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach and also indicate the usefulness of AOIs for land use mapping, which
are valuable for further studies.

ResNet as their new backbone network. Although their trackers work well in
regular scenarios, however, they simply flatten the 2D features into a sequence
to better match the Transformer. We believe these operations ignore the spatial
prior of the target object which may lead to sub-optimal results only. In
addition, many works demonstrate that self-attention is actually a low-pass
filter, which is independent of input features or key/queries. That is to say,
it may suppress the high-frequency component of the input features and preserve
or even amplify the low-frequency information. To handle these issues, in this
paper, we propose a unified Spatial-Frequency Transformer that models the
Gaussian spatial Prior and High-frequency emphasis Attention (GPHA)
simultaneously. To be specific, Gaussian spatial prior is generated using dual
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and injected into the similarity matrix produced
by multiplying Query and Key features in self-attention. The output will be fed
into a Softmax layer and then decomposed into two components, i.e., the direct
signal and high-frequency signal. The low- and high-pass branches are rescaled
and combined to achieve all-pass, therefore, the high-frequency features will
be protected well in stacked self-attention layers. We further integrate the
Spatial-Frequency Transformer into the Siamese tracking framework and propose a
novel tracking algorithm, termed SFTransT. The cross-scale fusion based
SwinTransformer is adopted as the backbone, and also a multi-head
cross-attention module is used to boost the interaction between search and
template features. The output will be fed into the tracking head for target
localization. Extensive experiments on both short-term and long-term tracking

Each cluster's description is used in turn to generate more inputs and assess
whether specific clusters induce more failures than expected. We use this
pipeline to demonstrate that we can effectively interrogate classifiers trained

preserved up to $p_{\rm lab}\simeq 50$ GeV/c, but changes significantly at
higher beam momenta due to the interference of valence quark configurations of

utilize it for information transmission in the uplink. Furthermore, to jointly
optimize the energy signal waveform and downlink beamforming, we assume that
the BS broadcasts a pulse-modulated signal employing multiple energy signal
vectors. We formulate an optimization problem for the joint design of the
downlink transmit energy signal vectors, their number, the durations of the
transmit pulses, and the time allocation policy for minimization of the average
transmit power at the BS. We show that for single-user WPCNs, a single energy

vector and drives the EH circuit at the user device into saturation, is
optimal. Next, for the general multi-user case, we show that the optimal signal
design requires a maximum number of energy signal vectors that exceeds the

of galaxies via the infall of baryonic matter (BM) and dark matter (DM) onto a
pre-existing over density. Unlike BM, DM particles can fly through a static
over density without being captured. We propose a simple model for DM capture:
if during the passage through it, the mass of the over density increases, then
slow DM particles are captured by it, further increasing its mass, while faster
particles slow down, transferring part of their energy to the galaxy. We
estimate the minimum initial velocity of a particle required for a passage
without capture through the center of the galaxy and derive a nonlinear
equation describing the rate of galaxy mass increase. An analysis carried out
using the ideas of catastrophes theory shows that if the increase in the mass
of baryonic matter exceeds a certain threshold value, this can lead to a very
intensive capture of dark matter. We speculate that this process may be
associated with the accretion of matter or with the merger of galaxies.
Additionally, for the studied process to take place, the density of
intergalactic DM must exceed some threshold value. Then the rate of increase in
the mass of DM can be much higher than the one of baryonic matter. The capture
sharply decreases after the DM density drops below the threshold value, e.g.,
due to the expansion of the Universe.

systems by representing users and items based on their historical interactions.
However, little attention was paid to GNN's vulnerability to exposure bias:
users are exposed to a limited number of items so that a system only learns a
biased view of user preference to result in suboptimal recommendation quality.
Although inverse propensity weighting is known to recognize and alleviate
exposure bias, it usually works on the final objective with the model outputs,
whereas GNN can also be biased during neighbor aggregation. In this paper, we
propose a simple but effective approach, neighbor aggregation via inverse
propensity (Navip) for GNNs. Specifically, given a user-item bipartite graph,
we first derive propensity score of each user-item interaction in the graph.
Then, inverse of the propensity score with Laplacian normalization is applied
to debias neighbor aggregation from exposure bias. We validate the
effectiveness of our approach through our extensive experiments on two public
and Amazon Alexa datasets where the performance enhances up to 14.2%.

walking problems among older people, and they often lead to diminished quality

and the evaluations may not always be objective. To facilitate early diagnosis,
recent deep learning-based methods have shown promising results for automated
analysis, which can discover patterns that have not been found in traditional
machine learning methods. We observe that existing work mostly applies deep
learning on individual joint features such as the time series of joint
positions. Due to the challenge of discovering inter-joint features such as the
distance between feet (i.e. the stride width) from generally smaller-scale
medical datasets, these methods usually perform sub-optimally. As a result, we
propose a solution that explicitly takes both individual joint features and
inter-joint features as input, relieving the system from the need of
discovering more complicated features from small data. Due to the distinctive
nature of the two types of features, we introduce a two-stream framework, with
one stream learning from the time series of joint position and the other from
the time series of relative joint displacement. We further develop a mid-layer
fusion module to combine the discovered patterns in these two streams for
diagnosis, which results in a complementary representation of the data for
better prediction performance. We validate our system with a benchmark dataset

the TM charging were carried out for the LISA Pathfinder (LPF) mission, that
was planned to test the LISA instrumentation. Measurements and simulations were
compared during the mission operations. The measured net TM charging agreed
with simulation estimates, while the charging noise was three to four times

still poses problems for observations and theoretical models. In recent
studies, the importance of the magnetic star-disk interaction for stellar spin
evolution has been elaborated. The accretion disk in these studies, however, is
only represented by a simplified model and important features are not
considered. We combined the implicit hydrodynamic TAPIR disk code with a
stellar spin evolution model. The influence of stellar magnetic fields on the
disk dynamics, the radial position of the inner disk radius, as well as the
influence of stellar rotation on the disk were calculated self-consistently.
Within a defined parameter space, we can reproduce the majority of fast and
slow rotating stars observed in young stellar clusters. Additionally, the back
reaction of different stellar spin evolutionary tracks on the disk can be
analyzed. Disks around fast rotating stars are located closer to the star.
Consequently, the disk midplane temperature in the innermost disk region
increases significantly compared to slow rotating stars. We can show the
effects of stellar rotation on episodic accretion outbursts. The higher
temperatures of disks around fast rotating stars result in more outbursts and a
longer outbursting period over the disk lifetime. The combination of a
long-term hydrodynamic disk and a stellar spin evolution model allows the
inclusion of previously unconsidered effects such as the back-reaction of
stellar rotation on the long-term disk evolution and the occurrence of
accretion outbursts. However, a wider parameter range has to be studied to
further investigate these effects. Additionally, a possible interaction between
our model and a more realistic stellar evolution code (e.g., the MESA code) can
improve our understanding of the stellar spin evolution and its effects on the
pre-main sequence star.

filtered tracking error (GFTE). While time delayed estimation framework
eliminates the need for accurate modelling of robot dynamics by estimating the
uncertain robot dynamics and interaction forces from immediate past data of
state and control effort, the second order switching control law in the outer
loop provides robustness against the time delayed estimation (TDE) error that
arises due to approximation of the manipulator dynamics. Thus, the proposed
control law tries to establish a desired impedance model between the robot end

and given its strong depletion during its stellar lifetime, the lithium element
is of great interest as its chemical evolution in the Milky Way is not well
understood at present. To help constrain stellar and galactic chemical
evolution models, numerous and precise lithium abundances are necessary for a
large range of evolutionary stages, metallicities, and Galactic volume. In the
age of stellar parametrization on industrial scales, spectroscopic surveys such
as APOGEE, GALAH, RAVE, and LAMOST have used data-driven methods to rapidly and
precisely infer stellar labels (atmospheric parameters and abundances). To
prepare the ground for future spectroscopic surveys such as 4MOST and WEAVE, we
aim to apply machine learning techniques to lithium measurements and analyses.
We trained a convolution neural network (CNN), coupling Gaia-ESO Survey iDR6
stellar labels (Teff, log(g), [Fe/H], and A(Li)) and GIRAFFE HR15N spectra, to
infer the atm parameters and lithium abundances for ~40,000 stars. We show that
the CNN properly learns the physics of the stellar labels, from relevant
spectral features through a broad range of evolutionary stages and stellar
parameters. The Li feature at 6707.8 A is successfully singled out by our CNN,
among the thousands of lines. Rare objects such as Li-rich giants are found in
our sample. This level of performance is achieved thanks to a meticulously
built, high-quality, and homogeneous training sample. The CNN approach is very
well adapted for the next generations of spectroscopic surveys aimed at
studying (among other elements) lithium, such as the 4MIDABLE-LR/HR (4MOST
Milky Way disk and bulge low- and high-resolution) surveys. In this context,
the caveats of ML applications should be appropriately investigated, along with
the realistic label uncertainties and upper limits for abundances.

major contributor to the execution time and energy consumption of modern

amount of data being generated across multiple application domains. These
trends suggest a need for a paradigm shift towards a data-centric approach
where computation is performed close to where the data resides. Further, a
data-centric approach can enable a data-driven view where we take advantage of
vast amounts of available data to improve architectural decisions.
  As a step towards modern architectures, this dissertation contributes to
various aspects of the data-centric approach and proposes several data-driven
mechanisms.
  First, we design NERO, a data-centric accelerator for a real-world weather
prediction application. Second, we explore the applicability of different
number formats, including fixed-point, floating-point, and posit, for different
stencil kernels. Third, we propose NAPEL, an ML-based application performance
and energy prediction framework for data-centric architectures. Fourth, we
present LEAPER, the first use of few-shot learning to transfer FPGA-based
computing models across different hardware platforms and applications. Fifth,
we propose Sibyl, the first reinforcement learning-based mechanism for data
placement in hybrid storage systems.
  Overall, this thesis provides two key conclusions: (1) hardware acceleration
on an FPGA+HBM fabric is a promising solution to overcome the data movement
bottleneck of our current computing systems; (2) data should drive system and
design decisions by leveraging inherent data characteristics to make our
computing systems more efficient.

which the neural light field is implicitly associated with light clues of
specular reflectance and cast shadow. The unsupervised, joint optimization of
neural intrinsics fields can be free from training data bias as well as

structure and atomic forces are solved by a real-space dynamical mean-field
theory (DMFT). Contrary to most quantum MD methods that are based on effective
single-particle wave functions, the DMFT approach is able to describe
correlation-induced Mott metal-insulator transitions and the associated
incoherent electronic excitations in an atomic liquid. We apply the DMFT-MD
method to study Mott transitions in an atomic liquid model which can be viewed
as the liquid-state generalization of the Hubbard model. The half-filled
Hubbard liquids also provide a minimum model for alkali fluid metals. Our
simulations uncover two distinct types of Mott transition depending on the
atomic bonding and short-range structures in the electronically delocalized
phase. In the first scenario where atoms tend to form dimers, increasing the
Hubbard repulsion gives rise to a transition from a molecular insulator to an
atomic insulator with a small window of enhanced metallicity in the vicinity of
the localization transition. On the other hand, for Hubbard liquids with atoms
forming large conducting clusters, the localization of electrons leads to the
fragmentation of clusters and is intimately related to the liquid-gas
transition of atoms. Implications of our results for metal-insulator
transitions in fluid alkali metals are discussed.

resampling invariance properties of Gibbs measures on infinite ensembles of
random continuous curves into which the KPZ equation (under narrow-wedge
initial data) can be embedded. We obtain sharp one-point upper tail estimates,
uniformly in the time parameter, showing that the probability of the value at
zero being larger than $\theta$ is $\exp(-\frac{4}{3}\theta^{3/2}(1+o(1)))$,
for a general class of initial data including the narrow-wedge. Our arguments
also yield the first known density estimates for the narrow-wedge case, which
are optimal. A key intermediate step is developing a precise understanding of
the profile when conditioned on the value at zero equaling $\theta$. Our method
further allows one to obtain multi-point asymptotics which were out of reach of
previous approaches. As an example, we prove sharp explicit two-point upper
tail estimates. All of our arguments also apply to the zero-temperature case of
the Airy$_2$ process; even here, while some of the one-point estimates were
already available due to its connections to random matrix theory, the two-point
asymptotics are new. Finally, to showcase the reach of the method, we obtain
the same results in a purely non-integrable setting under only assumptions of
stationarity and extremality in the class of Gibbs measures, thus providing
evidence in favour of a conjecture suggested by Sheffield and formulated by
Corwin-Hammond on a characterization of such line ensembles. Our method bears

extremely high conductivity and an extraordinarily large mean free path, the
second harmonic generation is unscreened by conduction electrons, we observed
rather strong SHG response compared to non-topological polar metals and
archetypal ferroelectric insulators. Additionally, our time-resolved SHG

$\beta$-WP$_2$ tends to form inversion symmetric metastable state after
photo-excitation. Intense femtosecond laser pulse could optically drive

parameters. Therefore, $ D $-optimal designs are only locally optimal in the
parameter space. This dependence renders the optimization problem very
difficult, as standard theory encodes $ D $-optimality in systems of highly
nonlinear equations and inequalities. In this work, we connect design theory
for discrete choice experiments with Laplacian matrices of connected graphs. We
rewrite the $ D $-optimality criterion in terms of Laplacians via Kirchhoff's
matrix tree theorem, and show that its dual has a simple description via the
Cayley--Menger determinant of the Farris transform of the Laplacian matrix.
This results in a drastic reduction of complexity and allows us to implement a
gradient descent algorithm to find locally $ D $-optimal designs. For the
subclass of Bradley--Terry paired comparison models, we find a direct link to
maximum likelihood estimation for Laplacian-constrained Gaussian graphical
models. This implies that every locally $ D $-optimal design is a rational
function in the parameter when the design is supported on a chordal graph.
Finally, we study the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its
application on real and simulated data.

combinations of field maps from IllustrisTNG in the CAMELS project. The fields
considered are neutral hydrogen (HI), gas density (Mgas), magnetic fields (B)
and gas metallicity (Z). We estimate the predictive uncertainty on the
predictions of our model by using Monte Carlo dropout, a Bayesian
approximation. Results show that overall, the performance of the model improves
on all parameters as the number of channels of its input is increased. As
compared to previous works, our model is able to predict the astrophysical
parameters with up to $5\%$ higher in accuracy. In the best setup which
includes all fields (four channel input, Mgas-HI-B-Z) the model achieves $R^{2}
> 0.96$ on all parameters. Similarly, we find that the total uncertainty, which
is dominated by the aleatoric uncertainty, decreases as more fields are used to
train the model in general. The uncertainties obtained by dropout variational
inference are overestimated on all parameters in our case, in that the
predictive uncertainty is much larger than the actual squared error. After
calibration, which consists of a simple $\sigma$ scaling method, the average
deviation of the total uncertainty from the actual error goes down to $25\%$ at

shadow-based attacks, causes misidentifications by applying a natural-looking

is a sensation of work of a brain that converts external and internal signals
into visual output. However, as we well know, human consciousness includes
meaning (interpretation), and therefore functionally possesses an additional
level of complexity. It consists of concepts which are its minimal components
(elementary constituents). A concept is an abstract (i.e. non-existent in
nature) common property of different observables, as perceived by humans. It is
an irreducible entity since it cannot be divided into any other functional
components. At the biological and physical level each concept is a unique
sensation encoded in a nervous system as a sensory and visual image. Concepts
evolve throughout one's lifetime. We continuously create and acquire new
concepts, develop and expand the existing ones, and eliminate and abandon some
others. 'I' ('self') is one of the concepts. To acquire a concept one has to
learn (to teach one's nervous system) feeling or sensing it, and to connect it
to existing concepts, if any. We make a conjecture that both the creation and
the acquisition of a concept is a phase transition. The ability to generate and
acquire concepts is unique to humans and is the only principal difference
between human and animal. We offer scenarios for how this ability could have
been acquired by our predecessors, thus making them humans. It is suggested
that the animal's brain, being a processor of visual signals that converts them
into internal images, has developed this ability as a result of ""guessing"" or
imagining details that are missing in the actual visible picture.

avoid adoption failure, the alternative blockchains have to either (1) directly
subsidize the new entrant firms or (2) offer better features, which in practice
can take form in lower transaction costs, faster finality, or larger network

ringing, i.e., a train of subpulses following the main pulse. Owing to the

person images conditioned on texts only. State-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models are mainly designed for center-object generation, e.g.,
flowers and birds. Unlike center-placed objects with similar shapes and
orientation, person image generation is a more challenging task, for which we
observe the followings: 1) the generated images for the same person exhibit
visual details with identity-consistency, e.g., identity-related
textures/clothes/shoes across the images, and 2) those images should be
discriminant for being robust against the inter-person variations caused by
visual ambiguities. To address the above challenges, we develop an effective
generative model to produce person images with two novel mechanisms. In
particular, our first mechanism (called T-Person-GAN-ID) is to integrate the
one-stream generator with an identity-preserving network such that the
representations of generated data are regularized in their feature space to
ensure the identity-consistency. The second mechanism (called
T-Person-GAN-ID-MM) is based on the manifold mix-up to produce mixed images via
the linear interpolation across generated images from different manifold
identities, and we further enforce such interpolated images to be linearly
classified in the feature space. This amounts to learning a linear
classification boundary that can perfectly separate images from two identities.
Our proposed method is empirically validated to achieve a remarkable
improvement in text-to-person image generation. Our architecture is orthogonal
to StackGAN++ , and focuses on person image generation, with all of them
together to enrich the spectrum of GANs for the image generation task. Codes

EIS offers a possible solution to realizing future Intelligent Transportation

susceptible to numerous malicious attacks. Hence, to solve the issues mentioned
earlier, this paper presents the notion of secure edge intelligence, merging
the benefits of Federated Learning (FL), blockchain, and Local Differential

strengthen the confidentiality of data sharing transactions, especially in

number of key parameters that settle the rephasing problems is reduced by
developing a set of linearized equations of motion based on the Sundman
transformation and by formulating two reduced shooting functions using the
minimum principle and symmetry properties. Only one key parameter is identified
for the time-optimal problem, while two key parameters are obtained for the
propellant-optimal one. Numerical investigation of the relationships between
these parameters and shooting variables reveals that they can be depicted by
some curve (or contour) maps and approximated by piecewise functions (or linear

problem that seeks to estimate optical parameters from boundary measurements.
In the Bayesian framework, the ill-posedness is diminished by incorporating
{\em a priori} information of the optical parameters via the prior
distribution. In case the target is sparse or sharp-edged, the common choice as
the prior model are non-differentiable total variation and $\ell^1$ priors.
Alternatively, one can hierarchically extend the variances of a Gaussian prior
to obtain differentiable sparsity promoting priors. By doing this, the
variances are treated as unknowns allowing the estimation to locate the
discontinuities. In this work, we formulate hierarchical prior models for the
nonlinear DOT inverse problem using exponential, standard gamma and
inverse-gamma hyperpriors. Depending on the hyperprior and the hyperparameters,
the hierarchical models promote different levels of sparsity and smoothness. To
compute the MAP estimates, the previously proposed alternating algorithm is
adapted to work with the nonlinear model. We then propose an approach based on
the cumulative distribution function of the hyperpriors to select the
hyperparameters. We evaluate the performance of the hyperpriors with numerical
simulations and show that the hierarchical models can improve the localization,
contrast and edge sharpness of the reconstructions.
