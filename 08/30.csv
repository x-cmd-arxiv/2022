conditional on patient characteristics can critically inform medical decisions.
Quantifying the performance of treatment benefit prediction algorithms is an
active area of research. A recently proposed metric, the concordance statistic
for benefit (cfb), evaluates the discriminative ability of a treatment benefit
predictor by directly extending the concept of the concordance statistic from a
risk model with a binary outcome to a model for treatment benefit. In this
work, we scrutinize $cfb$ on multiple fronts. Through numerical examples and
theoretical developments, we show that cfb is not a proper scoring rule. We
also show that it is sensitive to the unestimable correlation between
counterfactual outcomes and to the definition of matched pairs. We argue that
measures of statistical dispersion applied to predicted benefits do not suffer
from these issues and can be an alternative metric for the discriminatory
performance of treatment benefit predictors.

Starting with a case study of estimating the mean potential outcome (hence
average treatment effect), we instantiate the exact relationship between
finite-differences and the analytical Gateaux derivative. We then derive
requirements on the rates of numerical approximation in perturbation and
smoothing that preserve the statistical benefits of one-step adjustments, such
as rate-double-robustness. We then study more complicated functionals such as
dynamic treatment regimes and the linear-programming formulation for policy
optimization in infinite-horizon Markov decision processes. The newfound
ability to approximate bias adjustments in the presence of arbitrary
constraints illustrates the usefulness of constructive approaches for Gateaux
derivatives. We also find that the statistical structure of the functional
(rate-double robustness) can permit less conservative rates of
finite-difference approximation. This property, however, can be specific to

well-studied resource allocation problems such as load balancing and virtual

has multiple possible configurations, each of which increases the load of each

request to minimize the makespan: the load of the most-loaded resource. In our
work, we focus on a stochastic setting, where we only know the distribution for
how each configuration increases the resource loads, learning the realized
value only after a configuration is chosen.
  We develop both offline and online algorithms for configuration balancing
with stochastic requests. When the requests are known offline, we give a
non-adaptive policy for configuration balancing with stochastic requests that
$O(\frac{\log m}{\log \log m})$-approximates the optimal adaptive policy. In
particular, this closes the adaptivity gap for this problem as there is an
asymptotically matching lower bound even for the very special case of load
balancing on identical machines. When requests arrive online in a list, we give
a non-adaptive policy that is $O(\log m)$ competitive. Again, this result is
asymptotically tight due to information-theoretic lower bounds for very special
cases (e.g., for load balancing on unrelated machines). Finally, we show how to
leverage adaptivity in the special case of load balancing on related machines
to obtain a constant-factor approximation offline and an $O(\log \log

  Our algorithm follows the primal-dual framework and uses online mirror

setup of OMD, and therefore the classic low-regret guarantee of OMD, which is
for the adversarial setting in online learning, no longer holds. Nonetheless,
in our case and more generally where low-regret dynamics are applied in
algorithm design, the gradients encountered by OMD can be far from adversarial
but influenced by our algorithmic choices. We exploit this key insight to show
our OMD setup achieves low regret in the realm of our algorithm.

significant progress in improving the visual quality and lip-sync quality of
the synthesized videos, they pay less attention to lip motion jitters which
greatly undermine the realness of talking face videos. What causes motion
jitters, and how to mitigate the problem? In this paper, we conduct systematic
analyses on the motion jittering problem based on a state-of-the-art pipeline
that uses 3D face representations to bridge the input audio and output video,
and improve the motion stability with a series of effective designs. We find
that several issues can lead to jitters in synthesized talking face video: 1)
jitters from the input 3D face representations; 2) training-inference mismatch;
3) lack of dependency modeling among video frames. Accordingly, we propose
three effective solutions to address this issue: 1) we propose a gaussian-based
adaptive smoothing module to smooth the 3D face representations to eliminate
jitters in the input; 2) we add augmented erosions on the input data of the
neural renderer in training to simulate the distortion in inference to reduce
mismatch; 3) we develop an audio-fused transformer generator to model
dependency among video frames. Besides, considering there is no off-the-shelf
metric for measuring motion jitters in talking face video, we devise an
objective metric (Motion Stability Index, MSI), to quantitatively measure the
motion jitters by calculating the reciprocal of variance acceleration.
Extensive experimental results show the superiority of our method on
motion-stable face video generation, with better quality than previous systems.

the promise of leveraging unlabeled data to improve an object detector.
However, thus far these methods have assumed that the unlabeled data does not
contain out-of-distribution (OOD) classes, which is unrealistic with
larger-scale unlabeled datasets. In this paper, we consider a more practical
yet challenging problem, Open-Set Semi-Supervised Object Detection (OSSOD). We
first find the existing SSOD method obtains a lower performance gain in
open-set conditions, and this is caused by the semantic expansion, where the
distracting OOD objects are mispredicted as in-distribution pseudo-labels for
the semi-supervised training. To address this problem, we consider online and
offline OOD detection modules, which are integrated with SSOD methods. With the
extensive studies, we found that leveraging an offline OOD detector based on a
self-supervised vision transformer performs favorably against online OOD
detectors due to its robustness to the interference of pseudo-labeling. In the
experiment, our proposed framework effectively addresses the semantic expansion
issue and shows consistent improvements on many OSSOD benchmarks, including
large-scale COCO-OpenImages. We also verify the effectiveness of our framework
under different OSSOD conditions, including varying numbers of in-distribution
classes, different degrees of supervision, and different combinations of

magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) model of a solar plage region is created. Synthetic
H$\alpha$ spectra are generated and the spectral signatures of these features
are identified. The magnetic field lines associated with these events are
traced and the underlying dynamic is studied. The model reproduces well many
properties of RBEs and RREs, such as spatial distribution, lateral movement,
length and lifetimes. Synthetic H$\alpha$ line profiles, similarly to observed

caused by the vertical component of velocity with magnitudes larger than
$30-40$ km/s that appear mostly in the height range of $2-4$ Mm. By tracing
magnetic field lines, we show that the vertical velocity that causes the
appearance of RBE/RREs to appear is always associated with the component of
velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field line. The study confirms the

quantized features, followed by a coarse-to-fine gating for producing image

input conditions like text, scene graph, or image layout can be further
exploited. Thus, Frido can be also applied for conditional or cross-modality
image synthesis. We conduct extensive experiments over various unconditioned

layout-to-image, scene-graph-to-image, to label-to-image. More specifically, we

higher dimensions, and can be interpreted in higher-categorical terms by a

describes a well-behaved class of embedded manifolds that can likewise be
interpreted categorically. In this paper we formally introduce the notions of
manifold diagrams and of tame tangles, and show that they admit a combinatorial
classification, by using results from the toolbox of framed combinatorial
topology. We then study the stability of tame tangles under perturbation; the
local forms of perturbation stable tame tangles provide combinatorial models of
differential singularities. As an illustration we describe various such
combinatorial singularities in low dimensions. We conclude by observing that
all smooth 4-manifolds can be presented as tame tangles, and conjecture that
the same is true for smooth manifolds of any dimension.

nonlinear dynamics of a confined nanopore system at the liquid-air interface.
The finite-range interactions between the interacting species are quantified

the finite element method and analysed mathematically with the Landau

We explain the formation of oscillating condensate within the system in the
liquid phase. The high velocity near the specific boundaries of the system, the
sudden disappearance of oscillations, and its dependence on evaporation are
explored. This transition of classical mechanics with the outlook of quantum
mechanics leaves several open questions for further investigation in the field

high-power laser, and the buildup of a vapor cloud precludes the subsequent

that extend the electroweak group into a simple group that includes the color
symmetry. The minimal option is a gauge-Higgs grand unification based on the
SU(6) gauge group, mirroring SU(5) grand unification in 4D while providing a
solution to the hierarchy problem. We explore different minimal and realistic
novel incarnations of SU(6) gauge-Higgs grand unification. We submit the setup
to the various flavor hierarchies observed in nature and, utilizing the power
of the fifth dimension, identify an embedding that provides a compelling model
of quarks and leptons that naturally explains the mass hierarchies and the
CKM/PMNS structure. We perform a detailed study of quark - and lepton - flavor
constraints (which are intimately related due to the GUT nature) together with
an analysis of the Higgs potential which arises at the loop level. Electroweak
precision constraints on the model are discussed and the rich scalar sector is
analyzed. Future flavor constraints from upcoming experiments will provide a
stringent test for this class of models, while a scalar singlet and leptoquark
provide unique targets for current and future collider experiments to probe
this solution to various open questions in nature.

recent Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) spectroscopic data to securely

We measure the stellar velocity dispersions of 13 cluster galaxies, enabling an

best modelled with a single large-scale mass component, a galaxy-scale

The best-fit strong lensing model yields a root mean square separation between
the model-predicted and observed positions of the multiple images of 0"".29.
When analysing the impact of systematic uncertainties, stemming from modelling
assumptions and used observables, we find that the projected total mass
profile, relative weight of the sub-halo mass component, and critical lines are
consistent, within the statistical uncertainties. The predicted magnification
and time delay values are, instead, more sensitive to the local details of the

depleted in gas-phase CO. It has been posed that gas-phase CO is chemically
consumed and converted into less volatile species through gas-grain processes.
Observations of interstellar ices reveal a CO$_2$ component within H$_2$O ice
suggesting co-formation. The aim of this work is to experimentally verify the
interaction of gas-phase CO with solid-state OH radicals above the sublimation
temperature of CO. Amorphous solid water (ASW) is deposited at 15 K and
followed by vacuum-UV (VUV) irradiation to dissociate H$_2$O and create OH
radicals. Gas-phase CO is simultaneously admitted and only adsorbs with a short
residence time on the ASW. Products in the solid state are studied with
infrared spectroscopy and once released into the gas phase with mass
spectrometry. Results show that gas-phase CO is converted into CO$_2$, with an
efficiency of 7-27%, when interacting with VUV irradiated ASW. Between 40 and
90 K, CO$_2$ production is constant, above 90 K, O$_2$ production takes over.
In the temperature range of 40-60 K, the CO$_2$ remains in the solid state,
while at temperatures $\geq$ 70 K the formed CO$_2$ is released into the gas
phase. We conclude that gas-phase CO reacts with solid-state OH radicals above
its sublimation temperature. This gas-phase CO and solid-state OH radical
interaction could explain the observed CO$_2$ embedded in water-rich ices. It
may also contribute to the observed lack of gas-phase CO in planet-forming
disks, as previously suggested. Our experiments indicate a lower water ice
dissociation efficiency than originally adopted in model descriptions of
planet-forming disks and molecular clouds. Incorporation of the reduced water
ice dissociation and increased binding energy of CO on a water ice surfaces in
these models would allow investigation of this gas-grain interaction to its
full extend.

orders of magnitude. Empirical correlations among such parameters have been
identified during the prompt phase, with direct implications on GRB models. In
this work, we use the PSLab open-access code, developed for IceCube data
analyses, to search for individual neutrino emission from the prompt and
afterglow phases of selected GRBs, and for stacking emission from the ensemble
of such GRBs. For the afterglow phase, we focus in particular on GRBs with
X-ray flares and plateaus. While past stacking searches assumed the same GRB
fluence at Earth, we present a stacking scheme based on physically motivated
GRB weights. Moreover, we conceive a new methodology for the prompt phase that
uses the empirical correlations to infer the GRB luminosity and Lorentz factor,
when redshift measurements are not available. We do not observe any significant

lifetimes exists whenever scattering is restricted to inversion-symmetric Fermi
surfaces, and should thus be a generic feature of two-dimensional Fermi
liquids. It implies an additional unanticipated ""tomographic"" transport regime
(in between the standard collisionless and hydrodynamic regimes) in which
even-parity modes are overdamped while odd-parity modes are collisionless. We
derive expressions for both the longitudinal and the transverse conductivity
and discuss the collective mode spectrum along the
collisionless-tomographic-hydrodynamic crossover. Longitudinal modes cross over
from zero sound in the collisionless regime to hydrodynamic first sound in the
tomographic and hydrodynamic regime, where odd-parity damping appears as a
subleading correction to the lifetime. In charged Fermi liquids with long-range
Coulomb coupling, these modes reduce to plasmons with a strongly suppressed
odd-parity correction to the damping. The transverse response, by contrast, has
a specific tomographic transport regime with two imaginary odd-parity modes,
one of which requires a finite repulsive interaction, distinct from both the
shear sound in the collisionless regime and an overdamped diffusive current
mode in the hydrodynamic limit. Our work demonstrates that there are deep
many-body aspects of interacting Fermi liquids, which are often thought to be
well understood theoretically, remaining unexplored.

greatest experimental challenges in the field of unconventional

the internal structure of the order parameter. We measure the Little-Parks
effect to provide clear evidence of an unconventional superconducting order
parameter in 4Hb-TaS$_2$. Namely, we find a $\pi$-shift in the
transition-temperature oscillations of rings made of a single crystal. We argue
that such an effect can only occur if the underlying order parameter belongs to
a two-dimensional representation, in other words there are two degenerate order
parameters right at the transition. Additionally, we show that $T_c$ is
enhanced as a function of the out-of-plane field when a constant in-plane field
is applied. Such an increase is consistent with a chiral state, which again, in
general only emerges from a two-component order parameter. In combination with
previous experiments, our results strongly indicate that 4Hb-TaS$_2$ indeed
realizes a chiral superconductor.

Carbon monoxide (CO) gas is often used to constrain disk properties (3).
However, estimates show that the CO gas abundance in disks is depleted relative
to expected values (4,5,6,7), and models of various disk processes impacting
the CO abundance could not explain this depletion on observed 1Myr timescales
(8,9,10,11,12,13,14). Here we demonstrate that surface energy effects on
particles in disks, such as the Kelvin effect, that arise when ice
heterogeneously nucleates onto an existing particle can efficiently trap CO in
its ice phase. In previous ice formation models, CO gas was released when small
ice-coated particles were lofted to warmed disk layers. Our model can reproduce
the observed abundance, distribution and time evolution of gaseous CO in the
four most studied protoplanetary disks (7). We constrain the solid and gaseous

progress of a wound determines the optimal approach to care. However, the
heterogeneity of burn wounds often complicates wound assessment, causing
inaccurate wound evaluation and ineffective treatment. Traditional wound
assessment methods such as Gross Area Reduction (GAR) and Percentage Area
Reduction (PAR) are prone to misinterpretation, due to irregular results.
Inaccurate wound assessment leads to higher rates of death and life-long
physical and psychological morbidities in burn patients, especially in
low-income communities that lack specialty care and medical resources.
Therefore, I propose a novel approach to wound assessment: wound healing from
the biophysical perspective of collective cell migration by analyzing cell
packing behavior. This approach was modeled through Voronoi Tessellation
simulations and applied to a wound healing system, where changes in the cell
morphology parameters of aspect ratio and shape index were plotted over time to
numerically evaluate the geometry of different cell migration packing patterns.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of measuring aspect ratio,
as a reduction in aspect ratio indicates that cell shapes become increasingly
rounded throughout wound closure. This is further proven when considering
physical principles in wound healing and changes in cell elongation. By placing
a microscope objective on a phone camera, it is possible to directly examine
any wound, with the calculations done on the phone as well. This efficient and
accurate mechanism can be especially useful in low-resource communities, as it
is accessible regardless of technical or medical background.

a photonic integrated circuit to a free-space coupling chip with different
designs of low-loss meta-optics at a wavelength of 780 nm. We show that
robustness and fidelity of the designed optical functions can be achieved
without prior precise characterization of the free-space input nor stringent

diffraction limited spot of approximately 3 micron for a hyperboloid metalens
of numerical aperture 0.15 was achieved despite an input Gaussian elliptical
deformation of up to 35% and misalignments of the components of up to 20
micron. A holographic display with a peak signal-to-noise ratio of more than 10
compared to its ground truth is also reported using this platform making this
work the first interface to shape photonic integrated modes into free space
using different diffractive optical functions.

1I/2017 U1 (`Oumuamua) by making comparisons between physical models and
observational constraints. These analyses can be generalized for future surveys
of `Oumuamua-like objects. The light sail goes through a drift in the
interstellar space due to the magnetic field and gas atoms, which poses
challenges to the navigation system. When the light sail enters the inner solar
system, the sideways radiation pressure leads to a considerable non-radial
displacement. The immensely high dimensional ratio and the tumbling motion
could cause a light curve with an extremely large amplitude and could even make
the light sail invisible from time to time. These observational features allow
us to examine the light sail scenario of interstellar objects.
  Our results show that the drift of the freely rotating light sail in the
interstellar medium is $\sim 100\,$au even if the travel distance is only 1 pc.
The probability is < 1.5\% for the expected brightness modulation of the light
sail to match with `Oumuamua's observed variation amplitude ($\sim$ 2.5 -- 3).
In addition, the probability is 0.4% for the tumbling light-sail to be visible
(brighter than V=27) in all 55 observations spread over two months after
discovery. Radiation pressure could cause a larger displacement that is normal
to the orbital plane for a lightsail than that for `Oumuamua. Also, the ratio
of anti-solar to sideways acceleration of `Oumuamua deviates from that of the
light sail by ~ 1.5{\sigma}. We suggest that `Oumuamua is unlikely a light
sail. The dynamics of an intruding light sail, if exist, has distinct
observational signatures, which can be quantitatively identified and analyzed
with our methods in future surveys.

Earth system states at time scales from decades to centuries, especially in
response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas release. State-of-the-art ESMs can
reproduce the observational global mean temperature anomalies of the last 150
years. Nevertheless, ESMs need further improvements, most importantly regarding
(i) the large spread in their estimates of climate sensitivity, i.e., the
temperature response to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases, (ii) the
modeled spatial patterns of key variables such as temperature and
precipitation, (iii) their representation of extreme weather events, and (iv)
their representation of multistable Earth system components and their ability
to predict associated abrupt transitions. Here, we argue that making ESMs
automatically differentiable has huge potential to advance ESMs, especially
with respect to these key shortcomings. First, automatic differentiability
would allow objective calibration of ESMs, i.e., the selection of optimal
values with respect to a cost function for a large number of free parameters,
which are currently tuned mostly manually. Second, recent advances in Machine
Learning (ML) and in the amount, accuracy, and resolution of observational data
promise to be helpful with at least some of the above aspects because ML may be
used to incorporate additional information from observations into ESMs.
Automatic differentiability is an essential ingredient in the construction of
such hybrid models, combining process-based ESMs with ML components. We
document recent work showcasing the potential of automatic differentiation for
a new generation of substantially improved, data-informed ESMs.

fitting the gravitational potential of the Milky Way to the stellar kinematics
and densities from Gaia data. Using the Besancon Galaxy Model we derive a
potential and the disc stellar distribution functions are computed based on
three integrals of motion to model stationary stellar discs. The gravitational
potential and the stellar distribution functions are built self-consistently,
and then adjusted to be in agreement with the kinematics and the density
distributions obtained from Gaia observations. A Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) is used to fit the free parameters of the dynamical model to Gaia
parallax and proper motion distributions.
  The fit is done on several sets of Gaia eDR3 data, widely spread in
longitudes and latitudes. We are able to determine the velocity dispersion
ellipsoid and its tilt for sub-components of different ages, both varying with
R and z. The density laws and their radial scale lengths, for the thin and
thick disc populations are also obtained self-consistently. This new model has
some interesting characteristics, such as a flaring thin disc. The thick disc
is found to present very distinctive characteristics from the old thin disc,
both in density and kinematics. This well supports the idea that thin and thick
discs were formed in distinct scenarios as the density and kinematics
transition between them is found to be abrupt. The dark matter halo is shown to
be nearly spherical. We also derive the Solar motion to be (10.79 $\pm$ 0.56,
11.06 $\pm$ 0.94, 7.66 $\pm$ 0.43) km/s, in good agreement with recent studies.
The resulting fully self-consistent gravitational potential, still
axisymmetric, is a good approximation of a smooth mass distribution in the
Milky Way and can be used for further studies, including to compute orbits for
real stars in our Galaxy (abridged).

has been infused into a search algorithm, the so-called active information.
This is rephrased as a test of fine-tuning, where tuning corresponds to the
amount of pre-specified knowledge that the algorithm makes use of in order to
reach a certain target. A function $f$ quantifies specificity for each possible
outcome $x$ of a search, so that the target of the algorithm is a set of highly
specified states, whereas fine-tuning occurs if it is much more likely for the
algorithm to reach the target than by chance. The distribution of a random
outcome $X$ of the algorithm involves a parameter $\theta$ that quantifies how
much background information that has been infused. A simple choice of this
parameter is to use $\theta f$ in order to exponentially tilt the distribution
of the outcome of the search algorithm under the null distribution of no
tuning, so that an exponential family of distributions is obtained. Such
algorithms are obtained by iterating a Metropolis-Hastings type of Markov
chain, and this makes it possible to compute the their active information under
equilibrium and non-equilibrium of the Markov chain, with or without stopping
when the targeted set of fine-tuned states has been reached. Other choices of
tuning parameters $\theta$ are discussed as well. Nonparametric and parametric
estimators of active information and tests of fine-tuning are developed when
repeated and independent outcomes of the algorithm are available. The theory is
illustrated with examples from cosmology, student learning, reinforcement
learning, a Moran type model of population genetics, and evolutionary
programming.

coefficients become known only recently when waves propagate at oblique angles

possible by a rigorous protocol: On the theory side, the initial boundary value
problem of linearized three-wave equations is solved, and the transient-time
solutions allow effects of growth and damping to be distinguished. On the
simulation side, parameters are carefully chosen and calibration runs are
performed to ensure that stimulated runs are well controlled. Fitting
simulation data to analytical solutions yields numerical growth rates, which
match theory predictions within error bars. Although warm-fluid theory is found
to be valid for a wide parameter range, genuine kinetic effects have also been

chaos~[F.~Haake et al., \emph{Quantum Signatures of Chaos (Springer Series in

quantum chaos in the kicked top can be related to the proliferation of Trotter
errors in digital quantum simulation (DQS) of collective spin systems.
Specifically, the proliferation of Trotter errors becomes manifest in
expectation values of few-body observables strongly deviating from the target
dynamics above a critical Trotter step, where the spectral statistics of the
Floquet operator of the kicked top can be predicted by random matrix theory. In
this work, we study these phenomena in the framework of Hamiltonian learning
(HL). We show how a recently developed Hamiltonian learning protocol can be
employed to reconstruct the generator of the stroboscopic dynamics, i.e., the
Floquet Hamiltonian, of the kicked top. We further show how the proliferation
of Trotter errors is revealed by HL as the transition to a regime in which the
dynamics cannot be approximately described by a low-order truncation of the
Floquet-Magnus expansion. This opens up new experimental possibilities for the
analysis of Trotter errors on the level of the generator of the implemented
dynamics, that can be generalized to the DQS of quantum many-body systems in a
scalable way. This paper is in memory of our colleague and friend Fritz Haake.

therefore the deep learning architectures are often susceptible to adversarial
attacks. Adversarial attacks are often obtained by making subtle perturbations
to normal images, which are mostly imperceptible to humans, but can seriously
confuse the state-of-the-art machine learning models. We propose a framework,
named APuDAE, leveraging Denoising AutoEncoders (DAEs) to purify these samples
by using them in an adaptive way and thus improve the classification accuracy
of the target classifier networks that have been attacked. We also show how
using DAEs adaptively instead of using them directly, improves classification
accuracy further and is more robust to the possibility of designing adaptive
attacks to fool them. We demonstrate our results over MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet

cases better performance to the baseline methods in purifying adversaries. We
also design adaptive attack specifically designed to attack our purifying model

water. The interaction of clay minerals in mud gives rise to complex
rheological behaviors, such as yield stress, thixotropy and viscoelasticity.
Here, we experimentally examine the flow behaviors of kaolinite clay
suspensions, a model mud, using steady shear rheometry. The flow curves exhibit
both yield stress and rheological hysteresis behaviors for various kaolinite
volume fractions ($\phi_k$). Further understanding of these behaviors requires
fitting to existing constitutive models, which is challenging due to numerous
fitting parameters. To this end, we employ a Bayesian inference method, Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), to fit the experimental flow curves to a
microstructural viscoelastic model. The method allows us to estimate the
rheological properties of the clay suspensions, such as viscosity, yield
stress, and relaxation time scales. The comparison of the inherent relaxation
time scales suggests that kaolinite clay suspensions are strongly viscoelastic
and weakly thixotropic at relatively low $\phi_k$, while being almost inelastic
and purely thixotropic at high $\phi_k$. Overall, our results provide a
framework for predictive model fitting to elucidate the rheological behaviors
of natural materials and other structured fluids.

Furthermore, wireless spectrum is increasingly scarce as demand for wireless
services develops, demanding imaginative approaches to increase capacity within
a limited spectral resource in order to meet service demands. In this article,
the modified symbol time compression (M-STC) technique is suggested to paves
the way for 5G networks and beyond to enhance the capacity and throughput. The
M-STC method is a compressed signal waveform technique that increases the
capacity by compressing the occupied bandwidth without increasing the
complexity, losing data throughput or bit error rate (BER) performance. A
comparative analysis is provided between the traditional orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) system, OFDM using conventional symbol time
compression (C-STC-OFDM) and OFDM using the proposed technique (M-STC-OFDM).
The simulation results using Matlab-2021a show that the suggested method,
M-STC-OFDM, drastically lowers the time needed for each OFDM signal by 75%. As
a consequence, the M-STC-OFDM system decreases bandwidth (BW) by 75% when
compared to a standard OFDM system (BW_OFDM = 180 kHz and BW_M-STC-OFDM = 45
kHz), while the C-STC-OFDM system reduces BW by 50% (BW_C-STC-OFDM = 90 kHz).
Furthermore, using the M-STC-OFDM system reduces peak to average-power-ratio

compared to C-STC-OFDM with no BER deterioration. Moreover, as compared to the

environment, such as nondeterministic surrounding traffic participants in
autonomous driving and high-speed racing. Unfortunately, delays are typically
not considered during the conventional controller design or learning-enabled
controller training phases prior to deployment in the physical world. In this
paper, the computation delay from nonlinear optimization for motion planning
and control, as well as other unavoidable delays caused by actuators, are
addressed systematically and unifiedly. To deal with all these delays, in our
framework: 1) we propose a new filtering approach with no prior knowledge of
dynamics and disturbance distribution to adaptively and safely estimate the
time-variant computation delay; 2) we model actuation dynamics for steering
delay; 3) all the constrained optimization is realized in a robust tube model
predictive controller. For the application merits, we demonstrate that our
approach is suitable for both autonomous driving and autonomous racing. Our
approach is a novel design for a standalone delay compensation controller. In
addition, in the case that a learning-enabled controller assuming no delay
works as a primary controller, our approach serves as the primary controller's
safety guard.

article, we propose a method for fitting the multinomial logistic regression
model in high dimensions that addresses this problem in a unified and

which predictors distinguish between coarse categories but not fine categories,
which predictors distinguish between fine categories, and which predictors are
irrelevant. For model fitting, we propose a scalable algorithm that can be
applied when the coarse categories are defined by either overlapping or
nonoverlapping sets of fine categories. Statistical properties of our method
reveal that it can take advantage of this multiresolution structure in a way
existing estimators cannot. We use our method to model cell type probabilities

Our fitted model provides novel biological insights which may be useful for

strong and apparent weak lensing from the outflow of their ionized companions.
Lensing can be a powerful probe of the ionized plasma, with the strongest
lenses potentially resolving emission regions of pulsars. Understanding lensing
in the `laboratory-like' conditions of an eclipsing pulsar may be analogously
applied to fast radio bursts, many of which reside in dense, magnetized
environments. We examined variable dispersion measure (DM), absorption,
scattering, and flux density in the original Black Widow pulsar PSR B1957+20
through an eclipse at the Arecibo Observatory at 327 MHz. We discovered clear
evidence of the two regimes of lensing, strong and apparent weak. We show that
the flux density variations in the apparently weak lensing regime can be
modeled directly from variations of DM, using geometric optics. The mean
effective velocities in the ingress, $954\pm 99$ km/s, and egress $604\pm 47$
km/s cannot be explained by orbital motions alone, but are consistent with
significant outflow velocity of material from the companion. We also show that
geometric optics can predict when and where the lensing regime-change between
weak and strong occurs, and argue that the apparent weak lensing is due to
averaging many images. Our framework can be applied in any source with variable
electron columns, measuring their relative velocities and distances. In other
eclipsing pulsars, this provides a unique opportunity to measure companion
outflow velocity, predict regions of weak and strong lensing, and in principle
independently constrain orbital inclinations.

These developments represent the first step toward a more complete modeling of
dust-driven winds emanating from AGB stars. Methods. The AGB outflow is modeled
by injecting the SPH particles from a spherical inner boundary. This boundary
is a series of concentric shells, with the AGB star at its center, and the
particles are positioned on these shells on the vertices of an isocahedron
geodesic surface. The outermost shell is ejected with a predefined radial
velocity, and subsequent lower shells replenish the ejected ones, all rotated
randomly to improve the isotropy of the outflow. The physical properties of the
particles on these shells are set by solving the 1D analytic steady wind
equations. The formation of dust is calculated starting from a compact chemical
network for carbon-rich material, which creates the building blocks of the
solid-state particles. Subsequently, the theory of the moments is used to
obtain dust growth rates, without requiring knowledge on the grain size
distribution. Results. We tested our implementation against a series of 1D
reference solutions. We demonstrate that our method is able to reproduce
Parker-type wind solutions. For the trans-sonic solution, small oscillations
are present in the vicinity of the sonic point, but these do not impact the
trans-sonic passage or terminal wind velocity. Supersonic solutions always
compare nicely with 1D analytic profiles. We also tested our implementation of
dust using two formalisms: an analytic prescription for the opacity devised by
Bowen and the full treatment of carbon-dust formation. Both simulations
reproduce the 1D analytic solution displaying the expected additional
acceleration when the gas temperature falls below the condensation temperature.

fields of computer science and statistical mechanics. In computer science, it
is called the Maximum Cut problem, one of the famous twenty-one Karp's original
NP-hard problems, while the same object from Physics is called the Ising Spin
Glass model. This model of a rich structure often appears as a reduction or
reformulation of real-world problems from computer science, physics and
engineering. However, solving this model exactly (finding the maximal cut or
the ground state) is likely to stay an intractable problem (unless $\textit{P}
= \textit{NP}$) and requires the development of ad-hoc heuristics for every
particular family of instances.
  One of the bright and beautiful connections between discrete and continuous
optimization is a Semidefinite Programming-based rounding scheme for Maximum
Cut. This procedure allows us to find a provably near-optimal solution;
moreover, this method is conjectured to be the best possible in polynomial
time. In the first two chapters of this thesis, we investigate local non-convex
heuristics intended to improve the rounding scheme.
  In the last chapter of this thesis, we make one step further and aim to
control the solution of the problem we wanted to solve in previous chapters. We
formulate a bi-level optimization problem over the Ising model where we want to
tweak the interactions as little as possible so that the ground state of the
resulting Ising model satisfies the desired criteria. This kind of problem
arises in pandemic modeling. We show that when the interactions are
non-negative, our bi-level optimization is solvable in polynomial time using
convex programming.

for a superconductor in a situation when superconductivity emerges out of a
non-Fermi liquid due to pairing mediated by a massless boson. This is the case
for electronic-mediated pairing near a quantum-critical point in a metal, for
pairing in SYK-type models, and for phonon-mediated pairing in the properly
defined limit, when the dressed Debye frequency vanishes. We consider a subset
of these quantum-critical models, in which the pairing in a channel with a
proper spatial symmetry is described by an effective $0+1$ dimensional model
with the effective dynamical interaction $V(\Omega_m) = {\bar
g}^\gamma/|\Omega_m|^\gamma$, where $\gamma$ is model-specific (the
$\gamma$-model). In previous papers, we argued that the pairing in the $\gamma$
model is qualitatively different from that in a Fermi liquid, and the gap
equation at $T=0$ has an infinite number of topologically distinct solutions,
$\Delta_n (\omega_m)$, where an integer $n$, running between $0$ and infinity,
is the number of zeros of $\Delta_n (\omega_m)$ on the positive Matsubara axis.
This gives rise to the set of extrema of $E_c$ at $E_{c,n}$, of which $E_{c,0}$
is the global minimum. The spectrum $E_{c,n}$ is discrete for a generic $\gamma
<2$, but becomes continuous at $\gamma = 2-0$. Here, we discuss in more detail
the profile of the condensation energy near each $E_{c,n}$ and the
transformation from a discrete to a continuous spectrum at $\gamma \to 2$. We
also discuss the free energy and the specific heat of the $\gamma$-model in the
normal state.

entanglement patterns in terms of topological equivalence classes. In the
bipartite case a classification equivalent to the one by Stochastic Local
Operations and Classical Communication (SLOCC) is constructed by restricting to
a simple class of connectivity diagrams. Such diagrams characterize quantum
states of TQFT up to braiding and tangling of the ``connectome.'' In the
multipartite case the same restricted topological classification only captures
a part of the SLOCC classes, in particular, it does not see the W entanglement
of three qubits. Nonlocal braiding of connections may solve the problem, but no
finite classification is attempted in this case. Despite incompleteness, the
connectome classification has a straightforward generalization to any number
and dimension of parties and has a very intuitive interpretation, which might
be useful for understanding specific properties of entanglement and for design
of new quantum resources.

propose six new regressors provably-robust to poisoning attacks. To the extent

We introduce a tighter analysis of model robustness, which in many cases
results in significantly improved certified guarantees. Lastly, we empirically
demonstrate our approaches' effectiveness on both regression and classification

galaxies. Galactic outflows driven by stellar feedback or supermassive black
hole accretion are often invoked to regulate the amount of cold molecular gas
available for future star formation, but may not be the only relevant quenching
processes in all galaxies. We present the discovery of vast molecular tidal
features extending up to 64 kpc outside of a massive z=0.646 post-starburst
galaxy that recently concluded its primary star-forming episode. The tidal
tails contain (1.2 +/- 0.1)x10^10 Msun of molecular gas, 47 +/- 5 % of the
total cold gas reservoir of the system. Both the scale and magnitude of the
molecular tidal features are unprecedented compared to all known nearby or
high-redshift merging systems. We infer that the cold gas was stripped from the
host galaxies during the merger, which is most likely responsible for
triggering the initial burst phase and the subsequent suppression of star
formation. While only a single example, this result shows that galaxy mergers
can regulate the cold gas contents in distant galaxies by directly removing a
large fraction of the molecular gas fuel, and plausibly suppress star formation
directly, a qualitatively different physical mechanism than feedback-driven
outflows.

the cuprates, has been found in many quantum materials, including pnictides,
heavy fermions and magic angle double layer graphene. One suggested origin of
this universality is that it stems from the presence of a quantum critical
point (QCP), i.e., a phase transition at zero temperature ruled by quantum
fluctuations, in contrast to ordinary phase transitions ruled by thermal
fluctuations. Although in cuprates superconductivity hinders the direct
observation of the QCP phenomenology at low temperatures, indirect evidence
comes from the identification of fluctuations compatible with the strange metal
phase at higher temperatures. Here we show that the recently discovered charge
density fluctuations (CDF) possess the right properties to be associated to a
quantum phase transition. By using resonant x-ray scattering, we have studied
the CDF in two families of cuprate superconductors over a wide range of doping
$p$, up to $p$ = 0.22. We show that at $p^*\approx$0.19, corresponding to the
putative QCP, the CDF intensity is the strongest, and the characteristic energy
$\Delta$ is the smallest, marking a wedge-shaped region in the phase diagram
indicative of a quantum critical behavior, although with anomalous properties.
These results support the leading role of charge order in driving the
unconventional phenomenology of the strange metal and add new elements for the
understanding of high critical temperature superconductivity.

distances, the METRIC VIOLATION DISTANCE (MVD) problem asks to compute the
$\ell_0$ distance between $x$ and the metric cone; i.e., modify the minimum
number of entries of $x$ to make it a metric. Due to its large number of
applications in various data analysis and optimization tasks, this problem has
been actively studied recently.
  We present an $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm for MVD, exponentially
improving the previous best approximation ratio of $O(OPT^{1/3})$ of Fan et al.
[ SODA, 2018]. Furthermore, a major strength of our algorithm is its simplicity
and running time. We also study the related problem of ULTRAMETRIC VIOLATION
DISTANCE (UMVD), where the goal is to compute the $\ell_0$ distance to the cone
of ultrametrics, and achieve a constant factor approximation algorithm. The
UMVD can be regarded as an extension of the problem of fitting ultrametrics
studied by Ailon and Charikar [SIAM J. Computing, 2011] and by Cohen-Addad et
al. [FOCS, 2021] from $\ell_1$ norm to $\ell_0$ norm. We show that this problem
can be favorably interpreted as an instance of Correlation Clustering with an
additional hierarchical structure, which we solve using a new
$O(1)$-approximation algorithm for correlation clustering that has the
structural property that it outputs a refinement of the optimum clusters. An
algorithm satisfying such a property can be considered of independent interest.
We also provide an $O(\log n \log \log n)$ approximation algorithm for weighted
instances. Finally, we investigate the complementary version of these problems
where one aims at choosing a maximum number of entries of $x$ forming an
(ultra-)metric. In stark contrast with the minimization versions, we prove that
these maximization versions are hard to approximate within any constant factor
assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.

measures $\nu$ and $\tilde{\nu}$ with finite mean, if $\tilde{\nu}$ is strictly
more variable than $\nu$ and $\nu$ is subcritical in an appropriate sense, the
time constant associated to $\tilde{\nu}$ is strictly smaller than the time
constant associated to $\nu$. In this paper, an analogous result is proven for
(not necessarily almost-transitive) graphs of strict polynomial growth and for
bounded degree graphs quasi-isometric to trees which satisfy a certain
geometric condition we call ""admitting detours."" It is also proven that if a
bounded degree graph does not admit detours, then such a strict monotonicity
theorem with respect to variability cannot hold. Large classes of graphs are
shown to admit detours, and we conclude that for example any Cayley graph of a
virtually nilpotent group which is not isomorphic to the standard Cayley graph
of $\mathbb{Z}$ satisfies strict monotonicity with respect to variability, as
does any Cayley graph of $F \rtimes F_k$, $F$ a nontrivial finite group and
$F_k$ a free group.
  Moreover, it is proven that for graphs of strict polynomial growth and
bounded degree graphs quasi-isometric to trees, if the weight measure is
subcritical in an appropriate sense, then it is ""absolutely continuous with

strict monotonicity theorem with respect to stochastic domination of measures,

advantage, their performance in the quantum domain has not yet been evaluated.
Particularly, it is not clear how the quantum noise introduced by vacuum
fluctuations will affect their operation. Here, we investigate this problem by
considering three archetypal EPOAs structures that rely either on
unidirectional coupling, parity-time (PT) symmetry, or particle-hole symmetry
for implementing the exceptional point (EP). By using the Heisenberg-Langevin
formalism, we calculate the added quantum noise in each of these devices and
compare it with that of a quantum-limited amplifier scheme that does not
involve any exceptional points. Our analysis reveals several interesting
results: most notably that while the quantum noise of certain EPOAs can be
comparable to those associated with conventional amplifier systems, in general
the noise does not follow a universal scaling as a function of the exceptional
point but rather varies from one implementation to another.

lightweight fine-tuning, which freezes most of the model's parameters, allowing
tuning of the token embeddings and softmax layer only or the final layer alone;
(iii) prefix tuning, which keeps model parameters frozen, but optimizes a small
project-specific prefix vector. Each of these techniques offers a trade-off in
total compute cost and predictive performance, which we evaluate by code and
task-specific metrics, training time, and total computational operations. We

Frank-Wolfe methods typically grows linearly in the number of data observations
$n$. This is in stark contrast to the case for typical stochastic projection

Variational quantum simulation (VQS) gives us a tool to achieve the goal in

the execution of VQS becomes more and more challenging. One of the most severe
challenges is the drastic increase in the number of measurements; for example,
the number of measurements tends to increase by the fourth power of the number
of qubits in a quantum simulation with a chemical Hamiltonian. This work aims
to dramatically decrease the number of measurements in VQS by recently proposed
shadow-based strategies such as classical shadow and derandomization. Even
though previous literature shows that shadow-based strategies successfully
optimize measurements in the variational quantum optimization (VQO), how to
apply them to VQS was unclear due to the gap between VQO and VQS in measuring
observables. In this paper, we bridge the gap by changing the way of measuring
observables in VQS and propose an algorithm to optimize measurements in VQS by
shadow-based strategies. Our theoretical analysis not only reveals the
advantage of using our algorithm in VQS but theoretically supports using
shadow-based strategies in VQO, whose advantage has only been given
numerically. Additionally, our numerical experiment shows the validity of using
our algorithm with a quantum chemical system.

parameters of the fixed effects. Existing methods often require strong
distributional assumptions on the random effects and random errors. In this
paper, we develop empirical likelihood-based methods for the inference of the
variance components in the presence of fixed effects. A nonparametric version
of the Wilks' theorem for the proposed empirical likelihood ratio statistics

$\tau$-tilting finite algebras using IE-closed subcategories. For the
hereditary case, we show that IE-closed subcategories can be classified by twin
rigid modules, pairs of rigid modules satisfying some homological conditions.

animal behaviors from their poses. Compared to the number of species we know

them, while building comprehensive large-scale datasets is prohibitively
expensive. Here, we present a very data efficient strategy targeted for pose
estimation in quadrupeds that requires only a small amount of real images from
the target animal. It is confirmed that fine-tuning a backbone network with
pretrained weights on generic image datasets such as ImageNet can mitigate the
high demand for target animal pose data and shorten the training time by
learning the the prior knowledge of object segmentation and keypoint estimation
in advance. However, when faced with serious data scarcity (i.e., $<10^2$ real
images), the model performance stays unsatisfactory, particularly for limbs
with considerable flexibility and several comparable parts. We therefore
introduce a prior-aware synthetic animal data generation pipeline called PASyn
to augment the animal pose data essential for robust pose estimation. PASyn
generates a probabilistically-valid synthetic pose dataset, SynAP, through
training a variational generative model on several animated 3D animal models.
In addition, a style transfer strategy is utilized to blend the synthetic
animal image into the real backgrounds. We evaluate the improvement made by our
approach with three popular backbone networks and test their pose estimation
accuracy on publicly available animal pose images as well as collected from
real animals in a zoo.

Based on the X-ray spectroscopy, we evaluate thermal parameters such as the
ambient density and temperature, and non-thermal parameters such as the
power-law flux and index. From the flux decrease in time of several non-thermal
filaments, we estimate the magnetic field amplitudes to be $\sim

parameter correlations. We find that the synchrotron emission from
thermal-dominated filaments is correlated with the ambient density $n_{\rm e}$

$\text{(power-law index)} \propto n_{\rm e}^{0.38 \pm 0.10}$, not or only

when black-box functions are expensive to evaluate, the standard approach based
on type II maximum likelihood (ML-II) may fail and result in disappointing
performance in small-sample trials. The paper provides three compelling reasons
to adopt fully Bayesian optimisation (FBO) as an alternative. First, failures
of ML-II are more commonplace than implied by the existing studies using the
contrived settings. Second, FBO is more robust than ML-II, and the price of
robustness is almost trivial. Third, FBO has become simple to implement and
fast enough to be practical. The paper supports the argument using relevant
experiments, which reflect the current practice regarding models, algorithms,

researchers should consider adopting FBO for their applications so that they
can guard against potential failures that end up wasting precious research

supermassive black hole and is destroyed by tidal gravitational forces. Radio
observations of TDEs trace synchrotron emission from outflowing material that
may be ejected from the inner regions of the accretion flow around the SMBH or
by the tidal debris stream. Radio detections of tidal disruption events are
rare, but provide crucial information about the launching of jets and outflows
from supermassive black holes and the circumnuclear environment in galaxies.
Here we present the radio detection of the TDE AT2020opy, including three
epochs of radio observations taken with the Karl G. Jansky's Very Large Array
(VLA), MeerKAT, and upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio telescope. AT2020opy is the
most distant thermal TDE with radio emission reported to date, and from
modelling the evolving synchrotron spectra we deduce that the host galaxy has a
more dense circumnuclear medium than other thermal TDEs detected in the radio
band. Based on an equipartition analysis of the synchrotron spectral properties
of the event, we conclude that the radio-emitting outflow was likely launched
approximately at the time of, or just after, the initial optical flare. We find
no evidence for relativistic motion of the outflow. The high luminosity of this
event supports that a dense circumnuclear medium of the host galaxy produces
brighter radio emission that rises to a peak more quickly than in galaxies with
lower central densities.

the architecture of the neural network model significantly impacts the

model architecture and a split point to achieve higher accuracy while meeting
latency requirements (i.e., smaller total latency of computation and
communication than a certain threshold). NASC employs a one-shot NAS that does
not require repeating model training for a computationally efficient

half-space coverage to full-space coverage by simultaneously transmitting and

rate of all users, where the energy transfer time, transmit power and CPU
frequencies of users, and the configuration design of STAR-RIS are jointly
optimized. Considering the characteristics of STAR-RIS, three operating
protocols, namely energy splitting (ES), mode switching (MS), and time
splitting (TS) are studied, respectively. For the ES protocol, based on the
penalty method, successive convex approximation (SCA), and the linear search
method, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated non-convex

wherein, by applying a natural set of free operations (called wirings) on many
copies of weakly nonlocal systems, one aims to generate correlations of higher
nonlocal strength. In the simplest Bell scenario, we identify a protocol,
namely, logical OR-AND wiring, that can distil nonlocality to significantly
high degree starting from arbitrarily weak quantum nonlocal correlations. As it
turns out, our protocol has several interesting facets: (i) it demonstrates
that set of distillable quantum correlations has non zero measure in the full
eight-dimensional correlation space, (ii) it can distil quantum Hardy
correlations by preserving its structure, (iii) it shows that (nonlocal)
quantum correlations sufficiently close to the local deterministic points can
be distilled by a significant amount. Finally, we also demonstrate efficacy of
the considered distillation protocol in detecting postquantum correlations.

analysis of second-harmonic (SH) generation from arbitrarily-shaped particles
made of centrosymmetric optical materials. First, the transfer matrix of a
single particle is computed \textit{via} the extended boundary condition
method, in which the electromagnetic fields both at fundamental frequency and
SH are expanded in vector spherical wave functions and the integral formulation
is satisfied away from the surface of the scatterer. We allow for the accurate
physical description of the SH sources by taking into account both local
surface and nonlocal bulk polarization contributions to the nonlinear
polarization density source responsible for the generation of the SH signal in
a particle. This single-particle formalism is then extended to arbitrary
distributions of particles by incorporating into the formalism linear and
nonlinear electromagnetic wave scattering from the particles in the cluster.
Importantly from a practical point of view, our method can be applied to
particles of arbitrary shape made of optical materials characterized by general
frequency-dispersion relations, so that it can describe the linear and
nonlinear optical response of clusters of metallic, semiconductor, or
polaritonic particles, as well as mixtures of such particles. The approach
proposed here is faster and more memory-efficient than well-established
numerical techniques, especially in the analysis of spheroidal particles, due
to the favourable symmetries of spherical wave basis functions used in the wave

keyphrases is an important aspect of this process. Rather than just one, we
propose to use multiple phrase detection models with the goal to produce a more
comprehensive set of keyphrases from the source corpora. Another potential
advantage to this approach is that the union and difference of these sets may
provide automated techniques for identifying and omitting non-specific phrases.
We compare the performance of several phrase detection models, analyze the
keyphrase sets output of each, and calculate lexical diversity of corpora
variants incorporating keyphrases from each model, using four common lexical
diversity metrics.

health effects. There is a need for a portable and cost-effective device for
long-term monitoring and quantification of various bio-aerosols. To address
this need, we present a mobile and cost-effective label-free bio-aerosol sensor
that takes holographic images of flowing particulate matter concentrated by a
virtual impactor, which selectively slows down and guides particles larger than
~6 microns to fly through an imaging window. The flowing particles are
illuminated by a pulsed laser diode, casting their inline holograms on a CMOS
image sensor in a lens-free mobile imaging device. The illumination contains
three short pulses with a negligible shift of the flowing particle within one
pulse, and triplicate holograms of the same particle are recorded at a single
frame before it exits the imaging field-of-view, revealing different
perspectives of each particle. The particles within the virtual impactor are
localized through a differential detection scheme, and a deep neural network
classifies the aerosol type in a label-free manner, based on the acquired
holographic images. We demonstrated the success of this mobile bio-aerosol
detector with a virtual impactor using different types of pollen (i.e.,
bermuda, elm, oak, pine, sycamore, and wheat) and achieved a blind
classification accuracy of 92.91%. This mobile and cost-effective device weighs
~700 g and can be used for label-free sensing and quantification of various
bio-aerosols over extended periods since it is based on a cartridge-free
virtual impactor that does not capture or immobilize particulate matter.

  monitoring submerged shoals",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Optimal sampling strategies are critical for surveys of deeper coral reef and
shoal systems, due to the significant cost of accessing and field sampling
these remote and poorly understood ecosystems. Additionally, well-established
standard diver-based sampling techniques used in shallow reef systems cannot be
deployed because of water depth. Here we develop a Bayesian design strategy to
optimise sampling for a shoal deep reef system using three years of pilot data.
Bayesian designs are generally found by maximising the expectation of a utility
function with respect to the joint distribution of the parameters and the
response conditional on an assumed statistical model. Unfortunately, specifying
such a model a priori is difficult as knowledge of the data generating process
is typically incomplete. To address this, we present an approach to find
Bayesian designs that are robust to unknown model uncertainty. This is achieved
through couching the specified model within a Generalised Additive Modelling
framework and formulating prior information that allows the additive component
to capture discrepancies between what is assumed and the underlying data
generating process. The motivation for this is to enable Bayesian designs to be
found under epistemic model uncertainty; a highly desirable property of
Bayesian designs. Our approach is demonstrated initially on an exemplar design
problem where a theoretic result is derived and used to explore the properties
of optimal designs. We then apply our approach to design future monitoring of
sub-merged shoals off the north-west coast of Australia with the aim of
significantly improving on current monitoring designs.

suggests that $HOCO^+$ is indeed produced from the protonation of $CO_2$
sublimated from ice. The $HOCO^+$ fractional abundances are found to be
$(1-2)\times10^{-9}$ at the outer part of the central molecular zone (CMZ),
while they are lower ($\sim10^{-10}$) near the kinematic center. This peak
fractional abundance at the outer CMZ is comparable to that in the Milky Way
CMZ, and orders of magnitude higher than that in Galactic disk star-forming
regions. From the range of $HOCO^+/CO_2$ ratios suggested from chemical models,
the gas-phase $CO_2$ fractional abundance is estimated to be

examine this approach, we have synthesized several \fex\ lines from two 3D
magnetohydrodynamic simulations, one modeling an emerging flux region and the
second an established mature active region. In addition, we take bound-free
absorption from neutral hydrogen and helium and singly ionised helium into
account. The absorption from cool plasma that occurs at coronal heights has a
significant impact on determining the magnetic field. We investigate in detail
the challenges of using these \fex\ lines to measure the field, considering
their density and temperature dependence. We present a novel approach to
deriving the magnetic field from the MIT using inversions of the differential
emission measure as a function of the temperature, density, and magnetic field.
This approach successfully estimates the magnetic field strength (up to \%18
relative error) in regions that do not suffer from significant absorption and
that have relatively strong coronal magnetic fields ($>250$~G). This method
allows the masking of regions where absorption is significant.

domain model using unlabeled target data and the knowledge of a well-trained
source domain model. Most previous SFUDA works focus on inferring semantics of
target data based on the source knowledge. Without measuring the
transferability of the source knowledge, these methods insufficiently exploit
the source knowledge, and fail to identify the reliability of the inferred
target semantics. However, existing transferability measurements require either
source data or target labels, which are infeasible in SFUDA. To this end,
firstly, we propose a novel Uncertainty-induced Transferability Representation
(UTR), which leverages uncertainty as the tool to analyse the channel-wise
transferability of the source encoder in the absence of the source data and
target labels. The domain-level UTR unravels how transferable the encoder
channels are to the target domain and the instance-level UTR characterizes the
reliability of the inferred target semantics. Secondly, based on the UTR, we
propose a novel Calibrated Adaption Framework (CAF) for SFUDA, including i)the
source knowledge calibration module that guides the target model to learn the
transferable source knowledge and discard the non-transferable one, and ii)the
target semantics calibration module that calibrates the unreliable semantics.
With the help of the calibrated source knowledge and the target semantics, the
model adapts to the target domain safely and ultimately better. We verified the
effectiveness of our method using experimental results and demonstrated that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on the three SFUDA
benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/SPIresearch/UTR.

Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, such as the Major Atmospheric Gamma
Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes and the High Energy Stereoscopic System

achromatic peaks in X-ray and optical bands at $1.4\times10^3$ s and being
classified as low-luminosity GRBs. Previously, we proposed a two-component jet
model, which has `narrow jet' with a small initial opening half-angle
$\theta_0=0.015$ rad and large bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma_0=350$, and `wide
jet' with $\theta_0=0.1$ rad and $\Gamma_0=20$. The narrow jet explained the
early X-ray and optical emissions and apparently small isotropic gamma-ray
energy and peak energy in the off-axis viewing case. Furthermore, the late
X-ray and radio (1.3 and 15.5 GHz) afterglows were emitted from the wide jet.

emission. The multi-wavelength afterglows of GRB 190829A including the VHE
gamma-ray emission are well explained by our two-component jet model. The
afterglow emissions from our two-component jet are also consistent with the
observational results of GRBs 180720B, 190114C and 201216C, when the jets are
viewed on-axis. Furthermore, we discuss the detectability of off-axis orphan
afterglows by the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).

velocity space, the discrete velocity method (DVM) and unified methods can
capture complex and non-equilibrium distribution functions and describe flow
behaviors exactly. The unified methods predict flows from continuum to rarefied
regimes by adopting unified modeling, and they can be further applied to other
multi-scale physics such as radiation heat transfer, phonon heat transfer and
plasma. In the flow field, the concrete dynamic process needs to describe the
gas-gas interaction and gas-surface interaction (GSI). However, in both DVM and
unified methods, only a simple but not accurate GSI is used, which can be
regarded as a Maxwell GSI with a fixed accommodation coefficient of 1 (full
accommodation) at the present stage. To overcome the bottleneck in extending
DVM and unified methods to the numerical experiment and investigate real
multi-scale flow physics, this paper realizes precise GSI in the DVM framework
by constructing the boundary conditions of a concrete Maxwell GSI with an
adjustable accommodation coefficient. In the constructing process, the problems
of macro-conservation and micro-consistency in the DVS at the boundary are well
solved by reflected macroscopic flux and interpolation distribution function
and interpolation error correction, respectively. Meanwhile, considering that
the multi-scale flows in the background of aeronautics and aerospace are often
at supersonic and hypersonic speeds, the unstructured velocity space (UVS) is
essential. From the perspective of generality, the GSI is forced on UVS.
Besides, by combined with the unified method (the unified gas-kinetic scheme in
the paper), the effectiveness and validity of the present GSI on the DVM
framework are verified by a series of simulations.

state and effect spaces of a composite system can allow different possible
mathematical descriptions even when description for the individual systems are
assumed to be quantum. While in one extreme, namely the maximal tensor product
composition, the state space becomes quite exotic and permits composite states
that are not allowed in quantum theory, the other extreme -- minimal tensor
product composition -- contains only separable states and the resulting theory
allows only Bell local correlation. As we show, none of these compositions does
commensurate with information causality, and hence get invalidated to be the
bona-fide description of nature. Information causality, therefore, promises
information theoretic derivation of self-duality of state and effect cones for
composite quantum systems.

However, when the scattering length $a_{0}$ is larger than the radius of the

unity, which cannot be interpreted as a probability. For the systems with
$a_{0}>R$, we need to estimate the compositeness with the correction terms. For

Intra-document context consists of the document title and all the other

evidences which may come from different documents. Then we integrate the
multi-view contextual information to encode the evidence sentences to handle
the task. Our experimental results on FEVER 1.0 shared task show that our IMCI

Tidal and hydrodynamical stripping, prominent in cluster environment, can
remove the peripheral gas of galaxies and star formation may thus be
environmentally suppressed from the outside-in. We revisit the environmental
dependence of the radial gradient of specific star formation rate (sSFR)
profile. We probe the radial gradient by using the archival spectral indices
D4000n and HdA measured from SDSS fiber spectra, to indicate central sSFR, and
the total sSFR from fitting the spectral energy distribution. Despite the low
spatial resolution, the wealth of SDSS data allows to disentangle the
dependences on stellar mass, sSFR, and environment. We find that low-mass
satellite galaxies in the mass range 9 < log M/M_solar < 9.8 on average quench
in more inside-out pattern compared to isolated galaxies matched in mass, sSFR,
and fiber coverage. This environmental effect is particularly strong for
galaxies below the star formation main sequence, and peaks for those in the
core of massive clusters where the phase-space diagram reveals clear links
between the inside-out quenching and orbital properties. Our results suggest
that both tidal and hydrodynamical interactions in cluster environment suppress
the star formation of satellites mainly from the inside-out. As accreted gas of
low angular momentum from hot gas halos is an important source for replenishing
central gas reservoir, we discuss how gas stripping in clusters may lead to
starvation and cause inside-out quenching when the outer star-forming discs are

over indefinite timescales. A system is considered hierarchical if the bodies
can be divided into separate two-body orbits with distinct time- and
length-scales, such that one orbit is only mildly affected by the gravitation
of the other bodies. Previous work has mapped the stability of such systems at
varying resolutions over a limited range of parameters, and attempts have been
made to derive analytic and semi-analytic stability boundary fits to explain
the observed phenomena. Certain regimes are understood relatively well.
However, there are large regions of the parameter space which remain un-mapped,
and for which the stability boundary is poorly understood. We present a
comprehensive numerical study of the stability boundary of hierarchical triples
over a range of initial parameters. Specifically, we consider the mass ratio of
the inner binary to the outer third body ($q_{\rm out}$), mutual inclination
($i$), initial mean anomaly and eccentricity of both the inner and outer
binaries ($e_{\rm in}$ and $e_{\rm out}$ respectively). We fit the dependence
of the stability boundary on $q_{\rm out}$ as a threshold on the ratio of the
inner binary's semi-major axis to the outer binary's pericentre separation
$a_{\rm in}/R_{\rm p, out} \leq 10^{-0.6 + 0.04q_{\rm out}}q_{\rm

suitable interval specified by a pair of (unknown) cut-offs. The most efficient
way of estimating the unknown parameters (i.e., the regression coefficients and

spectroscopy, obtained at the VLT, has recently driven remarkable progress in
strong lensing (SL) modeling of galaxy clusters. From a few tens of multiple
images with photometric redshifts per cluster, a new generation of
high-precision SL models have recently been developed, by exploiting in some
cases over a hundred of spectroscopically confirmed multiple images and cluster
member galaxies. A further step forward is expected with JWST observations of
SL clusters (from hundreds to possibly a thousand of multiple images). In this
context, we present a new, state-of-the-art SL model of the galaxy cluster MACS
J0416.1-2403, utilizing 237 spectroscopically confirmed multiple images, which
is the largest sample of secure multiply lensed sources utilized to date. This
model incorporates stellar kinematics information of 64 cluster galaxies and
the hot-gas mass distribution of the cluster determined from Chandra X-ray
observations. The observed positions of the many multiple images are reproduced
with a remarkable accuracy of 0.43 arcsec. To further assess the reliability of
this lens model and to highlight the improvement over previously published
models, we show the extended surface brightness reconstruction of several
lensed galaxies through a newly developed forward modeling software. The
comparison with other SL models of the same cluster demonstrates that this new
model is better suited to accurately reproduce the positions, shapes and fluxes
of the observed multiple images. Besides a robust characterization of the total
mass distribution of the cluster, our model can provide accurate and precise
magnification maps that are key to studying the intrinsic physical properties
of faint, high-redshift lensed sources. The model is made publicly available

video of the interior of a 3D object, helping surgeons to observe pathological

suffers from heavy noise that mainly arises from the clinical use of a low dose
X-ray, thereby necessitating the technology of fluoroscopy denoising. Such
denoising is challenged by the relative motion between the object being imaged
and the X-ray imaging system. We tackle this challenge by proposing a
self-supervised, three-stage framework that exploits the domain knowledge of
fluoroscopy imaging. (i) Stabilize: we first construct a dynamic panorama based
on optical flow calculation to stabilize the non-stationary background induced
by the motion of the X-ray detector. (ii) Decompose: we then propose a novel
mask-based Robust Principle Component Analysis (RPCA) decomposition method to
separate a video with detector motion into a low-rank background and a sparse
foreground. Such a decomposition accommodates the reading habit of experts.
(iii) Denoise: we finally denoise the background and foreground separately by a
self-supervised learning strategy and fuse the denoised parts into the final
output via a bilateral, spatiotemporal filter. To assess the effectiveness of
our work, we curate a dedicated fluoroscopy dataset of 27 videos (1,568 frames)

this paper, we present a new method, called Social Motion Transformer
(SoMoFormer), for multi-person 3D pose forecasting. Our transformer
architecture uniquely models human motion input as a joint sequence rather than
a time sequence, allowing us to perform attention over joints while predicting
an entire future motion sequence for each joint in parallel. We show that with
this problem reformulation, SoMoFormer naturally extends to multi-person scenes
by using the joints of all people in a scene as input queries. Using learned
embeddings to denote the type of joint, person identity, and global position,
our model learns the relationships between joints and between people, attending
more strongly to joints from the same or nearby people. SoMoFormer outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for long-term motion prediction on the SoMoF benchmark

paper, we propose to sense the 3D structure of spacecraft using light detection
and ranging sensor (LIDAR) and a monocular camera. To this end, Spacecraft
Depth Completion Network (SDCNet) is proposed to recover the dense depth map
based on gray image and sparse depth map. Specifically, SDCNet decomposes the
object-level spacecraft depth completion task into foreground segmentation
subtask and foreground depth completion subtask, which segments the spacecraft
region first and then performs depth completion on the segmented foreground
area. In this way, the background interference to foreground spacecraft depth
completion is effectively avoided. Moreover, an attention-based feature fusion
module is also proposed to aggregate the complementary information between
different inputs, which deduces the correlation between different features
along the channel and the spatial dimension sequentially. Besides, four metrics
are also proposed to evaluate object-level depth completion performance, which
can more intuitively reflect the quality of spacecraft depth completion
results. Finally, a large-scale satellite depth completion dataset is
constructed for training and testing spacecraft depth completion algorithms.
Empirical experiments on the dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed SDCNet, which achieves 0.25m mean absolute error of interest and
0.759m mean absolute truncation error, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a
large margin. The spacecraft pose estimation experiment is also conducted based
on the depth completion results, and the experimental results indicate that the
predicted dense depth map could meet the needs of downstream vision tasks.

Classically, the formation of such an S-shaped loop is envisaged to be

However, the details of reconnection are elusive due to weak emission and
subtle evolution during the pre-eruptive phase. In this paper, we investigate

slipping motions is heated; meanwhile, above the fixed footpoint coronal
emission dims due to a combination effect of the lengthening and heating of the
loop, the latter of which is manifested in the temporal variation of dimming
slope and of emission measure. These features together support an asymmetric
scenario of sigmoid formation through slipping reconnection of a single
J-shaped loop, which differs from the standard tether-cutting scenario
involving a double J-shaped loop system.

random transmission of genes from parents to offspring. However, this
inferential basis is typically only implicit or used as an informal
justification. As parent-offspring data becomes more widely available, we
advocate a different approach to MR that is exactly based on this natural
randomization, thereby formalizing the analogy between MR and randomized
controlled trials. We begin by developing a causal graphical model for MR which
represents several biological processes and phenomena, including population
structure, gamete formation, fertilization, genetic linkage, and pleiotropy.
This causal graph is then used to detect biases in population-based MR studies
and identify sufficient confounder adjustment sets to correct these biases. We
then propose a randomization test in the within-family MR design using the
exogenous randomness in meiosis and fertilization, which is extensively studied
in genetics. Besides its transparency and conceptual appeals, our approach also
offers some practical advantages, including robustness to misspecified
phenotype models, robustness to weak instruments, and elimination of bias
arising from population structure, assortative mating, dynastic effects, and
horizontal pleiotropy. We conclude with an analysis of a pair of negative and

properties of galaxies by decomposing their spectral energy distributions into
the main luminosity contributors (e.g. stellar populations or ionised gas).
However, the impact nebular emission has on the inferred properties of
star-forming (SF) galaxies has been largely overlooked over the years. The
objective of this work is to estimate the relations between stellar properties
of SF galaxies from SDSS DR7 by simultaneously fitting the stellar and nebular
continua with FADO and comparing them to the results derived using STARLIGHT, a
representative of purely stellar population synthesis codes. Differences
between codes regarding average mass, mean age and mean metallicity values can
go as high as $\sim$0.06 dex for the overall population of galaxies and
$\sim$0.12 dex for SF galaxies (galaxies with EW(H$\alpha$)>3 \AA), with the
most prominent difference between both codes in the light-weighted mean stellar
age. A closer look into the average light- and mass-weighted star formation
histories of intensively SF galaxies (EW(H$\alpha$)>75 \AA) suggests that
STARLIGHT is underestimating the average light-weighted age of intensively SF
galaxies by up to $\sim$0.17 dex and overestimating the light-weighted
metallicity by up to $\sim$0.13 dex compared to FADO (or vice versa). The
comparison between the average stellar properties of passive, SF and
intensively SF galaxy samples also reveals that differences between codes
increase with increasing EW(H$\alpha$) and decreasing total stellar mass. This
work finds indirect evidence that a purely stellar population synthesis
approach negatively impacts the inferred stellar properties of galaxies with
relatively high star formation rates. In turn, this can bias interpretations of
fundamental relations such as the mass-age or mass-metallicity.

because of the need to ensure safe and reliable artificial intelligence (AI).
The two dominantly used theories in machine ethics are deontological and
utilitarian ethics. Virtue ethics, on the other hand, has often been mentioned
as an alternative ethical theory. While this interesting approach has certain
advantages over popular ethical theories, little effort has been put into
engineering artificial virtuous agents due to challenges in their
formalization, codifiability, and the resolution of ethical dilemmas to train
virtuous agents. We propose to bridge this gap by using role-playing games
riddled with moral dilemmas. There are several such games in existence, such as
Papers, Please and Life is Strange, where the main character encounters
situations where they must choose the right course of action by giving up
something else dear to them. We draw inspiration from such games to show how a
systemic role-playing game can be designed to develop virtues within an
artificial agent. Using modern day AI techniques, such as affinity-based
reinforcement learning and explainable AI, we motivate the implementation of
virtuous agents that play such role-playing games, and the examination of their
decisions through a virtue ethical lens. The development of such agents and
environments is a first step towards practically formalizing and demonstrating
the value of virtue ethics in the development of ethical agents.

attentions in recent years. Nevertheless, just a few works have theoretically
analyzed the condition in which a certain opinion can spread in the whole
structured population. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game approach
for a binary opinion model to explore the conditions for an opinion's
spreading. Inspired by real-life observations, we assume that an agent's choice
to select an opinion is not random, but is based on a score rooted both from
public knowledge and the interactions with neighbors. By means of coalescing
random walks, we obtain a condition in which opinion $A$ can be favored to
spread on social networks in the weak selection limit. We find that the
successfully spreading condition of opinion $A$ is closely related to the basic
scores of binary opinions, the feedback scores on opinion interactions, and the
structural parameters including the edge weights, the weighted degrees of
vertices, and the average degree of the network. In particular, when
individuals adjust their opinions based solely on the public information, the
vitality of opinion $A$ depends exclusively on the difference of basic scores
of $A$ and $B$. When there are no negative (positive) feedback interactions
between connected individuals, we find that the success of opinion $A$ depends
on the ratio of the obtained positive (negative) feedback scores of competing
opinions. To complete our study, we perform computer simulations on
fully-connected, small-world, and scale-free networks, respectively, which
support and confirm our theoretical findings.

an interesting probe, complementary to the power spectrum of the full 21-cm
signal. Devising a flexible and reliable theoretical model for the bubble size
distribution paves the way for using it for astrophysical parameters inference.
The proposed model is built from the excursion set theory and a functional
relation between the bubble volume and the collapsed mass in the bubble. Unlike
previous models it accommodates any functional relation or distributions. Using
parameterized relations allows us to test the predictive power of the model by
performing a minimization best-fit to the bubble size distribution obtained
from a high resolution, fully coupled radiative hydrodynamics simulations,
HIRRAH-21. Our model is able to provide a better fit to the numerical bubble
size distribution at ionization fraction of $x_{\text{H}_{\text{II}}} \sim 1\%$

mass relation corresponding to the best-fit parameters, which is not an

confirming the possibility to infer this relation from an observed bubble size

  relation and interpretation based on action function","13 pages, 0 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The uncertainty principle is the most important for the foundations of
quantum mechanics but it still remains failed to reach a consensus of its
interpretation, which gives rise to debates upon its physical nature. In this
work, we address the problem of its foundation from a different aspect to
present an alternative formulation for proving the uncertainty relations in a
general way in terms of commutation relations and action function. The
relationship between the de Broglie relation and the uncertainty principle is
studied from a new angle. As a result, it is demonstrated that the de Broglie
relation is the foundation of the uncertainty principle. Starting with the
origin of the problem, we show that the de Broglie relation provides the form
of the wave function and the determined form of the wave function in turn leads
to the conception of operators for quantum mechanics, and thus it is possible
to provide with the help of the operators and wave function a generalized proof
of the uncertainty principle as the law governing ensemble of states. As a
decisive solution to the problem, the interpretation of the uncertainty
principle in terms of the action function is offered that gives one
self-consistent explanation in agreement with the known physical phenomena.
Eventually, we show the necessity and possibility of reassessing and improving
the foundation and interpretation of the uncertainty principle as a leading
principle of quantum mechanics.

Here, motivated by the interplay between topology and symmetry breaking, we

with opposite chiralities. We show that a self-consistent mean-field
description for the spinons exists that describes both the change of chirality
at the domain wall and the gapless edge modes living on it. A Ginzburg--Landau
theory for the domain wall is formulated based on the mean-field picture, from
which we obtain the non-universal properties of the domain wall such as the
wall width and tension. We show that the velocity of the topologically

Hamiltonian and ground state. Despite the significance of ground states

Hamiltonians. Quantum neural networks (QNNs), which exert the power of modern
quantum machines, have emerged as a leading protocol to conquer this issue. As
such, how to enhance the performance of QNNs becomes a crucial topic in GSP.
Empirical evidence showed that QNNs with handcraft symmetric ansatzes generally
experience better trainability than those with asymmetric ansatzes, while
theoretical explanations have not been explored. To fill this knowledge gap,
here we propose the effective quantum neural tangent kernel (EQNTK) and connect
this concept with over-parameterization theory to quantify the convergence of
QNNs towards the global optima. We uncover that the advance of symmetric
ansatzes attributes to their large EQNTK value with low effective dimension,
which requests few parameters and quantum circuit depth to reach the
over-parameterization regime permitting a benign loss landscape and fast
convergence. Guided by EQNTK, we further devise a symmetric pruning (SP) scheme
to automatically tailor a symmetric ansatz from an over-parameterized and
asymmetric one to greatly improve the performance of QNNs when the explicit
symmetry information of Hamiltonian is unavailable. Extensive numerical
simulations are conducted to validate the analytical results of EQNTK and the

attention owing to its fundamental importance in a wide spectrum of real-world
applications. Though a number of studies succeed in obtaining time-dependent
representations, it still faces significant challenges. On the one hand, most
of the existing methods restrict the embedding space with a certain curvature.
However, the underlying geometry in fact shifts among the positive curvature
hyperspherical, zero curvature Euclidean and negative curvature hyperbolic
spaces in the evolvement over time. On the other hand, these methods usually
require abundant labels to learn temporal representations, and thereby notably
limit their wide use in the unlabeled graphs of the real applications. To
bridge this gap, we make the first attempt to study the problem of
self-supervised temporal graph representation learning in the general
Riemannian space, supporting the time-varying curvature to shift among
hyperspherical, Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces. In this paper, we present a
novel self-supervised Riemannian graph neural network (SelfRGNN). Specifically,
we design a curvature-varying Riemannian GNN with a theoretically grounded time
encoding, and formulate a functional curvature over time to model the
evolvement shifting among the positive, zero and negative curvature spaces. To
enable the self-supervised learning, we propose a novel reweighting
self-contrastive approach, exploring the Riemannian space itself without
augmentation, and propose an edge-based self-supervised curvature learning with
the Ricci curvature. Extensive experiments show the superiority of SelfRGNN,
and moreover, the case study shows the time-varying curvature of temporal graph
in reality.

applications including wireless communication, live streaming, and cloud
computing. Yet, it poses a critical challenge since the scheduler needs to make
real-time decisions to guarantee the delay and resource constraints
simultaneously without prior information of system dynamics, which can be
time-varying and hard to estimate. Moreover, many practical scenarios suffer
from partial observability issues, e.g., due to sensing noise or hidden
correlation. To tackle these challenges, we propose a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) algorithm, named Recurrent Softmax Delayed Deep Double
Deterministic Policy Gradient ($\mathtt{RSD4}$), which is a data-driven method
based on a Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP) formulation.
$\mathtt{RSD4}$ guarantees resource and delay constraints by Lagrangian dual
and delay-sensitive queues, respectively. It also efficiently tackles partial
observability with a memory mechanism enabled by the recurrent neural network
(RNN) and introduces user-level decomposition and node-level merging to ensure
scalability. Extensive experiments on simulated/real-world datasets demonstrate
that $\mathtt{RSD4}$ is robust to system dynamics and partially observable
environments, and achieves superior performances over existing DRL and
non-DRL-based methods.

supercooled state. The phenomenological two-state models - based on the
assumption of the existence of two types of competing local states (or,
structures) in liquid water - have been extremely successful in describing
water's thermodynamic anomalies. However, the precise structural features of
these competing local states in liquid water still remain elusive. Here, we
have employed a geometrical order parameter-free approach to unambiguously
identify the two types of competing local states -- entropically and
energetically-favored -- with significantly different structural and energetic
features in the TIP4P/2005 liquid water. This identification is based on the
heterogeneous structural relaxation of the system in the potential energy
landscape (PEL) during the steepest-descent energy minimization. This
heterogeneous relaxation is characterized using order parameters inspired by
the spin-glass transition in frustrated magnetic systems. We have further
established a direct relationship between the population fluctuation of the two
states and the anomalous behavior of the heat capacity in supercooled water.
The composition-dependent spatial distribution of the entropically-favored
local states shows an interesting crossover from a spanning network-like single
cluster to the spatially delocalized clusters in the close vicinity of the
Widom line. Additionally, this study establishes a direct relationship between
the topographic features of the PEL and the water's thermodynamic anomalies in
the supercooled state and provides alternate markers (in addition to the locus
of maxima of thermodynamic response functions) for the Widom line in the phase
plane.

dominated by localised liquid-solid friction, entailing the existence of a
mobility relation between contact line speed and microscopic contact angle. We
present and discuss a set of non-equilibrium atomistic Molecular Dynamics
simulations of water nanodroplets spreading on or confined between silica-like

under wetting modes (`spontaneous' or `forced'). Upon changing the wettability
of the walls, it has been noticed that more hydrophilic substrates are easier
to wet rather than de-wet; we show how this asymmetry can be automatically
captured by a contact line friction model that accounts for the molecular
transport between liquid layers. A simple examination of the order and
orientation of near-contact-line water molecules corroborates the physical
foundation of the model. Lastly, we propose an approach to discriminate between
contact line friction models which overcomes the limitations of experimental
resolution. This work constitutes a stepping stone towards demystifying wetting
dynamics on high-friction hydrophilic substrates and underlines the relevance
of contact line friction in modelling the motion of three-phase contact lines.

standard or Schawlow-Townes limit [1]. Moreover, this was analytically proven
to be the ultimate quantum limit (Heisenberg limit) scaling under defining
conditions for CW lasers, plus a strong assumption about the properties of the
output beam. In Ref. [2], we show that the latter can be replaced by a weaker

changing the upper bound scaling or its achievability. In this Paper, we
provide details of the calculations in Ref. [2], and introduce three new

presented in that work. Each of these families of laser models is parameterized
by a real number, $p$, with $p=4$ corresponding to the original models. The
parameter space of these laser families is numerically investigated in detail,
where we explore the influence of these parameters on both the coherence and
photon statistics of the laser beams. Two distinct regimes for the coherence
may be identified based on the choice of $p$, where for $p>3$, each family of
models exhibits Heisenberg-limited beam coherence, while for $p<3$, the
Heisenberg limit is no longer attained. Moreover, in the former regime, we

account for $70-80\%$ of the galaxy population. Objects whose SFH was abruptly

that represents $\sim 5-10\%$ by (volume-corrected) number for $10^9 < M_*/{\rm

activity levels in terms of the birth rate parameter $b\equiv

three-dimensional (3D) contents, the visual quality of which may suffer from
noise and geometric shift distortions during the production procedure as well
as compression and downsampling distortions during the transmission process. To
tackle the challenge of point cloud quality assessment (PCQA), many PCQA
methods have been proposed to evaluate the visual quality levels of point
clouds by assessing the rendered static 2D projections. Although such
projection-based PCQA methods achieve competitive performance with the
assistance of mature image quality assessment (IQA) methods, they neglect that
the 3D model is also perceived in a dynamic viewing manner, where the viewpoint
is continually changed according to the feedback of the rendering device.
Therefore, in this paper, we treat the point clouds as moving camera videos and
explore the way of dealing with PCQA tasks via using video quality assessment
(VQA) methods. First, we generate the captured videos by rotating the camera
around the point clouds through several circular pathways. Then we extract both
spatial and temporal quality-aware features from the selected key frames and
the video clips through using trainable 2D-CNN and pre-trained 3D-CNN models
respectively. Finally, the visual quality of point clouds is represented by the
video quality values. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method
is effective for predicting the visual quality levels of the point clouds and
even competitive with full-reference (FR) PCQA methods. The ablation studies
further verify the rationality of the proposed framework and confirm the
contributions made by the quality-aware features extracted via the dynamic
viewing manner.

hydrodynamic, acoustic and heat release rate fluctuations lead to diverse
dynamics such as chaos, intermittency, and ordered dynamics. Such complex
interactions cause catastrophically high-amplitude acoustic pressure
oscillations and the emergence of order in the spatio-temporal dynamics,
referred to as thermoacoustic instability. In this work, we use multilayer
networks to study the topology of inter-subsystem interactions between the
hydrodynamic, acoustic and combustion subsystems in a bluff-body stabilized
turbulent dump combustor during diverse dynamical states. We construct a
two-layered network where the layers represent the thermoacoustic power and
vorticity fields. The inter-layer links are determined using cross-variable
short-window correlations between vorticity and thermoacoustic power
fluctuations. We distinguish the topology of inter-layer networks during
different dynamical states using network properties such as assortativity and
link-rank distributions. During chaotic dynamics, interactions between
subsystems are non-localized and spread throughout the flow field of the
combustor. During the state of thermoacoustic instability (order), the
inter-layer network topology reveals dense inter-layer connections between
regions of coherent thermoacoustic power generation and regions where large
vortices are shed periodically. Furthermore, we show that such dense
inter-layer connections emerge in localized pockets in the recirculation zone
in the dump plane of the combustor much prior to the onset of order, that is,
during the state of intermittency. We identify these regions of intense
inter-subsystem interactions as hubs of the multilayer network, and conjecture
that targeted attack at such hubs disrupts inter-subsystem interactions and
thus helps mitigate thermoacoustic instability.

super-model paradigm via domain adaptation, where one first trains a very
large-scale model, {\it i.e.}, super model (or foundation model in some other
papers), on a large amount of data and then adapts it to various specific
domains. Super-model paradigms help reduce computational and data cost and
carbon emission, which is critical to AI industry, especially enormous small
and medium-sized enterprises. We model the super-model paradigm as a two-stage
diffusion process: (1) in the pre-training stage, the model parameter diffuses
from random initials and converges to a steady distribution; and (2) in the
fine-tuning stage, the model parameter is transported to another steady
distribution. Both training stages can be mathematically modeled by the
Uhlenbeck-Ornstein process which converges to two Maxwell-Boltzmann
distributions, respectively, each of which characterizes the corresponding
convergent model. An $\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{N})$ generalization bound is then
established via PAC-Bayesian framework. The theory finds that the
generalization error of the fine-tuning stage is dominant in domain adaptation.
In addition, our theory suggests that the generalization is determined by a new
measure that characterizes the domain discrepancy between the source domain and
target domain, based on the covariance matrices and the shift of the converged
local minimum.

in a scalar condensate of non-interacting particles, however, it reappears in
the presence of an up-critical non-linearity. The nonlinear supercurrents are

We show that the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) induces the net superfluid

find solutions where the SOI-induced currents of two spin components of the
condensate propagate in opposite directions. The corresponding states of spinor

numerical simulations of turbulent forced convection are carried out by
introducing curvatures at sharp corners of a periodic grooved channel at the
lower wall. A heat source of constant magnitude is supplied in the bottom wall
while the upper wall is insulated. Computations were performed using

eNFW parameters which appears when the line-of-sight velocities alone are
available. {Our analysis demonstrates that, by estimating the log-slope of the
mass density profile estimated at the half-light radius, a sample of $N=2000$
stars can distinguish between a core and a cusp at more than $8\sigma$.} Proper
motions also return unbiased estimates of the dwarf mass profile with $1\sigma$
uncertainties that decrease, on average, from 2.65 dex to 0.15 dex when the
size of the star sample increases from $N=100$ to $N=6000$ stars. The measure
of the proper motions can thus strongly constrain the distribution of DM in
nearby dwarfs and provides a fundamental contribution to understanding the

topological complexity of input data and therefore improve the performance of
the model. Selecting a suitable activation function is an essential step in
neural model design. However, the choice of activation function is seldom
discussed or explored in Transformer-based language models. Their activation
functions are chosen beforehand and then remain fixed from pre-training to
fine-tuning. As a result, the inductive biases they imposed on models cannot be
adjusted during this long life cycle. Moreover, subsequently developed models
(e.g., RoBERTa, BART, and GPT-3) often follow up prior work (e.g., BERT) to use
the same activation function without justification. In this paper, we
investigate the effectiveness of using Rational Activation Function (RAF), a
learnable activation function, in the Transformer architecture. In contrast to
conventional, predefined activation functions, RAFs can adaptively learn
optimal activation functions during training according to input data. Our
experiments show the RAF-based Transformer (RAFT) achieves a lower validation
perplexity than a vanilla BERT with the GELU function. We further evaluate RAFT
on downstream tasks in low- and full-data settings. Our results show that RAFT
outperforms the counterpart model across the majority of tasks and settings.
For instance, RAFT outperforms vanilla BERT on the GLUE benchmark by 5.71
points on average in low-data scenario (where 100 training examples are
available) and by 2.05 points on SQuAD in full-data setting. Analysis of the
shapes of learned RAFs further unveils that they substantially vary between
different layers of the pre-trained model and mostly look very different from
conventional activation functions. RAFT opens a new research direction for
analyzing and interpreting pre-trained models according to the learned
activation functions.

adjustments. This process can be considered a manual analogy to tone mapping.
In this work, we draw inspiration from an expert photographer's approach and
present a Graph-based Semantic-aware Tone Mapping Operator, G-SemTMO. We
leverage semantic information as well as the contextual information of the
scene in the form of a graph capturing the spatial arrangements of its semantic

adjustments locally to different semantic segments in the image. In addition,

an expert photo-retoucher with local tonal enhancements. We conduct ablation

differentiating heavy rain from rain with thunderstorms. To address this issue,
we advocate leveraging an additional modality, sound, which has notable
advantages in image manipulation as it can convey more diverse semantic cues

this paper, we propose a novel approach that first extends the image-text joint
embedding space with sound and applies a direct latent optimization method to
manipulate a given image based on audio input, e.g., the sound of rain. Our

allowed us to study the spatially-resolved warm gas properties, including the
morphology of the ionised gas, EW(H$\alpha$) and kinematics as well as the
gas-phase metallicity (12 + log(O/H)) of these systems. In order to distinguish
between different ionisation mechanisms, we used the emission-line ratios [O
III]/H$\beta$ and [N II]/H$\alpha$ in the BPT diagrams and EW(H$\alpha$). We
find that the ionisation sources in our sample have variable impacts at
different radii, central regions are more influenced by low-luminosity AGN,
while extended regions of LINER-like emission are ionised by other mechanisms
with pAGBs photoionisation likely contributing significantly. We classified our
sample into three H$\alpha$+[N II] emission morphology types. We calculate the
gas-phase metallicity assuming several methods and ionisation sources. In
general, 12 + log(O/H) decreases with radius from the centre for all galaxies,
independently of nebular morphology type, indicating a metallicity gradient in
the abundance profiles. Interestingly, the more extended filamentary structures
and all extranuclear star-forming regions present shallow metallicity
gradients. Within the uncertainties these extended structures can be considered
chemically homogeneous. We suggest that group-dominant galaxies in our sample
likely acquired their cold gas in the past as a consequence of one or more
mechanisms, e.g. gas-clouds or satellite mergers/accretion and/or cooling flows
that contribute to the growth of the ionised gas structures.

set system $(V,\mathcal{F},\mathcal{B})$ with two families
$\mathcal{F},\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $V$. The task is to find a hitting set
for $\mathcal{F}$ that minimizes the maximum number of elements in any of the
sets of $\mathcal{B}$. Our focus is on determining the complexity of some
special cases of Sparse-HS with respect to the sparseness $k$, which is the
optimum number of hitting set elements in any set of $\mathcal{B}$.
  For the Sparse Vertex Cover (Sparse-VC) problem, $V$ is given by the vertex
set of a graph, and $\mathcal{F}$ is its edge set. We prove NP-hardness for
sparseness $k\geq 2$ and polynomial time solvability for $k=1$. We also provide
a polynomial-time $2$-approximation for any $k$. A special case of Sparse-VC is
Fair Vertex Cover (Fair-VC), where the family $\mathcal{B}$ is given by vertex
neighbourhoods. For this problem we prove NP-hardness for constant $k$ and
provide a polynomial-time $(2-\frac{1}{k})$-approximation. This is better than
any approximation possible for Sparse-VC or Vertex Cover (under UGC).
  We then consider two problems derived from Sparse-HS related to the highway
dimension, a graph parameter modelling transportation networks. Most algorithms
for graphs of low highway dimension compute solutions to the $r$-Shortest Path
Cover ($r$-SPC) problem, where $r>0$, $\mathcal{F}$ contains all shortest paths
of length between $r$ and $2r$, and $\mathcal{B}$ contains all balls of radius
$2r$. There is an XP algorithm that computes solutions to $r$-SPC of sparseness
at most $h$ if the input graph has highway dimension $h$, but the existence if
an FPT algorithm was open. We prove that $r$-SPC and also the related
$r$-Highway Dimension ($r$-HD) problem are both W[1]-hard. Furthermore, we
prove that $r$-SPC admits a polynomial-time $O(\log n)$-approximation.

on limited data suffers from a large variance and easily overfits. Inspired by
the classical perspective of the bias-variance tradeoff, we propose regularized
deep generative model (Reg-DGM), which leverages a nontransferable pre-trained
model to reduce the variance of generative modeling with limited data.
Formally, Reg-DGM optimizes a weighted sum of a certain divergence and the
expectation of an energy function, where the divergence is between the data and
the model distributions, and the energy function is defined by the pre-trained
model w.r.t. the model distribution. We analyze a simple yet representative
Gaussian-fitting case to demonstrate how the weighting hyperparameter trades
off the bias and the variance. Theoretically, we characterize the existence and
the uniqueness of the global minimum of Reg-DGM in a non-parametric setting and
prove its convergence with neural networks trained by gradient-based methods.
Empirically, with various pre-trained feature extractors and a data-dependent
energy function, Reg-DGM consistently improves the generation performance of
strong DGMs with limited data and achieves competitive results to the
state-of-the-art methods. Our implementation is available at

The analysis of synthetic line profiles shows that the gap in the H$\beta$ line
wing images maps the temperature minimum region between the photosphere and
chromosphere due to the well known opacity and emissivity gap of Balmer lines
in this layer. However, observed gap is detected farther from the line core in
the outer line wing positions than in the synthetic profiles. We found that an
increased microturbulence in the model chromosphere is needed to reproduce the
dark gap in the outer line wing, suggesting that observed H$\beta$ gap is the
manifestation of the temperature minimum and the dynamic nature of the solar
chromosphere. The temperature minimum produces a small enhancement in synthetic
Ca II line-wing intensities. Observed off-limb Ca II line-wing emissions show
similar enhancement below temperature minimum layer near the edge of the

high-stakes applications, policymakers have suggested tighter data protection

principle is the right to an actionable explanation, also known as algorithmic
recourse, allowing users to reverse unfavorable decisions. To date, it is
unknown whether these two principles can be operationalized simultaneously.
Therefore, we introduce and study the problem of recourse invalidation in the
context of data deletion requests. More specifically, we theoretically and
empirically analyze the behavior of popular state-of-the-art algorithms and
demonstrate that the recourses generated by these algorithms are likely to be
invalidated if a small number of data deletion requests (e.g., 1 or 2) warrant
updates of the predictive model. For the setting of linear models and
overparameterized neural networks -- studied through the lens of neural tangent
kernels (NTKs) -- we suggest a framework to identify a minimal subset of
critical training points which, when removed, maximize the fraction of
invalidated recourses. Using our framework, we empirically show that the
removal of as little as 2 data instances from the training set can invalidate
up to 95 percent of all recourses output by popular state-of-the-art
algorithms. Thus, our work raises fundamental questions about the compatibility

the double-degenerate model, or a massive, long-lasting merger remnant.
Expected multi-messenger signals of these events will help us to distinguish
detailed merging physical processes. In this work, we aim to provide a generic

the merging evolution of a DWD system, different messengers (GW, neutrino and

that DWD merger events located at the distance of 1 kpc can indeed produce
detectable signals of GWs and neutrinos. The GW frequency are in 0.3-0.6 Hz

evolution code, LPCODE. For this work, the standard equations of stellar
structure and evolution have been modified to include the full effects of
general relativity. For comparison purposes, the same sequences have been
computed but for the Newtonian case. According to our calculations, the
evolutionary properties of the most massive white dwarfs are strongly modified
by general relativity effects. In particular, the resulting stellar radius is
markedly smaller in the general relativistic case, being up to 25% smaller than
predicted by the Newtonian treatment for the more massive ones. We find that
oxygen/neon white dwarfs more massive than 1.369 Msun become gravitationally
unstable with respect to general relativity effects. When core chemical
distribution due to phase separation on crystallization is considered, such
instability occurs at somewhat lower stellar masses, greater than 1.36 Msun. In
addition, cooling times for the most massive white dwarf sequences result in
about a factor of two smaller than in the Newtonian case at advanced stages of
evolution. Finally, a sample of white dwarfs has been identified as ideal
candidates to test these general relativistic effects. We conclude that the
general relativity effects should be taken into account for an accurate

during the shift of air mass upwards from equilibrium or heat when shifting

Therefore the displacement of measured (essentially instantaneous) temperature

vertical displacement of the radiosonde from the polynomial curve. The

splitting the time series (q_i, p_i) into several partitions, and then train a
leap-frog neural network (LFNN) to approximate the generating function between
the first (i.e. initial condition) and one of the rest partitions. For
predicting the system evolution in a short timescale, the LFNN could
effectively avoid the issue of accumulative error. Then the LFNN is applied to
learn the behavior of the 2:3 resonant Kuiper belt objects, in a much longer
time period, and there are two significant improvements on the neural network
constructed in our previous work (Li et al. 2022): (1) conservation of the
Jacobi integral ; (2) highly accurate prediction of the orbital evolution. We
propose that the LFNN may be useful to make the prediction of the long time
evolution of the Hamiltonian system.

higher-level causal representations that affect lower-level observations.
Identifying true latent causal representations from observed data, while
allowing instantaneous causal relations among latent variables, remains a
challenge, however. To this end, we start from the analysis of three intrinsic
properties in identifying latent space from observations: transitivity,
permutation indeterminacy, and scaling indeterminacy. We find that transitivity
acts as a key role in impeding the identifiability of latent causal
representations. To address the unidentifiable issue due to transitivity, we
introduce a novel identifiability condition where the underlying latent causal
model satisfies a linear-Gaussian model, in which the causal coefficients and
the distribution of Gaussian noise are modulated by an additional observed
variable. Under some mild assumptions, we can show that the latent causal
representations can be identified up to trivial permutation and scaling.
Furthermore, based on this theoretical result, we propose a novel method,
termed Structural caUsAl Variational autoEncoder, which directly learns latent
causal representations and causal relationships among them, together with the
mapping from the latent causal variables to the observed ones. We show that the
proposed method learns the true parameters asymptotically. Experimental results
on synthetic and real data demonstrate the identifiability and consistency
results and the efficacy of the proposed method in learning latent causal

spin-to-charge conversion (SCC), relying on mapping the spin states onto the
neutral (NV$^0$) and negative (NV$^-$) charge states, followed by a subsequent
charge readout. With high charge-state stability, SCC enables extended
measurement times, increasing precision and minimizing noise in the readout
compared to the commonly used fluorescence detection. Nano-scale sensing
applications, however, require shallow NV centers within a few nm distance from
the surface, where surface-related effects might degrade the NV charge state.
In this article, we investigate the charge state initialization and stability
of single NV centers implanted ~ 5nm below the surface of a flat diamond plate.
We demonstrate the SCC protocol on four shallow NV centers suitable for
nano-scale sensing, obtaining a reduced readout noise of 5--6 times the
spin-projection noise limit. We investigate the general applicability of SCC
for shallow NV centers and observe a correlation between NV charge-state
stability and readout noise. Coating the diamond with glycerol improves both
charge initialization and stability. Our results reveal the influence of the

information about joint gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM)

The possibility for non-experts to execute quick computations of joint GW-sGRB
detections should be facilitated. We construct a sGRB model and add this to the
framework of the previously-built Gravitational Wave Universe Toolbox. We
provide expected joint GW-sGRB detection rates for different combinations of GW
detectors and high-energy (HE) instruments. We employ and adapt a generic GRB
model to create a top-hat jet model suitable for the Toolbox. We simulate a
population of binary neutron stars (BNSs) observed by a user-specified GW
detector. Our model predicts the properties of a resulting sGRB, as well as its
detectability. We report predicted joint detection rates for combinations of GW
detectors with HE instruments. Our findings stress the significance of the
impact of the Einstein Telescope (ET); ET will observe BNSs at such a rate that
the vast majority of detected sGRBs will have an observed GW counterpart.
Additionally, given the limited LIGO horizon, a search for sub-threshold GW
signals at higher redshifts using sGRB information from HE detectors has the
potential to be very successful. Equivalently, during the ET era, GW data can
assist in finding sub-threshold sGRBs, potentially increasing e.g. the number
of joint ET-Fermi/GBM observations by $\sim$270%. Lastly, we find that our
top-hat jet model underestimates the number of joint detections that include an
off-axis sGRB. We correct for this with a second, wider and weaker jet
component. We find that the majority of joint detections during the current era
will include an off-axis sGRB, making GRB170817A not as unlikely as one would
think. In the ET era, most joint detections will contain an on-axis sGRB.

the antenna termination resistor of the bolometer is directly biased with DC or

extracted multi-scale features can not adaptively utilize the appropriate scale
information according to the geometric information around noisy points. It
leads to surface degradation, especially for points close to edges and points

domain data, under the setting that data from multiple source domains are
labelled and data from the target domain are unlabelled. Most methods for this
task focus on learning invariant representations across domains. However, their
success relies heavily on the assumption that the label distribution remains
consistent across domains, which may not hold in general real-world problems.
In this paper, we propose a new and more flexible assumption, termed
\textit{latent covariate shift}, where a latent content variable $\mathbf{z}_c$
and a latent style variable $\mathbf{z}_s$ are introduced in the generative
process, with the marginal distribution of $\mathbf{z}_c$ changing across
domains and the conditional distribution of the label given $\mathbf{z}_c$
remaining invariant across domains. We show that although (completely)
identifying the proposed latent causal model is challenging, the latent content
variable can be identified up to scaling by using its dependence with labels
from source domains, together with the identifiability conditions of nonlinear
ICA. This motivates us to propose a novel method for MSDA, which learns the
invariant label distribution conditional on the latent content variable,
instead of learning invariant representations. Empirical evaluation on

approach for sparse GLARMA models, which are pervasive for modeling
discrete-valued time series. Our approach consists in iteratively combining the
estimation of the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) coefficients of GLARMA
models with regularized methods designed for performing variable selection in
regression coefficients of Generalized Linear Models (GLM). We first establish
the consistency of the ARMA part coefficient estimators in a specific case.
Then, we explain how to efficiently implement our approach. Finally, we assess
the performance of our methodology using synthetic data, compare it with
alternative methods and illustrate it on an example of real-world application.
Our approach, which is implemented in the GlarmaVarSel R package and available
on the CRAN, is very attractive since it benefits from a low computational load
and is able to outperform the other methods in terms of coefficient estimation,
particularly in recovering the non null regression coefficients.

a simple description that captures the essential aspects of the dynamics of a

examined and several characteristic times are identified. One of them
generalizes the tunneling time-scale introduced by B\""uttiker and Landauer and

the natural frequencies in systems of $N$ globally coupled Kuramoto
oscillators, the dynamics of the order parameter, in the limit $N\to \infty$,
evolves, under suitable initial conditions, in a manifold of low dimension.
This is not possible when the frequency distribution, continued in the complex
plane, has an essential singularity at infinite; this is the case for example,
of a Gaussian distribution. In this work we propose a simple approximation
scheme that allows to extend also to this case the representation of the
dynamics of the order parameter in a low dimensional manifold. Using as a
working example the Gaussian frequency distribution, we compare the dynamical
evolution of the order parameter of the system of oscillators, obtained by the
numerical integration of the $N$ equations of motion, with the analogous
dynamics in the low dimensional manifold obtained with the application of the
approximation scheme. The results confirm the validity of the approximation.
The method could be employed for general frequency distributions, allowing the
determination of the corresponding phase diagram of the oscillator system.

sensitive decision-making processes (e.g., determining job candidates,
assigning credit scores), they are rife with concerns over unintended biases in
their outcomes, which makes algorithmic fairness (e.g., demographic parity,
equal opportunity) an objective of interest. 'Algorithmic recourse' offers
feasible recovery actions to change unwanted outcomes through the modification
of attributes. We introduce the notion of ranked group-level recourse fairness,
and develop a 'recourse-aware ranking' solution that satisfies ranked recourse
fairness constraints while minimizing the cost of suggested modifications. Our
solution suggests interventions that can reorder the ranked list of database
records and mitigate group-level unfairness; specifically, disproportionate
representation of sub-groups and recourse cost imbalance. This re-ranking
identifies the minimum modifications to data points, with these attribute
modifications weighted according to their ease of recourse. We then present an
efficient block-based extension that enables re-ranking at any granularity
(e.g., multiple brackets of bank loan interest rates, multiple pages of search
engine results). Evaluation on real datasets shows that, while existing methods
may even exacerbate recourse unfairness, our solution -- RAGUEL --
significantly improves recourse-aware fairness. RAGUEL outperforms alternatives
at improving recourse fairness, through a combined process of counterfactual
generation and re-ranking, whilst remaining efficient for large-scale datasets.

frequency range $\approx$(0.1--10) GHz. As the result the thermal WIMP lighter

$W^+W^-,Z^0Z^0,t\overline{t},hh$; can not be probed at the level of thermal

obtained exclusions are competitive to those from Fermi-LAT observations of

restrict the opportunity to explain the gamma-ray outer halo of M31 by

improves the mean target tracking accuracy by $27\%$, and the mean tracking
error is $23$ cm in the most challenging case of $3$ moving targets. Finally,
ORACLE does not show significant performance reduction when the fusion rate is
reduced to up to 1/5 of the frame rate of the single radar sensors, thus being
amenable to a lightweight implementation on a resource-constrained fusion
center.

parameter-dependent saturation model (bSat or IP-Sat) to the leading neutron
structure function HERA data in one pion exchange approximation. Both
parametrizations of the dipole cross section provide good descriptions of the
considered data. It is shown here for the first time that the experimental
leading neutron production HERA data exhibits geometric scaling, which in this
context means that the total $\gamma^* \pi^*$ cross section is a function of
only one dimensionless variable $\tau = Q^2/Q_s^2(x)$. The geometric scaling
region extends over a broad range of $Q^2$ and can be attributed to the
presence of a saturation boundary which manifests at $Q^2\geq Q^2_s$. The
scaling behaviour in leading neutron events is profoundly similar to what has
been observed for the inclusive DIS events.

task for a diversity of applications. To capture context at both global and

matcher that is built on hierarchical attention structure, adopting a novel
attention operation which is capable of adjusting attention span in a
self-adaptive manner. To achieve this goal, first, flow maps are regressed in
each cross attention phase to locate the center of search region. Next, a
sampling grid is generated around the center, whose size, instead of being
empirically configured as fixed, is adaptively computed from a pixel
uncertainty estimated along with the flow map. Finally, attention is computed
across two images within derived regions, referred to as attention span. By
these means, we are able to not only maintain long-range dependencies, but also
enable fine-grained attention among pixels of high relevance that compensates
essential locality and piece-wise smoothness in matching tasks.
State-of-the-art accuracy on a wide range of evaluation benchmarks validates
the strong matching capability of our method.

calculate the dynamics of weakly interacting multi-pulse solutions of the

scheme is based on a global centre-manifold reduction where one considers the
solution of the QCGLE as the composition of individual pulses plus a remainder
function, which is orthogonal to the adjoint eigenfunctions of the linearised
operator about a single pulse. This centre-manifold projection overcomes the
difficulties of other, more orthodox, numerical schemes, by yielding a
fast-slow system describing 'slow' ordinary differential equations for the
locations and phases of the individual pulses, and a 'fast' partial
differential equation for the remainder function. With small parameter
$\epsilon=e^{-\lambda_r d}$ where $\lambda_r$ is a constant and $d>0$ is the
pulse separation distance, we write the fast-slow system in terms of
first-order and second-order correction terms only, a formulation which is
solved more efficiently than the full system. This fast-slow system is
integrated numerically using adaptive time-stepping. Results are presented here
for two- and three-pulse interactions. For the two-pulse problem, cells of
periodic behaviour, separated by an infinite set of heteroclinic orbits, are
shown to 'split' under perturbation creating complex spiral behaviour. For the
case of three pulse interaction a range of dynamics, including chaotic pulse
interaction, are found. While results are presented for pulse interaction in
the QCGLE, the numerical scheme can also be applied to a wider class of

Still, they have several disadvantages: limited interpretability, need for

and poor performance from symmetric similarities in directed link prediction.
We propose MapSim, an information-theoretic measure to assess node similarities

MapSim represents nodes in a discrete, non-metric space of communities and
yields asymmetric similarities in an unsupervised fashion. We compare MapSim on

system needs the following abilities to face the challenge: preserving vital
semantics, being expansible, and free from expert knowledge. In this work, we
present AVMiner, an expansible malware tagging system that can mine the most
vital tokens from AV labels. AVMiner adopts natural language processing
techniques and clustering methods to generate a sequence of tokens without
expert knowledge ranked by importance. AVMiner can self-update when new samples
come. Finally, we evaluate AVMiner on over 8,000 samples from well-known
datasets with manually labeled ground truth, which outperforms previous works.

section is calculated in the equivalent photon approximation (EPA). The total
UPCs cross section is related to the matrix elements of $\gamma \gamma\to \pi^0
G_2$ process, which can be described as in terms of neutral pion and tensor
glueball $G_2$'s distribution amplitudes. The predictions for the rapidity
distributions of UPCs cross sections and total cross sections are presented.
The theoretical uncertainty of the whole calculation is considered. We consider
the decay modes of the final-state tensor glueball and estimate the
corresponding number of events. We estimate that there are about 10 tensor
glueball $G_2\to\phi\phi$ signal events in $PbPb$ collisions at the LHC. We
also argue that the lead-lead UPC experiments at future HE-LHC and FCC
experiments will provide larger opportunities to measure tensor glueballs.

EasyScale dynamically assigns workers based on our intra-job and inter-job

labeling that allows to efficiently check that the property is satisfied, or
that the structure is correct. The quality of a certification is measured by
the size of its labels: the smaller, the better.This notion plays a central
role in self-stabilization, because the size of the certification is a lower
bound (and often an upper bound) on the memory needed for silent
self-stabilizing construction of distributed data structures. From the point of
view of distributed computing in general, it is also a measure of the locality
of a property (e.g. properties of the network itself, such as planarity).
  When it comes to the size of the certification labels, one can identify three
important regimes: the properties for which the optimal size is polynomial in
the number of vertices of the graph, the ones that require only polylogarithmic
size, and the ones that can be certified with a constant number of bits. The
first two regimes are well studied, with several upper and lower bounds,
specific techniques, and active research questions. On the other hand, the
constant regime has never been really explored, at least on the lower bound
side. The main contribution of this paper is the first non-trivial lower bound
for this low regime. More precisely, we show that by using certification on
just one bit (a binary certification), one cannot certify $k$-colorability for
$k\geq 3$. To do so, we develop a new technique, based on the notion of score,
and both local symmetry arguments and a global parity argument. We hope that
this technique will be useful for establishing stronger results. We complement
this result by a discussion of the implication of lower bounds for this
constant-size regime, and with an upper bound for a related problem,
illustrating that in some cases one can do better than the natural upper bound.

these variables are well studied at the scale of a single and relatively small
dune, the average effect of a periodic large-scale dune pattern on atmospheric
flows remains poorly constrained, due to a pressing lack of data in major sand
seas. Here, we compare local measurements of surface winds to the predictions
of the ERA5-Land climate reanalysis at four locations in Namibia, both within
and outside the giant linear dune field of the Namib Sand Sea. In the desert
plains to the north of the sand sea, observations and predictions agree well.
This is also the case in the interdune areas of the sand sea during the day.
During the night, however, an additional wind component aligned with the giant
dune orientation is measured, in contrast to the easterly wind predicted by the
ERA5-Land reanalysis. For the given dune orientation and measured wind regime,
we link the observed wind deviation (over 50\textdegree) to the daily cycle of
the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer. During the night, a shallow boundary
layer induces a flow confinement above the giant dunes, resulting in large flow
deviations, especially for the slower easterly winds. During the day, the
feedback of the giant dunes on the atmospheric flow is much weaker due to the
thicker boundary layer and higher wind speeds. Finally, we propose that the
confinement mechanism and the associated wind deflections induced by giant
dunes could explain the development of smaller-scale secondary dunes, which
elongate obliquely in the interdune areas of the primary dune pattern.

to any auto-regressive neural network model. We evaluate our proposed
architecture on the challenging M4 dataset, achieving competitive performance
compared to ensemble based methods. We also compare against existing recently
proposed Transformer models for time series forecasting, showing superior
performance on the M4 dataset. Extensive ablation studies show that Persistence
Initialization leads to better performance and faster convergence. As the size
of the model increases, only the models with our proposed adaptation gain in
performance. We also perform an additional ablation study to determine the
importance of the choice of normalization and positional encoding, and find
both the use of Rotary encodings and ReZero normalization to be essential for
good forecasting performance.

for day-time scene parsing. They rely on modeling pixel intensity-based spatial
contextual cues under even illumination. Hence, these methods do not perform
well in night-time scenes as such spatial contextual cues are buried in the
over-/under-exposed regions in night-time scenes. In this paper, we first
conduct an image frequency-based statistical experiment to interpret the
day-time and night-time scene discrepancies. We find that image frequency
distributions differ significantly between day-time and night-time scenes, and
understanding such frequency distributions is critical to NTSP problem. Based
on this, we propose to exploit the image frequency distributions for night-time
scene parsing. First, we propose a Learnable Frequency Encoder (LFE) to model
the relationship between different frequency coefficients to measure all
frequency components dynamically. Second, we propose a Spatial Frequency Fusion

unaltered the acoustic ones. The effect is also visible in the higher and more
numerous van Hove singularities of the phonon density of states. We also point
out that the behavior of the thermal conductance with the twisted angle is

twisted and non-twisted layers. The finite-size effect is demonstrated to play
an essential role in defining the critical angles at the local minimums, where

as The Lord of the Rings? Among other things, such a model must be able to: (a)
identify and record new characters (entities) and their attributes as they are
introduced in the text, and (b) identify subsequent references to the
characters previously introduced and update their attributes. This problem of
entity tracking is essential for language understanding, and thus, useful for a
wide array of downstream applications in NLP such as question-answering,
summarization.
  In this thesis, we focus on two key problems in relation to facilitating the
use of entity tracking models: (i) scaling entity tracking models to long
documents, such as a novel, and (ii) integrating entity tracking into language
models. Applying language technologies to long documents has garnered interest
recently, but computational constraints are a significant bottleneck in scaling
up current methods. In this thesis, we argue that computationally efficient
entity tracking models can be developed by representing entities with rich,
fixed-dimensional vector representations derived from pretrained language
models, and by exploiting the ephemeral nature of entities. We also argue for
the integration of entity tracking into language models as it will allow for:
(i) wider application given the current ubiquitous use of pretrained language
models in NLP applications, and (ii) easier adoption since it is much easier to
swap in a new pretrained language model than to integrate a separate standalone
entity tracking model.

applicable to a time-resolved measurement paradigm can greatly reduce noise,
but these methods apply pixel by pixel without exploiting image structure. Raw
SE count data can be modeled with a compound Poisson (Neyman Type A)
likelihood, which implies data variance that is signal-dependent and greater
than the variation in the underlying particle-sample interaction. These
statistical properties make methods that assume additive white Gaussian noise
ineffective. This paper introduces methods for particle beam micrograph
denoising that use the plug-and-play framework to exploit image structure while
being applicable to the unusual data likelihoods of this modality.
Approximations of the data likelihood that vary in accuracy and computational
complexity are combined with denoising by total variation regularization, BM3D,
and DnCNN. Methods are provided for both conventional and time-resolved
measurements, assuming SE counts are available. In simulations representative
of helium ion microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, significant
improvements in root mean-squared error (RMSE), structural similarity index

low-complexity iterative detection. We aim to minimize the total transmit power
by jointly designing the precoder of the transmitter and the passive

information theory. But this information-theoretic approach may involve
prohibitively high complexity since the number of rate constraints that specify
the capacity region of the uplink multiuser channel is exponential in the
number of users. To avoid this difficulty, we formulate the design problem of
the iterative receiver under the constraints of a maximal iteration number and
target bit error rates of users. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose
a groupwise successive interference cancellation (SIC) optimization approach,
where the signals of users are decoded and cancelled in a group-by-group
manner. We present a heuristic user grouping strategy, and resort to the
alternating optimization technique to iteratively solve the precoding and
passive beamforming sub-problems. Specifically, for the precoding sub-problem,
we employ fractional programming to convert it to a convex problem; for the
passive beamforming sub-problem, we adopt successive convex approximation to
deal with the unit-modulus constraints of the RIS. We show that the proposed
groupwise SIC approach has significant advantages in both performance and
computational complexity, as compared with the counterpart approaches.

embedding symbolic shapes (e.g., circular routes) in order to guide readers'
attention (e.g., Moscow map and Japan railway map). However, manually producing
such maps is labor-intensive and the effect of shapes remains unclear. In this
paper, we propose an approach to generalize such mixed metro maps that take
user-defined shapes as an input. In this mixed design, lines that are used to
approximate the shapes are arranged symbolically, while the remaining lines
follow classical layout convention. A three-step algorithm, including (1)
detecting and selecting routes for shape approximation, (2) shape and layout
deformation, and (3) aligning lines on a grid, is integrated to guarantee good

resolved systematically using the optimization paradigm. Finally, we evaluate
the performance of our approach and perform a user study to test if the

To ensure data security, AuthROS employs the smart contract for permission

sunspots during sunspot decay and compared it with the flow field of
supergranular cells. The decay of a sunspot proceeds as it interacts with its
surroundings. This is manifested by the changes observed in the flow field
surrounding the decaying spot. We now investigate in detail the evolution of
the flow field in the direct periphery of the sunspots of the same sample and
aim to provide a complete picture of the role of large-scale flows present in
sunspot cells. We analyse the horizontal velocity profiles of sunspots obtained
from observations by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We follow their evolution across the solar
disc from their stable phase to their decay and their final disappearance. We
find two different scenarios for the evolution of the flow region surrounding a
spot in the final stage of its decay: (i) either the flow cell implodes and
disappears under the action of the surrounding supergranules or (ii) it
outlives the spot. In the later case, an inwards flow towards the remaining
naked spot develops in the vicinity closest to the spot followed by an outflow
further out. These findings provide observational evidence to theoretical
predictions by realistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) sunspot and moat region
simulations. The Evershed flow and the moat flow, both connected to the
presence of fully fledged sunspots in a spot cell, vanish when penumbrae decay.
Moat flows decline into supergranular flows. The final fate of a spot cell
depends on its interaction with the surrounding supergranular cells. In the
case of non-imploding spot cells, the remaining naked spot develops a
converging inflow driven by radiative cooling and a geometrical alignment of
granules in its periphery which is similar to that observed in pores.

free-free emission on intermediate angular scales, which is mitigated through
model reduction, masking, and resampling. We compare our posterior-based CMB
results with previous Planck products, and find generally good agreement, but
with higher noise due to exclusion of HFI data. We find a best-fit CMB dipole
amplitude of $3362.7\pm1.4{\mu}K$, in excellent agreement with previous Planck
results. The quoted uncertainty is derived directly from the sampled posterior
distribution, and does not involve any ad hoc contribution for systematic
effects. Similarly, we find a temperature quadrupole amplitude of
$\sigma^{TT}_2=229\pm97{\mu}K^2$, in good agreement with previous results in
terms of the amplitude, but the uncertainty is an order of magnitude larger
than the diagonal Fisher uncertainty. Relatedly, we find lower evidence for a
possible alignment between $\ell = 2$ and $\ell = 3$ than previously reported
due to a much larger scatter in the individual quadrupole coefficients, caused
both by marginalizing over a more complete set of systematic effects, and by
our more conservative analysis mask. For higher multipoles, we find that the
angular temperature power spectrum is generally in good agreement with both
Planck and WMAP. This is the first time the sample-based asymptotically exact
Blackwell-Rao estimator has been successfully established for multipoles up to
$\ell\le600$, and it now accounts for the majority of the cosmologically

architectures have been proposed to ensure safety of CPS under such faults and
attacks via methodologies including redundancy and restarting from safe
operating conditions. The existing resilient architectures for CPS utilize
different mechanisms to guarantee safety, and currently there is no approach to
compare them. Moreover, the analysis and design undertaken for CPS employing
one architecture is not readily extendable to another. In this paper, we
propose a timing-based framework for CPS employing various resilient

the cyber subsystem operates in one out of a finite number of statuses, we
first develop a hybrid system model that captures CPS adopting any of these

satisfy a given safety constraint and derive sufficient conditions for the
solution. Utilizing the derived conditions, we provide an algorithm to compute

line of work brings algorithmic benefits, it also introduces significant
hardware overheads due to variable-length encoding and decoding.
  In this work, we propose a fixed-length adaptive numerical data type called
ANT to achieve low-bit quantization with tiny hardware overheads. Our data type
ANT leverages two key innovations to exploit the intra-tensor and inter-tensor

grasping, and recent deep learning based approaches have achieved remarkable
results on benchmarks. However, their generalization capabilities in real-world
applications remain unclear. To overcome this gap, we introduce 6IMPOSE, a
novel framework for sim-to-real data generation and 6D pose estimation. 6IMPOSE
consists of four modules: First, a data generation pipeline that employs the 3D
software suite Blender to create synthetic RGBD image datasets with 6D pose
annotations. Second, an annotated RGBD dataset of five household objects
generated using the proposed pipeline. Third, a real-time two-stage 6D pose
estimation approach that integrates the object detector YOLO-V4 and a
streamlined, real-time version of the 6D pose estimation algorithm PVN3D
optimized for time-sensitive robotics applications. Fourth, a codebase designed
to facilitate the integration of the vision system into a robotic grasping
experiment. Our approach demonstrates the efficient generation of large amounts
of photo-realistic RGBD images and the successful transfer of the trained
inference model to robotic grasping experiments, achieving an overall success
rate of 87% in grasping five different household objects from cluttered
backgrounds under varying lighting conditions. This is made possible by the
fine-tuning of data generation and domain randomization techniques, and the
optimization of the inference pipeline, overcoming the generalization and
performance shortcomings of the original PVN3D algorithm. Finally, we make the
code, synthetic dataset, and all the pretrained models available on Github.

agreement. The most important quality improvement is due to significantly lower
calibration uncertainties in the new processing, as we find a fractional
absolute calibration uncertainty at 70 GHz of $\delta g_{0}/g_{0} =5 \cdot
10^{-5}$, which is nominally 40 times smaller than that reported by Planck
2018. However, the original Planck 2018 estimate has a non-trivial statistical
interpretation, and this further illustrates the advantage of the new framework
in terms of producing self-consistent and well-defined error estimates of all
involved quantities without the need of ad hoc uncertainty contributions. We
describe how low-resolution data products, including dense pixel-pixel
covariance matrices, may be produced directly from the posterior samples
without the need for computationally expensive analytic calculations or

unique capabilities in terms of low-level systematics modelling and error

optical pumping. Molecular structure that most obviously facilitates cycling
involves a strong electronic transition, with favorable vibrational branching
(diagonal Franck-Condon factors, aka FCFs) and without any intervening
electronic states. Here, we propose important adjustments to those criteria,
based on our experience optically pumping SiO$^+$. Specifically, the preference
for no intervening electronic states should be revised, and over-reliance on
FCFs can miss important features. The intervening electronic state in SiO$^+$is
actually found to be beneficial in ground rotational state preparation, by
providing a pathway for population to undergo a parity flip. This contribution
demonstrates the possibility that decay through intervening states may help
state preparation of non-diagonal or polyatomic molecules. We also expand upon
the definition of favorable branching. In SiO$^+$, we find that the
off-diagonal FCFs fail to reflect the vibrational heating versus cooling rates.
Since the branching rates are determined by transition dipole moments (TDMs) we
introduce a simple model to approximate the TDMs for off-diagonal decays. We
find that two terms, set primarily by the slope of the dipole moment function
($d\mu/dx$) and offset in equilibrium bond lengths ($\Delta x = r_e^g-r_e^e$),
can add (subtract) to increase (decrease) the magnitude of a given TDM.
Applying the model to SiO$^+$, we find there is a fortuitous cancellation,
where decay leading to vibrational excitation is reduced, causing optical
cycling to lead naturally to vibrational cooling.

of the global symmetry groups: the orthogonal group for the $O(n)$ model, and
the symmetric group $S_Q$ for the $Q$-state Potts model.
  We do this by two independent methods. First we compute the twisted torus

employ neural networks to fully predict the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor
of turbulent channel flows at different friction Reynolds numbers, for both
interpolation and extrapolation scenarios. Several generic neural networks of
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) type are trained with different input feature
combinations to acquire a complete grasp of the role of each parameter. The
best performance is yielded by the model with the dimensionless mean streamwise
velocity gradient $\alpha$, the dimensionless wall distance $y^+$ and the
friction Reynolds number $\mathrm{Re}_\tau$ as inputs. A deeper theoretical
insight into the Tensor Basis Neural Network (TBNN) clarifies some remaining
ambiguities found in the literature concerning its application of Pope's
general eddy viscosity model. We emphasize the sensitivity of the TBNN on the
constant tensor $\textbf{T}^{*(0)}$ upon the turbulent channel flow data set,
and newly propose a generalized $\textbf{T}^{*(0)}$, which considerably
enhances its performance. Through comparison between the MLP and the augmented
TBNN model with both $\{\alpha, y^+, \mathrm{Re}_\tau\}$ as input set, it is
concluded that the former outperforms the latter and provides excellent
interpolation and extrapolation predictions of the Reynolds stress anisotropy

  models","73 pages, 6 figures, minor changes",,,,"gr-qc astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modified gravity models often contain modes that couple to normal matter and
propagate with slightly less than the speed of light. High-energy cosmic rays
then lose energy due to Cherenkov radiation, which constrains such models. This
is also true for some MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) models. However, these
constraints are difficult to make precise because MOND is inherently non-linear
and because the results may depend on the specific high-acceleration behavior
of these models, i.e. the behavior outside the MOND regime. Recently, various
hybrid MOND dark matter models were proposed, where cold dark matter (CDM)
phenomenology on cosmological scales and MOND phenomenology on galactic scales
share a common origin. Such models typically contain a mode that is directly
coupled to matter (for MOND), but with non-relativistic sound speed (for CDM).
Thus, even non-relativistic objects like stars can emit gravitational Cherenkov
radiation. We calculate a lower bound on the associated energy loss. We use a
controlled approximation that depends only on the MOND regime of these models.
We apply our results to three concrete models: For the original superfluid dark
matter model (SFDM), we rule out a part of the parameter space, including the
most commonly used parameters. For two-field SFDM, we find no constraint since
the matter coupling of the relevant mode is suppressed by mixing. For the
recently-proposed model by Skordis and Z{\l}o\'snik, we find no constraint
since the matter coupling is suppressed in non-static situations.

$t$-admissibility problem aims to decide whether the tree stretch index is at

$t$-admissible is the stretch index of $G$, denoted by $\sigma_T(G)$. Given a
graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, the recognition of $2$-admissible graphs
can be done $O(n+m)$ time, whereas $t$-admissibility is NP-complete for
$\sigma_T(G) \leq t$, $t \geq 4$ and deciding if $t = 3$ is an open problem,

atmospheres of many T and Y-dwarfs has been inferred due to enhanced mixing
ratios of CO and reduced NH$_3$. Atmospheric models of planets and brown dwarfs
typically parameterize this vertical mixing phenomenon with the vertical eddy
diffusion coefficient, $K_{\rm zz}$. While $K_{\rm zz}$ can perhaps be
approximated in the convective regions in the atmosphere with mixing length
theory, in radiative regions the strength of vertical mixing is uncertain by
many orders of magnitude. With a new grid of self-consistent 1D model
atmospheres from $T_{\rm eff}$ of 400 - 1000 K, computed with a new
radiative-convective equilibrium python code PICASO 3.0, we aim to assess how
molecular abundances and corresponding spectra can be used as a probe of
depth-dependent $K_{\rm zz}$. At a given surface gravity, we find non-monotonic
behavior in the CO abundance as a function of $T_{\rm eff}$, as chemical
abundances are sometimes quenched in either of two potential atmospheric
convective zones, or quenched in either of two possible radiative zones. The
temperature structure and chemical quenching behavior also changes with
gravity. We compare our models with available near-infrared and M-band
spectroscopy of several T and Y-dwarfs and assess their atmospheric vertical
mixing profiles. We also compare to color-magnitude diagrams and make
predictions for JWST spectra. This work yields new constraints, and points the
way to significant future gains, in determining $K_{\rm zz}$, a fundamental
atmospheric parameter in substellar atmospheres, with significant implications
for chemistry and cloud modeling.

collected at a distance by passive sensors without subject cooperation, which

cameras and computer vision techniques to perform gait recognition. However,
vision-based methods are not reliable when confronting poor illuminations,
leading to degrading performances. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal
gait recognition method, namely GaitFi, which leverages WiFi signals and videos
for human identification. In GaitFi, Channel State Information (CSI) that
reflects the multi-path propagation of WiFi is collected to capture human
gaits, while videos are captured by cameras. To learn robust gait information,
we propose a Lightweight Residual Convolution Network (LRCN) as the backbone
network, and further propose the two-stream GaitFi by integrating WiFi and
vision features for the gait retrieval task. The GaitFi is trained by the
triplet loss and classification loss on different levels of features. Extensive
experiments are conducted in the real world, which demonstrates that the GaitFi
outperforms state-of-the-art gait recognition methods based on single WiFi or

However, growing coalesced ultra-thin Bi$_2$Se$_3$ films with a controllable

a few layers of \BiSe before the actual deposition -- is critical to obtaining

quiescent phase. Due to similar temporal shapes and spectra in the two
episodes, GRB 220627A is speculated to be a gravitationally lensed gamma-ray
burst (GRB). We analyze the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data and find that
about 49 gamma-ray photons above 100 MeV come from the GRB during the first
episode, while there are no photons above 100 MeV in the second episode. Based
on the broadband spectral study of the two episodes, the gravitationally
lensing scenario can be ruled out at a high confidence level and we thus
conclude that GRB 220627A is an intrinsically ultralong GRB with the prompt
burst emission lasting longer than 1000 s. It is then the first case that GeV
emission is detected from an ultralong GRB. We find that a short spike seen in
the LAT light curve is also present in GBM detectors that see the burst,
suggesting a common internal region of emission across the entire Fermi energy
range. The detection of a 15.7 GeV photon during the early prompt phase places
a lower limit of $\Gamma\ge300$ on the bulk Lorentz factor of the GRB ejecta.
The constraint on the bulk Lorentz factor could shed light on the origin of
ultralong GRBs.

jointly describes spin-polarized hot electron transport and spin pumping driven

generation in laser-excited magnetic heterostructures. The model is used to
compare the two contributions directly. The spin-polarized hot electron current
is modeled as one generation of hot electrons with a spin-dependent excitation
and relaxation scheme. Upon decay, the excess energy of the hot electrons is
transferred to a thermalized electron bath. The elevated electron temperature
leads to an increased rate of electron-magnon scattering processes and yields a
local accumulation of spin. This process is dubbed as spin pumping by local
heating. The built-up spin accumulation is effectively driven out of the
ferromagnetic system by (interfacial) electron transport. Within our model, the
injected spin current is dominated by the contribution resulting from spin
pumping, while the hot electron spin current remains relatively small. We

musical form. In this paper, we develop MeloForm, a system that generates
melody with musical form using expert systems and neural networks.
Specifically, 1) we design an expert system to generate a melody by developing
musical elements from motifs to phrases then to sections with repetitions and
variations according to pre-given musical form; 2) considering the generated
melody is lack of musical richness, we design a Transformer based refinement
model to improve the melody without changing its musical form. MeloForm enjoys
the advantages of precise musical form control by expert systems and musical
richness learning via neural models. Both subjective and objective experimental
evaluations demonstrate that MeloForm generates melodies with precise musical
form control with 97.79% accuracy, and outperforms baseline systems in terms of
subjective evaluation score by 0.75, 0.50, 0.86 and 0.89 in structure,
thematic, richness and overall quality, without any labelled musical form data.
Besides, MeloForm can support various kinds of forms, such as verse and chorus
form, rondo form, variational form, sonata form, etc.

The entirety of this event was covered by RHESSI, IRIS, and Hinode/EIS,
allowing analysis of the chromospheric response to a nonthermal electron
driver. We derived the energy contained in nonthermal electrons via RHESSI
spectral fitting, and linked the time-dependent parameters of this call to the
response in Doppler velocity, density, and nonthermal width across a broad
temperature range. The total energy injected was $4.8\times10^{30}$ erg, and
lasted $352$ seconds. This energy drove explosive chromospheric evaporation,
with a delineation in both Doppler and nonthermal velocities at the flow
reversal temperature, between 1.35--1.82 MK. The time of peak electron
injection (14:06 UT) corresponded to the time of highest velocities. At this
time, we found 200 km s$^{-1}$ blueshifts in the core of Fe XXIV, which is
typically assumed to be at rest. Shortly before this time, the nonthermal
electron population had the shallowest spectral index ($\approx$ 6),
corresponding to the peak nonthermal velocity in Si IV and Fe XXI. Nonthermal
velocities in Fe XIV, formed near the flow reversal temperature were low, and
not correlated with density or Doppler velocity. Nonthermal velocities in ions
with similar temperatures were observed to increase and correlate with Doppler
velocities, implying unresolved flows surrounding the flow reversal point. This
study provides a comprehensive, time-resolved set of chromospheric diagnostics
for a large X-class flare, along with a time-resolved energy injection profile,
ideal for further modeling studies.

heterogeneity in the peritumoral region used various imaging modalities, but
information of extracellular free water movement restriction has been limitedly
explored. Here, we derive a unique set of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based
markers capturing the heterogeneity of tumor infiltration, by characterizing
free water movement restriction in the peritumoral region using Diffusion
Tensor Imaging (DTI)-based free water volume fraction maps. A novel voxel-wise
deep learning-based peritumoral microenvironment index (PMI) is first extracted
by leveraging the widely different water diffusivity properties of
glioblastomas and brain metastases as regions with and without infiltrations in
the peritumoral tissue. Descriptive characteristics of locoregional hubs of
uniformly high PMI values are extracted as AI-based markers to capture distinct
aspects of infiltrative heterogeneity. The proposed markers are applied to two
clinical use cases on an independent population of 275 adult-type diffuse
gliomas (CNS WHO grade 4), analyzing the duration of survival among
Isocitrate-Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)-wildtypes and the differences with

wall of the grooved channel is provided with constant heat flux while upper
wall insulated. Computations were carried out using WMLES model in LES

simulations are performed over varying Reynolds numbers range of 3000-30000 at
different ratios groove width to channel height (B/H) in the range 0.75-1.75.
The groove pitch ratio, and depth ratio kept constant of magnitude 2 and 0.5
respectively. Estimation of coefficient of heat transfer, associated frictional
losses, and magnitude of heat enhancement are systematically carried out and
compared with reported results in literature obtained using RANS framework
reported in literature. The results obtained using LES show improvements in the
heat transfer rate by a reasonable magnitude of 45% while the associated
frictional losses decreased by an average magnitude of 40% compared to results
obtained using RANS formulation in the aforementioned range of Re. Further, a
maximum magnitude of 64% improvement in the thermal enhancement factor is
achieved using LES for a B/H ratio of 0.75. Two correlations are proposed to
calculate the friction factor and thermal enhancement factor for a given Re, Nu

for the both new and old dynamical Hamiltonian variables. However, in addition
to this any true canonical transformations defined in the metric gravity, which
is a constrained dynamical system, must also guarantee the exact conservation
of the total Hamiltonians $H_t$ (in the both formulations) and preservation of
the algebra of first-class constraints. We show that Dirac's modifications of
the classical Hamilton method contain a number of crucial advantages, which
provide an obvious superiority of this method in order to develop various
non-contradictory Hamiltonian theories of many physical fields, when a number
of gauge conditions are also important. Theory of integral invariants and its
applications to the Hamiltonian metric gravity are also discussed. For
Hamiltonian dynamical systems with first-class constraints this theory leads to
a number of peculiarities some of which have been investigated.

  Exploitation of Idle Times",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In ridepooling systems with electric fleets, charging is a complex
decision-making process. Most electric vehicle (EV) taxi services require
drivers to make egoistic decisions, leading to decentralized ad-hoc charging
strategies. The current state of the mobility system is often lacking or not
shared between vehicles, making it impossible to make a system-optimal
decision. Most existing approaches do not combine time, location and duration
into a comprehensive control algorithm or are unsuitable for real-time
operation. We therefore present a real-time predictive charging method for
ridepooling services with a single operator, called Idle Time Exploitation
(ITX), which predicts the periods where vehicles are idle and exploits these
periods to harvest energy. It relies on Graph Convolutional Networks and a
linear assignment algorithm to devise an optimal pairing of vehicles and
charging stations, in pursuance of maximizing the exploited idle time. We
evaluated our approach through extensive simulation studies on real-world
datasets from New York City. The results demonstrate that ITX outperforms all
baseline methods by at least 5% (equivalent to $70,000 for a 6,000 vehicle
operation) per week in terms of a monetary reward function which was modeled to
replicate the profitability of a real-world ridepooling system. Moreover, ITX
can reduce delays by at least 4.68% in comparison with baseline methods and
generally increase passenger comfort by facilitating a better spread of
customers across the fleet. Our results also demonstrate that ITX enables
vehicles to harvest energy during the day, stabilizing battery levels and
increasing resilience to unexpected surges in demand. Lastly, compared to the
best-performing baseline strategy, peak loads are reduced by 17.39% which
benefits grid operators and paves the way for more sustainable use of the
electrical grid.

including Microsoft Bing. To leverage powerful transformers like BERT in this
low-latency setting, many existing approaches perform ad-side computations
offline. While efficient, these approaches are unable to serve cold start ads,
resulting in poor relevance predictions for such ads. This work aims to design
a new, low-latency BERT via structured pruning to empower real-time online
inference for cold start ads relevance on a CPU platform. Our challenge is that
previous methods typically prune all layers of the transformer to a high,
uniform sparsity, thereby producing models which cannot achieve satisfactory
inference speed with an acceptable accuracy.
  In this paper, we propose SwiftPruner - an efficient framework that leverages
evolution-based search to automatically find the best-performing layer-wise
sparse BERT model under the desired latency constraint. Different from existing
evolution algorithms that conduct random mutations, we propose a reinforced
mutator with a latency-aware multi-objective reward to conduct better mutations
for efficiently searching the large space of layer-wise sparse models.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher
ROC AUC and lower latency than the uniform sparse baseline and state-of-the-art
search methods. Remarkably, under our latency requirement of 1900us on CPU,
SwiftPruner achieves a 0.86% higher AUC than the state-of-the-art uniform
sparse baseline for BERT-Mini on a large scale real-world dataset. Online A/B
testing shows that our model also achieves a significant 11.7% cut in the ratio

problem that today costs an enormous number of victims. Several technologies
have been proposed to prevent accidents, being Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)
one of the most promising. In this context, BCIs have been used to detect
emotional states, concentration issues, or stressful situations, which could
play a fundamental role in the road since they are directly related to the
drivers' decisions. However, there is no extensive literature applying BCIs to
detect subjects' emotions in driving scenarios. In such a context, there are
some challenges to be solved, such as (i) the impact of performing a driving
task on the emotion detection and (ii) which emotions are more detectable in
driving scenarios. To improve these challenges, this work proposes a framework
focused on detecting emotions using electroencephalography with machine
learning and deep learning algorithms. In addition, a use case has been
designed where two scenarios are presented. The first scenario consists in
listening to sounds as the primary task to perform, while in the second
scenario listening to sound becomes a secondary task, being the primary task
using a driving simulator. In this way, it is intended to demonstrate whether
BCIs are useful in this driving scenario. The results improve those existing in
the literature , achieving 99% accuracy for the detection of two emotions
(non-stimuli and angry), 93% for three emotions (non-stimuli, angry and
neutral) and 75% for four emotions (non-stimuli, angry, neutral and joy).

classification tasks. However, since their performance is usually measured in
controlled settings, it is important to ensure that their decisions remain
correct when deployed in noisy environments. In fact, deep networks are not
robust to a large variety of semantic-preserving image modifications, even to
imperceptible image changes known as adversarial perturbations. The poor
robustness of image classifiers to small data distribution shifts raises
serious concerns regarding their trustworthiness. To build reliable machine
learning models, we must design principled methods to analyze and understand
the mechanisms that shape robustness and invariance. This is exactly the focus
of this thesis.
  First, we study the problem of computing sparse adversarial perturbations. We
exploit the geometry of the decision boundaries of image classifiers for
computing sparse perturbations very fast, and reveal a qualitative connection
between adversarial examples and the data features that image classifiers
learn. Then, to better understand this connection, we propose a geometric
framework that connects the distance of data samples to the decision boundary,
with the features existing in the data. We show that deep classifiers have a
strong inductive bias towards invariance to non-discriminative features, and
that adversarial training exploits this property to confer robustness. Finally,
we focus on the challenging problem of generalization to unforeseen corruptions
of the data, and we propose a novel data augmentation scheme for achieving
state-of-the-art robustness to common corruptions of the images.
  Overall, our results contribute to the understanding of the fundamental
mechanisms of deep image classifiers, and pave the way for building more

black holes mimics the behavior of the Van der Walls liquid. Quantities
conjugated to the coupling of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) and a magnetic
charge are obtained. Thermodynamic critical points of phase transitions are
investigated. It is demonstrated that the first law of black hole

understanding of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) by identifying and structuring
common characteristics within a taxonomy. NFTs are hyped and increasingly
marketed as essential building blocks of the Metaverse. However, the dynamic
evolution of the NFT space has posed challenges for those seeking to develop a
deep and comprehensive understanding of NFTs, their features, and capabilities.
  Design/methodology/approach: Utilizing common guidelines for the creation of
taxonomies, we developed (over three iterations), a multi-layer taxonomy based
on workshops and interviews with 11 academic and 15 industry experts. Through
an evaluation of 25 NFTs, we demonstrate the usefulness of our taxonomy.
  Findings: The taxonomy has four layers, 14 dimensions and 42 characteristics,
which describe NFTs in terms of reference object, token properties, token
distribution, and realizable value.
  Originality: Our framework is the first to systematically cover the emerging
NFT phenomenon. It is concise yet extendible and presents many avenues for
future research in a plethora of disciplines. The characteristics identified in
our taxonomy are useful for NFT and Metaverse related research in Finance,
Marketing, Law, and Information Systems. Additionally, the taxonomy can serve
as an information source for policymakers as they consider NFT regulation.

healthcare sector towards more personalized and IoT-based healthcare services.
These services are realized through control and monitoring applications that
are typically developed using artificial intelligence/machine learning-based
algorithms, which play a significant role in highlighting the efficiency of
traditional healthcare systems. Current personalized healthcare services are
dedicated to a specific environment to support technological personalization.
However, they are unable to consider different interrelated health conditions,
leading to inappropriate diagnoses and affecting sustainability and the
long-term health of patients. To this end, current Healthcare 5.0 technology
has evolved that supersede previous healthcare technologies. The goal of
healthcare 5.0 is to achieve an autonomous healthcare service, that takes into
account the interdependent effect of different health conditions of a patient.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey on personalized healthcare services.
In particular, we first present an overview of key requirements of
comprehensive personalized healthcare services in modern healthcare Internet of
Things (HIoT), including the definition of personalization and an example use
case scenario as a representative for modern HIoT. Second, we explored a
fundamental three-layer architecture for IoT-based healthcare systems using AI
and non-AI-based approaches, considering key requirements for CPHS followed by
their strengths and weaknesses in the frame of personalized healthcare
services. Third, we highlighted different security threats against each layer
of IoT architecture along with the possible AI and non-AI-based solutions.
Finally, we propose a methodology to develop reliable, resilient, and
personalized healthcare services that address the identified weaknesses of
existing approaches.

undertaken to illustrate the literature review findings with real-world
scenarios. Published literature identifies that smart homes may pose threats to
confidentiality (unwanted release of information), authentication (sensing
information being falsified) and unauthorised access to system controls. Most
existing studies focus on privacy intrusions as a prevalent form of harm
against smart homes. Other types of harms that are less common in the
literature include hacking, malware and DoS attacks. Digital harms, and data
associated with these harms, may vary extensively across smart devices. Most
studies propose technical measures to mitigate digital harms, while fewer
consider social prevention mechanisms. We also identify salient gaps in
research, and argue that these should be addressed in future cross-disciplinary
research initiatives.

would likely be a significant source of existential risk. Delaying the creation
of superintelligent AI (ASI) could decrease total existential risk by
increasing the amount of time humanity has to work on the AI alignment problem.
  However, since ASI could reduce most risks, delaying the creation of ASI
could also increase other existential risks, especially from advanced future
technologies such as synthetic biology and molecular nanotechnology.
  If AI existential risk is high relative to the sum of other existential risk,
delaying the creation of ASI will tend to decrease total existential risk and
vice-versa.
  Other factors such as war and a hardware overhang could increase AI risk and
cognitive enhancement could decrease AI risk. To reduce total existential risk,
humanity should take robustly positive actions such as working on existential
risk analysis, AI governance and safety, and reducing all sources of
existential risk by promoting differential technological development.

the geometrical-optics appearance of the Euler-Heisenberg (EH) black hole (BH)
under the different accretion flows context, which depends on the BH space-time
structure and different sources of light. The more significant magnetic charge
leads to the smaller shadow radius for the EH BH, while the different values of
the EH parameter do not ruin it. Different features of the corresponding
two-dimensional shadow images are derived for the three optically thin
accretion flow models. It is shown that the total observed intensity in the
static spherical accretion flow scenario leads than that of the infalling
spherical accretion flow under same parameters, but the size and position of
the EH BH shadows do not change in both of these accretions flows, implying
that the BH shadow size depends on the geometric space-time and the shadows
luminosities rely on the accretion flow morphology. Of particular interest is
that a thin disk accretion model illuminated the BH, we found that the
contribution of the lensing ring to the total observed flux is less than 5\%,
and the photon ring is less than 2\%, indicating that the direct emission
dominates the optical appearance of the EH BH. It is also believed that the
optical appearance of the BH image depends on the accretion disk radiation
position in this scenario, which can serve as a probe for the disk structure
around the active galactic nucleus (AGN) of M87^{*} like.

drug discovery. Compared with the virtual screening approach where a
pre-defined library of compounds are computationally screened, de novo drug
design based on the structure of a target protein can provide novel drug
candidates. In this paper, we present a generative solution named TamGent
(Target-aware molecule generator with Transformer) that can directly generate
candidate drugs from scratch for a given target, overcoming the limits imposed
by existing compound libraries. Following the Transformer framework (a
state-of-the-art framework in deep learning), we design a variant of
Transformer encoder to process 3D geometric information of targets and
pre-train the Transformer decoder on 10 million compounds from PubChem for
candidate drug generation. Systematical evaluation on candidate compounds
generated for targets from DrugBank shows that both binding affinity and
drugability are largely improved. TamGent outperforms previous baselines in
terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. The method is further verified by
generating candidate compounds for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and the
oncogenic mutant KRAS G12C. The results show that our method not only
re-discovers previously verified drug molecules , but also generates novel
molecules with better docking scores, expanding the compound pool and
potentially leading to the discovery of novel drugs.

  Technology","19 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) act as the core of vehicular communications
and provide the fundamental wireless communication architecture to support both
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication.
Therefore, by leveraging only communication technologies, Connected Vehicles
(CVs) can navigate through the dynamic road network. However, such vehicles are
still in their infancy but are expected to have a significant impact on safety
and mobility such as reducing non-recurrent congestion in case of a vehicle
breakdown or other roadway incidents. To evaluate their impacts, this research
examines the benefits of having CVs when a vehicle breakdown occurs by
developing an intelligent proactive re-routing algorithm. Due to a lack of
real-world data, this paper adopts an integrated simulated framework consisting
of a V2X (OMNET++) communication simulator and a traffic microscopic simulator
(SUMO). The developed algorithm functions such that when a vehicle is broken
down within a live traffic lane, the system detects the breakdown, generates
warning messages immediately and transmits them to approaching vehicles. Based
on the real-time notification, informed vehicles proactively re-route to
alternative roads to avoid the breakdown zone. Two scenarios were developed
where a breakdown occurs within and outside a junction for both V2X-enabled and
disabled systems. Results show that V2X-enabled CV re-routing mechanism can
improve traffic efficiency by reducing congestion and enhance traffic safety by
smoothing accelerations and decelerations of affected vehicles with low
infrastructure costs. The algorithm would be useful to highway agencies
(Department for Transport) and vehicle manufacturers in introducing CVs onto
existing road networks.

fundamental and harmonic components, appearing as lines in the power spectra at
frequencies ranging about from $0.5 Hz$ to $ 100 Hz$. Further interesting
features of the brainwave signals emerge by considering multiple syncronized
sequences of closed loops. In particular, we show that the fluctuations of the
number of syncronized loops leads to the onset of broadband power spectral
components.
  By effect of the fluctuations of the number of synchronized loops and the
emergence of the related broadband component, highly distorted waveform and
nonstationarity of the signal are observed, consistently with empirical EEG and

the location of visual sound sources in a video. Since collecting ground-truth
annotations of sounding objects can be costly, a plethora of weakly-supervised
localization methods that can learn from datasets with no bounding-box
annotations have been proposed in recent years, by leveraging the natural
co-occurrence of audio and visual signals. Despite significant interest,
popular evaluation protocols have two major flaws. First, they allow for the
use of a fully annotated dataset to perform early stopping, thus significantly
increasing the annotation effort required for training. Second, current
evaluation metrics assume the presence of sound sources at all times. This is
of course an unrealistic assumption, and thus better metrics are necessary to
capture the model's performance on (negative) samples with no visible sound
sources. To accomplish this, we extend the test set of popular benchmarks,
Flickr SoundNet and VGG-Sound Sources, in order to include negative samples,
and measure performance using metrics that balance localization accuracy and
recall. Using the new protocol, we conducted an extensive evaluation of prior
methods, and found that most prior works are not capable of identifying
negatives and suffer from significant overfitting problems (rely heavily on
early stopping for best results). We also propose a new approach for visual
sound source localization that addresses both these problems. In particular, we
found that, through extreme visual dropout and the use of momentum encoders,
the proposed approach combats overfitting effectively, and establishes a new
state-of-the-art performance on both Flickr SoundNet and VGG-Sound Source. Code
