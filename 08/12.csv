an avenue for the realization of energy-saving spintronics since they support
an extraordinarily long spin lifetime. However, the stability of the PST is
sensitively affected by symmetry breaking of the crystal induced by external
perturbation such as the electric field. In this paper, through
first-principles calculations supplemented by symmetry analysis, we report the
emergence of the robust and stable PST with large spin splitting in the
two-dimensional ferroelectric bilayer WTe$_{2}$. Due to the low symmetry of the
crystal ($C_{s}$ point group), we observe a canted PST in the spin-split bands
around the Fermi level displaying a unidirectional spin configuration tilted
along the $yz$ plane in the first Brillouin zone. Such a typical PST can be
effectively reversed by out-of-plane ferroelectric switching induced by
interlayer sliding along the in-plane direction. We further demonstrated that
the reversible PST is realized by the application of an out-of-plane external
electric field. Thus, our findings uncover the possibility of an electrically
tunable PST in the 2D materials, offering a promising platform for highly
efficient spintronics devices.

any communication system. Many common considerations of the security of a
wireless communication channel rely on comparing the signal level measured by
Bob (the intended receiver) to that accessible to Eve (an eavesdropper).
Frameworks such as Wyner's wiretap model ensure the security of a link, in an
average sense, when Bob's signal-to-noise ratio exceeds Eve's. Unfortunately,
because these guarantees rely on statistical assumptions about noise, Eve can
still occasionally succeed in decoding information. The goal of achieving
exactly zero probability of intercept over an engineered region of the
broadcast sector, which we term absolute security, remains elusive. Here, we
describe the first architecture for a wireless link which provides absolute
security. Our approach relies on the inherent properties of broadband and
high-gain antennas, and is therefore ideally suited for implementation in
millimeter-wave and terahertz wireless systems, where such antennas will
generally be employed. We exploit spatial minima of the antenna pattern at
different frequencies, the union of which defines a wide region where Eve is
guaranteed to fail regardless of her computational capabilities, and regardless
of the noise in the channels. Unlike conventional zero-forcing beam forming
methods, we show that, for realistic assumptions about the antenna
configuration and power budget, this absolute security guarantee can be
achieved over most possible eavesdropper locations. Since we use relatively
simple frequency-multiplexed coding, together with the underlying physics of a
diffracting aperture, this idea is broadly applicable in many contexts.

in transportation. Recently, spatial-temporal deep learning models demonstrate
the tremendous potential to enhance prediction accuracy. However, few studies
tackled the uncertainty and sparsity issues in fine-grained O-D matrices. This
presents a serious problem, because a vast number of zeros deviate from the
Gaussian assumption underlying the deterministic deep learning models. To
address this issue, we design a Spatial-Temporal Zero-Inflated Negative
Binomial Graph Neural Network (STZINB-GNN) to quantify the uncertainty of the
sparse travel demand. It analyzes spatial and temporal correlations using
diffusion and temporal convolution networks, which are then fused to
parameterize the probabilistic distributions of travel demand. The STZINB-GNN
is examined using two real-world datasets with various spatial and temporal
resolutions. The results demonstrate the superiority of STZINB-GNN over
benchmark models, especially under high spatial-temporal resolutions, because
of its high accuracy, tight confidence intervals, and interpretable parameters.
The sparsity parameter of the STZINB-GNN has physical interpretation for
various transportation applications.

find a bubble age >2.2 Myr, suggesting formation before the current

present the time-averaged spectra and rms spectra for the entire sample, which
show a variety of properties. Based on the spectral shape, we divide the rms
spectra into five subtypes and the time-averaged spectra into four subtypes.
The most common shape of the rms spectra is concave-down where the rms peaks at
$\sim$ 1 keV. We find that different sources can show similar time-averaged
spectra and rms spectra. However, there is no one-to-one mapping between the
subtypes of the time-averaged spectra and rms spectra, as similar time-averaged
spectra can be accompanied by different rms spectra, and vice versa. This is
likely because different physical mechanisms can produce similar rms spectra.
For every subtype of the time-averaged spectra, we report its preferred
subtypes of the rms spectra in both low- and high-frequency bands. We also
compare the statistical properties for different subtypes, such as the black
hole mass and Eddington ratio. Finally, we investigate the rms in the Fe
K$\alpha$ line regime and find that those with a broad and extended red-wing
profile tend to show stronger variability than those showing a narrow or
relatively symmetric profile. Our results demonstrate the necessity of
performing joint spectral and variability modeling in order to understand the
mechanism of the X-ray emission in AGN. All of the rms spectra have been made

lattice mismatched materials, exfoliation of free-standing membranes, and
re-use of expensive substrates. However, clear experimental evidence of a
remote mechanism remains elusive. In many cases, due to contaminants at the
transferred graphene/substrate interface, alternative mechanisms such as
pinhole-seeded lateral epitaxy or van der Waals epitaxy can explain the
resulting exfoliatable single-crystalline films. Here, we find that growth of
the Heusler compound GdPtSb on clean graphene on sapphire substrates produces a
30 degree rotated epitaxial superstructure that cannot be explained by pinhole
or van der Waals epitaxy. With decreasing growth temperature the volume
fraction of this 30 degree domain increases compared to the direct epitaxial 0
degree domain, which we attribute to slower surface diffusion at low
temperature that favors remote epitaxy, compared to faster surface diffusion at
high temperature that favors pinhole epitaxy. We further show that careful
graphene/substrate annealing ($T\sim 700 ^\circ C$) and consideration of the
film/substrate vs film/graphene lattice mismatch are required to obtain epitaxy
to the underlying substrate for a variety of other Heusler films, including
LaPtSb and GdAuGe. The 30 degree rotated superstructure provides a possible
experimental fingerprint of remote epitaxy since it is inconsistent with the
leading alternative mechanisms.

Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS). The public likelihoods PyBird and
CLASS-PT lead to results in agreement only at the $1\sigma$ level, despite the
fact that they are derived from the same BOSS dataset and theory model. We
perform a thorough comparison of the various analyses choices made between the
two pipelines, and identify that the differences come from the choice of prior
on the EFT parameters, dubbed ""West-coast"" (WC) and ""East-coast"" (EC) prior,
respectively associated to PyBird and CLASS-PT. In particular, because
posteriors are non-Gaussian, projection effects from the marginalization over
the EFT parameters shift the posterior mean of the cosmological parameters with
respect to the best-fit up to $1\sigma$ in the WC prior and up to $2\sigma$ in
the EC prior. We quantify that best-fit cosmological parameters extracted from
BOSS given the two prior choices are consistent at $\sim 1\sigma$. The
consistency improves to $\sim 0.5\sigma$ when doubling the prior widths. While
this reveals that current EFT analyses are subject to prior effects, we show
that cosmological results obtained in combination with CMB, or from forthcoming
large-volume data, are less sensitive to those effects. In addition, we
investigate differences between BOSS measurements. We find broad agreements
across all pre-reconstructed measurements considered ($<0.6\sigma$), but the
two available BOSS post-reconstructed measurements in Fourier space, once
combined with the EFT full-shape analysis, lead to discrepant Hubble parameter
$H_0$ at $\sim 0.9\sigma$. Given the various effects we discuss, we argue that
the clustering amplitude $\sigma_8$ measured with BOSS is not in statistical
tension with that inferred from Planck under $\Lambda$CDM.

prediction from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTBOSS)
have led to new constraints on extensions to the $\Lambda$CDM model, such as
Early Dark Energy (EDE) which has been suggested as a resolution to the ""Hubble
tension"". In this paper, we re-assess the constraining power of the EFTBOSS on
EDE in light of a correction to the normalization of BOSS window functions.
Overall we find that constraints from EFTBOSS on EDE are weakened, and
represent a small change compared to constraints from Planck and the
conventional BAO/$f\sigma_8$ measurements. The combination of Planck data with
EFTBOSS provides a bound on the maximal fractional contribution of EDE $f_{\rm
EDE}<0.083$ at 95% C.L. (compared to $<0.054$ with the incorrect normalization,
and $<0.088$ without full-shape data) and the Hubble tension is reduced to
$2.1\sigma$. However, the more extreme model favored by an analysis with just
data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope is disfavored by the EFTBOSS data. We
also show that the updated Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova analysis can slightly
increase the constraints on EDE. Yet, the inclusion of the SN1a magnitude
calibration by SH0ES strongly increases the preference for EDE to above
$5\sigma$, yielding $f_{\rm EDE}\sim 0.12^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$ around the redshift
$z_c=4365^{+3000}_{-1100}$. Our results demonstrate that EFTBOSS data (alone or
combined with Planck data) do not exclude the EDE resolution of the Hubble

emphasizing novel cavity-induced pathway interferences with the molecular
electronic coupling pathways, as these interferences allow a new kind of ET
rate tuning. We also examined the ET kinetics for both low and high cavity
frequency regimes as the light-matter coupling strength is varied. The
interference between the cavity-induced and intrinsic molecular coupling
pathway interference is defined by the cavity properties, including the cavity
frequency and the light-matter coupling interaction strength. Thus,
manipulating the cavity-induced interferences with the chemical coupling
pathways offers new strategies to direct charge flow at the nanoscale.

systems, after an initial perturbation, take an exceptionally long time to
return to equilibrium. It is universally observed in the dynamics of bosonic
excitations, like order-parameter collective modes, but it is not generally
expected to occur for fermionic excitations because of the half-integer nature
of the fermionic spin. Direct observation of CSD in fermionic excitations or
quasiparticles would therefore be of fundamental significance. Here, we observe
fermionic CSD in the heavy-fermion (HF) compound YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ by terahertz
time-domain spectroscopy. HFs are compound objects with a strongly enhanced
effective mass, composed of itinerant and localized electronic states. We see
that near the quantum phase transition in YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ the build-up of
spectral weight of the HFs towards the Kondo temperature $T_K\approx 25$ K is
followed by a logarithmic rise of the quasiparticle excitation rate on the
heavy-Fermi-liquid side of the quantum phase transition below $10$ K. A
critical two-band HF liquid theory shows that this is indicative of fermionic
CSD. This CSD is a clear indication that the HF quasiparticles experience a
breakdown near the quantum phase transition, and the critical exponent of this
breakdown introduces a classification of fermionic quantum phase transitions
analogous to thermodynamic phase transitions - solution to a long-standing

Ohnesorge number and Bond number at the transition, respectively. This

processes that operate over different timescales. The Extended Regulator model
provides an analytic framework for the resulting variability (or `burstiness')
in galaxy-wide star formation due to these processes. It does this by relating
the variability in Fourier space to the effective timescales of stochastic gas
inflow, equilibrium, and dynamical processes influencing GMC creation and
destruction using the power spectral density (PSD) formalism. We use the
connection between the PSD and auto-covariance function (ACF) for general
stochastic processes to reformulate this model as an auto-covariance function,
which we use to model variability in galaxy star formation histories (SFHs)
using physically-motivated Gaussian Processes in log SFR space. Using stellar
population synthesis models, we then explore how changes in model stochasticity
can affect spectral signatures across galaxy populations with properties
similar to the Milky Way and present-day dwarfs as well as at higher redshifts.
We find that, even at fixed scatter, perturbations to the stochasticity model
(changing timescales vs overall variability) leave unique spectral signatures

spectral features including H$\alpha$ and UV-based SFR indicators, H$\delta$

state, and a photogenerated electron-hole pair. The dynamical evolution from
the hole magnetic polaron to the trion magnetic polaron is accompanied by a
spin-flip of the electron, which results in negative circular polarization of
the photoluminescence. The degree of circular polarization reaches $-8\%$ at
zero magnetic field and strongly decreases in transverse magnetic fields
exceeding 0.2 T. Our model considerations show that different localization
sizes of the resident and photogenerated holes and the resulting difference in
their exchange interaction with the Mn$^{2+}$ spins maintains Mn spin
polarization. The resulting exchange field of Mn acting on the electron
provides a robust spin polarization of the trion magnetic polaron. We evaluate
the electron exchange energy in the T$^+$MP to be 0.19~meV, and the T$^+$MP
binding energy to be about 0.5 - 1 meV.

distinct ramping time scales depending on whether the charge density wave (CDW)

the latter to prevent entangled excited states from being accessed during the

enhancement of the entanglement entropy with respect to its initial value,
which precedes the formation of the CDW ordering; a similar enhancement is not
seen in the quench towards SDW. Our findings also show that the breaking of the

gravitational energy, the substantivalist-relationalist issue, and the
(non)exceptional status of gravity are interrelated. If space-time has
energy-momentum, then space-time is substantival. Two extant ways to avoid the
substantivalist conclusion deny that the energy-bearing metric is part of
space-time or deny that gravitational energy exists. Feynman linked doubts
about gravitational energy to GR-exceptionalism; particle physics
egalitarianism encourages realism about gravitational energy.
  This essay proposes a third view, involving a particle physics-inspired
non-perturbative split that characterizes space-time with a constant background
_matrix_ (not a metric), avoiding the inference from gravitational energy to
substantivalism: space-time is (M, eta), where eta=diag(-1,1,1,1) is a
spatio-temporally constant numerical signature matrix (already used in GR with
spinors). The gravitational potential, bearing any gravitational energy, is
g_(munu)(x)-eta (up to field redefinitions), an _affine_ geometric object with
a tensorial Lie derivative and a vanishing covariant derivative. This
non-perturbative split permits strong fields, arbitrary coordinates, and
arbitrary topology, and hence is pure GR by almost any standard. This
razor-thin background, unlike more familiar ones, involves no extra gauge
freedom and so lacks their obscurities and carpet lump-moving.
  After a discussion of Curiel's GR exceptionalist rejection of energy
conservation, the two traditional objections to pseudotensors, coordinate
dependence and nonuniqueness, are explored. Both objections are inconclusive
and getting weaker. A literal interpretation of Noether's theorem (infinitely
many energies) largely answers Schroedinger's false-negative coordinate
dependence problem. Bauer's nonuniqueness (false positive) objection has
several answers.

quadratically convergent root-bracketing techniques or Chebyshev interpolation
to locate bifurcation points. Only positive singular values have to be
computed, though the method relies on the existence of an analytic or smooth
singular value decomposition (SVD). The sign of the determinant of the
Jacobian, computed as part of the bidiagonal reduction in the SVD algorithm,
eliminates slope discontinuities at the zeros of the smallest singular value.
We use the method to search for spatially quasi-periodic traveling water waves
that bifurcate from large-amplitude periodic waves. The water wave equations
are formulated in a conformal mapping framework to facilitate the computation
of the quasi-periodic Dirichlet-Neumann operator. We find examples of pure
gravity waves with zero surface tension and overhanging gravity-capillary
waves. In both cases, the waves have two spatial quasi-periods whose ratio is
irrational. We follow the secondary branches via numerical continuation beyond
the realm of linearization about solutions on the primary branch to obtain
traveling water waves that extend over the real line with no two crests or
troughs of exactly the same shape. The pure gravity wave problem is of
relevance to ocean waves, where capillary effects can be neglected. Such waves
can only exist through secondary bifurcation as they do not persist to zero
amplitude. The gravity-capillary wave problem demonstrates the effectiveness of
using the signed smallest singular value as a test function for multi-parameter
bifurcation problems. This test function becomes mesh independent once the mesh
is fine enough.

better constraints are possible when combining these and other future probes

binaries could achieve a precision on the sum of neutrino masses of

to orbital hybridization, the nontrivial topology of the p-orbital HOTI is
hidden if bulk polarization is used as the topological invariant, but well
manifested by the generalized winding number. Our work opens a pathway for the
exploration of intriguing orbital phenomena mediated by higher band topology

point clouds has become a central topic in 3D understanding. Despite rapid

clouds, and have weaker than necessary performance when encountering geometric
transformation distortions. To overcome this challenge, we propose PointTree, a
general-purpose point cloud encoder that is robust to transformations based on
relaxed K-D trees. Key to our approach is the design of the division rule in
K-D trees by using principal component analysis (PCA). We use the structure of
the relaxed K-D tree as our computational graph, and model the features as
border descriptors which are merged with pointwise-maximum operation. In
addition to this novel architecture design, we further improve the robustness
by introducing pre-alignment -- a simple yet effective PCA-based normalization

Our key technical insight is the use of an energy-based formulation for

explicitly represent multiple camera modes arising from object symmetries or

models. Further, the bending models are compared computationally through four
classical benchmark examples and one contact example. As the underlying shell

functions and spatial distributions that broadly agree with observations. We
first examine trends in orbital dynamics at z = 0, including total velocity,
specific angular momentum, and specific total energy: the time of infall into
the MW-mass halo primarily determines these orbital properties. We then examine
orbital histories, focusing on the lookback time of first infall into a host
halo and pericenter distances, times, and counts. Roughly 37 per cent of
galaxies with Mstar < 10^7 Msun were `pre-processed' as a satellite in a
lower-mass group, typically ~2.7 Gyr before falling into the MW-mass halo. Half
of all satellites at z = 0 experienced multiple pericenters about their MW-mass
host. Remarkably, for most (67 per cent) of these satellites, their most recent
pericenter was not their minimum pericenter: the minimum typically was ~40 per
cent smaller and occurred ~6 Gyr earlier. These satellites with growing
pericenters appear to have multiple origins: for about half, their specific
angular momentum gradually increased over time, while for the other half, most
rapidly increased near their first apocenter, suggesting that a combination of
a time-dependent MW-mass halo potential and dynamical perturbations in the
outer halo caused these satellites' pericenters to grow. Our results highlight

objects that have gained attention as a potential formation route for globular
clusters. SIGOs have only recently begun to be studied in the context of
molecular hydrogen cooling, which is key to characterizing their structure and
evolution. Studying the population-level properties of SIGOs with molecular
cooling is important for understanding their potential for collapse and star
formation, and central for addressing whether SIGOs can survive to the present
epoch. Here, we investigate the evolution of SIGOs before they form stars,
using a combination of numerical and analytical analysis. For example, we study
various timescales important to the evolution of SIGOs at a population level in
the presence of molecular cooling. Revising the previous formulation for the
critical density of collapse for SIGOs allows us to show that their prolateness
tends to act as an inhibiting factor to collapse. We find that simulated SIGOs
are limited by artificial two-body relaxation effects that tend to disperse
them, an effect of their limited resolution. We expect that SIGOs in nature
will be longer-lived compared to our simulations. Further, the fall-back
timescale on which SIGOs fall into nearby dark matter halos, potentially
producing a globular-cluster-like system, is frequently longer than their
cooling timescale and the collapse timescale on which they shrink through
gravity. Therefore, some SIGOs have time to cool and collapse outside of halos
despite initially failing to exceed the critical density, even without
considering metal line cooling. From this analysis we conclude that SIGOs
should form stars outside of halos in non-negligible stream velocity patches in
the Universe.

and yet the intrinsically carbon-enriched DQ spectral class members fail to
experience this phenomenon, representing a decades-old conundrum. This study
reports a high-resolution spectroscopic search for Ca II in classical DQ white
dwarfs, finding that these stars are stunted both in pollution frequency and
heavy element mass fractions, relative to the wider population. Compared to
other white dwarf spectral classes, the average external accretion rate is
found to be at least three orders of magnitude lower in the DQ stars. Several
hypotheses are considered which need to simultaneously account for i) an
apparent lack of accreted metals, ii) a dearth of circumstellar planetary
material, iii) an observed deficit of unevolved companions in post-common
envelope binaries, iv) relatively low helium mass fractions, and remnant masses
that appear smaller than for other spectral classes, v) a high incidence of
strong magnetism, and vi) modestly older disk kinematics. Only one hypothesis
is consistent with all these constraints, suggesting DQ white dwarfs are the
progeny of binary evolution that altered both their stellar structures and
their circumstellar environments. A binary origin is already suspected for the
warmer and more massive DQ stars, and is proposed here as an inclusive
mechanism to expose core carbon material, in a potential evolutionary
unification for the entire DQ spectral class. In this picture, DQ stars are not
descended from DA or DB white dwarfs that commonly host dynamically-active

estimate the system-state of the process system. However, adversaries aim at
distorting the system-state estimate, for which they may infiltrate sensors or
position additional devices in the environment. To authenticate the received
process values, the integrity of the measurements from different sensors can be
evaluated jointly with the temporal integrity of channel measurements from each
sensor. For this purpose, we design a security protocol, in which Kalman
filters are used to predict the system-state and the channel-state values, and
the received data are authenticated by a hypothesis test. We theoretically
analyze the adversarial success probability and the reliability rate obtained
in the hypothesis test in two ways, based on a chi-square approximation and on
a Gaussian approximation. The two approximations are exact for small and large
data vectors, respectively. The Gaussian approximation is suitable for
analyzing massive single-input multiple-output (SIMO) setups. To obtain
additional insights, the approximation is further adapted for the case of
channel hardening, which occurs in massive SIMO fading channels. As adversaries
always look for the weakest point of a system, a time-constant security level
is required. To provide such a service, the approximations are used to propose
time-varying threshold values for the hypothesis test, which approximately
attain a constant security level. Numerical results show that a constant
security level can only be achieved by a time-varying threshold choice, while a
constant threshold value leads to a time-varying security level.

with the gravity duals of two classes of states in the D1D5 CFT. For each class
the CFT states are in the untwisted sector, suggesting that the energy gap
should be $1/R_y$ where $R_y$ is the radius of the circle on which the D1D5 CFT
is compactified. For one class of states, the gravity dual indeed has exactly
this gap, while for the other class, the gravity dual has a very deep throat,
leading to an energy gap much smaller than $1/R_y$. We resolve this puzzle by
showing that for the latter class of states, perturbing the CFT off its free
point leads to the formation of a band structure in the CFT. We also explain
why such a band structure does not arise for the first class of states. Thus
for the case where a deep throat emerges in the gravity description, the
dynamics of falling down this throat is described in the CFT as a sequential
`hopping' between states all of which have the same energy at the free point;
this hopping amplitude converts an integer spaced spectrum into a closely
spaced band of energy levels.

the parameter f3 for cluster spirals compared to field spirals, where f3 is the

size $n$ require $\Omega(nk)$ rounds. In this paper, we see if these bounds can
be improved by smoothed analysis. We study perhaps the most natural randomized
algorithm for disseminating tokens in this setting: at every time step, choose
a token to broadcast randomly from the set of tokens you know. We show that
with even a small amount of smoothing (one random edge added per round), this
natural strategy solves $k$-message broadcast in $\tilde{O}(n+k^3)$ rounds,
with high probability, beating the best known bounds for $k=o(\sqrt{n})$ and
matching the $\Omega(n+k)$ lower bound for static networks for $k=O(n^{1/3})$
(ignoring logarithmic factors). In fact, the main result we show is even
stronger and more general: given $\ell$-smoothing (i.e., $\ell$ random edges
added per round), this simple strategy terminates in
$O(kn^{2/3}\log^{1/3}(n)\ell^{-1/3})$ rounds. We then prove this analysis close
to tight with an almost-matching lower bound. To better understand the impact
of smoothing on information spreading, we next turn our attention to static
networks, proving a tight bound of $\tilde{O}(k\sqrt{n})$ rounds to solve
$k$-message broadcast, which is better than what our strategy can achieve in
the dynamic setting. This confirms that although smoothed analysis reduces the
difficulties induced by changing graph structures, it does not eliminate them
altogether. Finally, we apply our tools to prove an optimal result for
$k$-message broadcast in so-called well-mixed networks in the absence of
smoothing. By comparing this result to an existing lower bound for well-mixed
networks, we establish a formal separation between oblivious and strongly
adaptive adversaries with respect to well-mixed token spreading, partially
resolving an open question on the impact of adversary strength on the

hydrogenation (especially of CO ice) is the dominant formation mechanism of

allows the recondensation of key volatiles onto dust grains, provides a region
of chemical enrichment of ices that is much closer to the star than within a
non-shadowed disk, and may explain to some degree the trapping of O$_{2}$ ice

simulation combines a model for the stellar corona and wind with an exoplanet
that is orbiting the star in a fully dynamic, time-dependent manner. Our
simulations generate synthetic radio images that enable us to obtain synthetic
radio lightcurves in different frequencies. We find a clear evidence for the
planetary motion in the radio light curves. Moreover, we find specific repeated
features in the light curves that are attributed to the passage of the
planetary magnetosphere in front of the star during transit. More importantly,
we find a clear dependence in the magnitude and phase of these lightcurve
features on the strength of the planetary magnetic field. Our work demonstrates
that if radio transits could be observed, they could indeed provide information
about the magnetic field strength of the transiting exoplanet. Future work to
parameterize these lightcurve features and their dependence on the planetary
field strength would provide tools to search for these features in radio
observations datasets. As we only consider the thermal radio emission from the
host star for our study, very sensitive radio interferometers are necessary to
detect these kinds of planetary transit in radio.

genetic drift, the ability of a population to explore a rugged fitness

steady-state fitness increases with population size, we find that the height of
the first fitness peak encountered when starting from a random genotype
displays various behaviors versus population size, even among small and simple
rugged landscapes. We show that the accessibility of the different fitness
peaks is key to determining whether this height overall increases or decreases
with population size. Furthermore, there is often a finite population size that
maximizes the height of the first fitness peak encountered when starting from a
random genotype. This holds across various classes of model rugged landscapes
with sparse peaks, and in some experimental and experimentally-inspired ones.
Thus, early adaptation in rugged fitness landscapes can be more efficient and
predictable for relatively small population sizes than in the large-size limit.

  Graphs: a Complete Classification","87 pages, 18 figures",,,,"cs.DS cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the Directed Steiner Network problem, the input is a directed graph G, a
subset T of k vertices of G called the terminals, and a demand graph D on T.
The task is to find a subgraph H of G with the minimum number of edges such
that for every edge (s,t) in D, the solution H contains a directed s to t path.
In this paper we investigate how the complexity of the problem depends on the
demand pattern when G is planar. Formally, if \mathcal{D} is a class of
directed graphs closed under identification of vertices, then the
\mathcal{D}-Steiner Network (\mathcal{D}-SN) problem is the special case where
the demand graph D is restricted to be from \mathcal{D}. For general graphs,
Feldmann and Marx [ICALP 2016] characterized those families of demand graphs
where the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) parameterized by the
number k of terminals. They showed that if \mathcal{D} is a superset of one of
the five hard families, then \mathcal{D}-SN is W[1]-hard parameterized by k,
otherwise it can be solved in time f(k)n^{O(1)}.
  For planar graphs an interesting question is whether the W[1]-hard cases can
be solved by subexponential parameterized algorithms. Chitnis et al. [SICOMP
2020] showed that, assuming the ETH, there is no f(k)n^{o(k)} time algorithm
for the general \mathcal{D}-SN problem on planar graphs, but the special case
called Strongly Connected Steiner Subgraph can be solved in time f(k)
n^{O(\sqrt{k})} on planar graphs. We present a far-reaching generalization and
unification of these two results: we give a complete characterization of the
behavior of every $\mathcal{D}$-SN problem on planar graphs. We show that
assuming ETH, either the problem is (1) solvable in time 2^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}, and
not in time 2^{o(k)}n^{O(1)}, or (2) solvable in time f(k)n^{O(\sqrt{k})}, but
not in time f(k)n^{o(\sqrt{k})}, or (3) solvable in time f(k)n^{O(k)}, but not

Engineering (SE) white-box testing. It aims to artificially inject faults in a
system to evaluate a test suite's capability to detect them, assuming that the
test suite defects finding capability will then translate to real faults. If MT
has long been used in SE, it is only recently that it started gaining the
attention of the Deep Learning (DL) community, with researchers adapting it to
improve the testability of DL models and improve the trustworthiness of DL
systems.
  Objective: If several techniques have been proposed for MT, most of them
neglected the stochasticity inherent to DL resulting from the training phase.
Even the latest MT approaches in DL, which propose to tackle MT through a
statistical approach, might give inconsistent results. Indeed, as their
statistic is based on a fixed set of sampled training instances, it can lead to
different results across instances set when results should be consistent for
any instance.
  Methods: In this work, we propose a Probabilistic Mutation Testing (PMT)
approach that alleviates the inconsistency problem and allows for a more
consistent decision on whether a mutant is killed or not.
  Results: We show that PMT effectively allows a more consistent and informed
decision on mutations through evaluation using three models and eight mutation
operators used in previously proposed MT methods. We also analyze the trade-off
between the approximation error and the cost of our method, showing that
relatively small error can be achieved for a manageable cost.
  Conclusion: Our results showed the limitation of current MT practices in DNN
and the need to rethink them. We believe PMT is the first step in that
direction which effectively removes the lack of consistency across test
executions of previous methods caused by the stochasticity of DNN training.

calculated analytically using multiple methods or numerically using the

Chapman-Enskog method agrees well with the Green-Kubo result for both isotropic

to study the shear viscosity of the parton matter from a multi-phase transport
model. In particular, we study the parton matter in the center cell of central
and midcentral Au+Au collisions at $200A$ GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at $2760A$
GeV, which is assumed to be a plasma in thermal equilibrium but partial
chemical equilibrium. As a result of using a constant Debye mass or cross
section $\sigma$ for parton scatterings, the $\eta/s$ ratio increases with time
(as the effective temperature decreases), contrary to the trend preferred by
Bayesian analysis of the experimental data or pQCD results that use
temperature-dependent Debye masses. At $\sigma=3$ mb that enables the transport
model to approximately reproduce the elliptic flow data of the bulk matter, the
average $\eta/s$ of the parton matter in partial equilibrium is found to be
very small, between one to two times $1/(4\pi)$.

patterns (and practices) encountered during training. Consequently, these

easy to use in an out-of-the-box way and include powerful learning associations

significant in Hamiltonian quantum gravity since the 1950s. This paper
considers the unrecognized variety of ideas about observables in the thought of
Peter Bergmann, who invented observables. Whereas initially he required a
constrained Hamiltonian formalism to be mathematically equivalent to the
Lagrangian, in 1953 Bergmann and Schiller introduced a novel postulate,
motivated by facilitating quantum gravity: observables were _invariant_ under
transformations generated by _each individual_ first-class constraint. While
modern works rely on Bergmann's authority and sometimes speak of ""Bergmann
observables,"" he had much to say about observables, plausible but not all
consistent or remembered.
  At times he required observables to be locally defined (not changeless and
global); at times he wanted them independent of the Hamiltonian formalism (not
essentially involving separate first-class constraints). But typically he took
observables to have vanishing Poisson bracket with each first-class constraint,
purportedly justified by electrodynamics. He expected observables to be
analogous to the transverse true degrees of freedom of electromagnetism. Hence
there is no coherent concept of observables which he reliably endorsed.
  A revised definition of observables that satisfies the requirement that
equivalent theories should have equivalent observables using the
Rosenfeld-Anderson-Bergmann-Castellani gauge generator $G$, a tuned sum of
first-class constraints that changes the canonical action $\int dt(p\dot{q}-H)$
by a boundary term. Bootstrapping from theory formulations with no first-class
constraints, the ""external"" coordinate symmetry of GR calls for covariance
($4$-dimensional Lie derivative), not invariance ($0$ Poisson bracket), under
$G$ (not each first-class constraint).

specifically, constant function market makers (CFMMs), from the economic

decompose the return of an LP into a instantaneous market risk component and a
non-negative, non-decreasing, and predictable component which we call
""loss-versus-rebalancing"" (LVR, pronounced ""lever""). Market risk can be fully
hedged, but once eliminated, LVR remains as a running cost that must be offset
by trading fee income in order for liquidity provision to be profitable. We
show how LVR can be interpreted in many ways: as the cost of pre-commitment, as
the time value for giving up future optionality, as the compensator in a
Doob-Meyer decomposition, as an adverse selection cost in the form of the
profits of arbitrageurs trading against the pool, and as an information cost
because the pool does not have access to accurate market prices. LVR is
distinct from the more commonly known metric of ""impermanent loss"" or
""divergence loss""; this latter metric is more fundamentally described as
""loss-versus-holding"" and is not a true running cost. We express LVR simply and
in closed-form: instantaneously, it is the scaled product of the variance of
prices and the marginal liquidity available in the pool, i.e., LVR is the
floating leg of a generalized variance swap. As such, LVR is easily calibrated
to market data and specific CFMM structure. LVR provides tradeable insight in

on the excessively large labeled image datasets. In order to reduce the
reliance on large labeled datasets, reconstruction based masked autoencoders
are gaining popularity, which learn high quality transferable representations
from unlabeled images. For the same purpose, recent weakly supervised image
pretraining methods explore language supervision from text captions
accompanying the images. In this work, we propose masked image pretraining on
language assisted representation, dubbed as MILAN. Instead of predicting raw
pixels or low level features, our pretraining objective is to reconstruct the
image features with substantial semantic signals that are obtained using
caption supervision. Moreover, to accommodate our reconstruction target, we
propose a more effective prompting decoder architecture and a semantic aware
mask sampling mechanism, which further advance the transfer performance of the
pretrained model. Experimental results demonstrate that MILAN delivers higher
accuracy than the previous works. When the masked autoencoder is pretrained and
finetuned on ImageNet-1K dataset with an input resolution of 224x224, MILAN
achieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.4% on ViT-Base, surpassing previous
state-of-the-arts by 1%. In the downstream semantic segmentation task, MILAN
achieves 52.7 mIoU using ViT-Base on ADE20K dataset, outperforming previous

and diagnose failures of rolling bearings. Accuracy and delay in detecting and
diagnosing different types of failures are the main performance measures in
condition monitoring. Achieving high accuracy with low delay improves system
reliability and prevents catastrophic equipment failure. Further, delay is
crucial to remote condition monitoring and time-sensitive industrial
applications. While most of the proposed methods focus on accuracy, slight
attention has been paid to addressing the delay introduced in the condition
monitoring process. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap and propose a
hybrid method for vibration-based condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of
rolling bearings that outperforms previous methods in terms of accuracy and
delay. Specifically, we address the overall delay in vibration-based condition
monitoring systems and introduce the concept of system delay to assess it.
Then, we present the proposed method for condition monitoring. It uses Wavelet
Packet Transform (WPT) and Fourier analysis to decompose short-duration input
segments of the vibration signal into elementary waveforms and obtain their
spectral contents. Accordingly, energy concentration in the spectral
components-caused by defect induced transient vibrations-is utilized to extract
a small number of features with high discriminative capabilities. Consequently,
Bayesian optimization-based Random Forest (RF) algorithm is used to classify
healthy and faulty operating conditions under varying motor speeds. The
experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve high accuracy
with low system delay.

applications, such as environmental monitoring and precision agriculture,
involve phenomena that are not directly observable or are costly to measure,
called latent phenomena. In our approach, we seek to reason about the latent
phenomenon in real-time by effectively sampling the observable spatial fields
using a team of robots with heterogeneous sensors, where each robot has a
distinct sensor to measure a different observable field. The information gain
is estimated using a learned model that maps from the observable spatial fields
to the latent phenomenon. This model captures aleatoric uncertainty in the
relationship to allow for information theoretic measures. Additionally, we
explicitly consider the correlations among the observable spatial fields,
capturing the relationship between sensor types whose observations are not
independent. We show it is possible to learn these correlations, and
investigate the impact of the learned correlation models on the performance of
our sampling approach. Through our qualitative and quantitative results, we
illustrate that empirically learned correlations improve the overall sampling

elastic objects using active sonar, we wish to separate the early-time returns
(e.g., returns from the object's exterior geometry) from late-time returns
caused by elastic or compressional wave coupling.
  Under the framework of Morphological Component Analysis (MCA), we compare two
separation models using the short-duration and long-duration responses as a
proxy for early-time and late-time returns. Results are computed for Stanton's
elastic cylinder model as well as on experimental data taken from an in-Air

are formed into imagery. We find that MCA can be used to separate early and

various fields including machine learning, data mining, and modern statistics.
Proximal gradient descent method and coordinate descent method are the most
popular approaches to solving the minimization problem. Although existing
methods can achieve implicit model identification, aka support set
identification, in a finite number of iterations, these methods still suffer
from huge computational costs and memory burdens in high-dimensional scenarios.
The reason is that the support set identification in these methods is implicit
and thus cannot explicitly identify the low-complexity structure in practice,
namely, they cannot discard useless coefficients of the associated features to
achieve algorithmic acceleration via dimension reduction. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel accelerated doubly stochastic gradient descent
(ADSGD) method for sparsity regularized loss minimization problems, which can
reduce the number of block iterations by eliminating inactive coefficients
during the optimization process and eventually achieve faster explicit model
identification and improve the algorithm efficiency. Theoretically, we first
prove that ADSGD can achieve a linear convergence rate and lower overall
computational complexity. More importantly, we prove that ADSGD can achieve a
linear rate of explicit model identification. Numerically, experimental results
on benchmark datasets confirm the efficiency of our proposed method.

been the detection of galaxies during the epoch of reionization, using deep
fields that have pushed these instruments to their limits. It is essential to
optimize our analyses of these fields in order to extract as much information
as possible from them. In particular, standard methods of measuring the galaxy
luminosity function discard information on large-scale dark matter density
fluctuations, even though this large-scale structure drives galaxy formation
and reionization during the Cosmic Dawn. Measuring these densities would
provide a bedrock observable, connecting galaxy surveys to theoretical models
of the reionization process and structure formation. Here, we use existing
Hubble deep field data to simultaneously fit the universal luminosity function
and measure large-scale densities for each Hubble deep field at $z =$ 6--8 by
directly incorporating priors on the large-scale density field and galaxy bias.
Our fit of the universal luminosity function is consistent with previous
methods but differs in the details. For the first time, we measure the
underlying densities of the survey fields, including the most over/under-dense
Hubble fields. We show that the distribution of densities is consistent with
current predictions for cosmic variance. This analysis on just 17 fields is a
small sample of what will be possible with the James Webb Space Telescope,
which will measure hundreds of fields at comparable (or better) depths and at
higher redshifts.

hadronic model including short-range correlations (SRC) and dark matter (DM)
content [Phys. Rev. D 105, 023008 (2022)]. As a dark particle candidate, we use
the lightest neutralino interacting with nucleons through the Higgs boson
exchange. In particular, we test the model against the constraints regarding
the observation of gravitational waves from the binary neutron star merger
GW170817 event provided by LIGO and Virgo collaboration (LVC). We show that
$\Lambda$ decreases as the dark particle Fermi momentum ($k_F^{DM}$) increases.
This feature favors the RMF-SRC-DM model used here to satisfy the limits of
$\Lambda_{1.4}=190^{+390}_{-120}$ ($\Lambda$ of a $1.4M_\odot$ neutron star),
and $\tilde{\Lambda}=300^{+420}_{-230}$ given by the LVC. We also show that as
$k_F^{DM}$ increases, $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$, namely, tidal
deformabilities of the binary system, are also moved to the direction of the
GW170817 observational data. Finally, we verify that the inclusion of DM in the
system does not destroy the \mbox{$I$-Love} relation (correlation between
$\Lambda$ and dimensionless moment of inertia, $\bar{I}$). The observation data
for $\bar{I}_\star\equiv\bar{I}(M_\star)=11.10^{+3.68}_{-2.28}$, with
$M_\star=1.338M_\odot$, is attained by the RMF-SRC-DM model.

the Reissner Nordstrom (RN) type is completely equivalent at the level of
equations of motion to the commutative U(1) gauge theory coupled to a
commutative scalar field and to a classical geometry background, different from
the starting RN background. The new (effective) metric is obtained from the RN

duality between two theories and physical systems they describe, we formulate
an effective approach to studying a dynamics of spin 1/2 fields on the curved
background of RN type with an abiding noncommutative structure. As opposed to
that, we also study the dynamics of spin 1/2 fields in a more formal way, by
studying the semiclassical theory which describes the NC U(1) gauge field
coupled with NC spin 1/2 field and also with gravity which is however treated
classically. Upon utilising the Seiberg Witten map in order to write the NC
spinor and NC gauge fields in terms of their corresponding commutative degrees
of freedom, we find that the equation of motion for the fermion field obtained
within the formal approach exactly coincides with the equation of motion
obtained within the effective approach that utilises noncommutative duality. We
then use these results to analyze the problem of stability of solutions of the

system to create favorable propagation conditions from base stations (BSs) to
users via configurable elements. However, prior works on RIS-aided cell-free
system designs mainly rely on the instantaneous channel state information
(CSI), which may incur substantial overhead due to extremely high dimensions of
estimated channels. To mitigate this issue, a low-complexity algorithm via the
two-timescale transmission protocol is proposed in this paper, where the joint
beamforming at BSs and RISs is facilitated via alternating optimization
framework to maximize the average weighted sum-rate. Specifically, the passive
beamformers at RISs are optimized through the statistical CSI, and the transmit
beamformers at BSs are based on the instantaneous CSI of effective channels. In
this manner, a closed-form expression for the achievable weighted sum-rate is
derived, which enables the evaluation of the impact of key parameters on system
performance. To gain more insights, a special case without line-of-sight (LoS)
components is further investigated, where a power gain on the order of
$\mathcal{O}(M)$ is achieved, with $M$ being the BS antennas number. Numerical
results validate the tightness of our derived analytical expression and show
the fast convergence of the proposed algorithm. Findings illustrate that the
performance of the proposed algorithm with two-timescale CSI is comparable to
that with instantaneous CSI in low or moderate SNR regime. The impact of key
system parameters such as the number of RIS elements, CSI settings and Rician
factor is also evaluated. Moreover, the remarkable advantages from the adoption
of the cell-free paradigm and the deployment of RISs are demonstrated
intuitively.

incomplete context for Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs) generation;

inefficient prediction of the CDR sequences in an autoregressive manner. In
this paper, we propose Multi-channel Equivariant Attention Network (MEAN) to
co-design 1D sequences and 3D structures of CDRs. To be specific, MEAN
formulates antibody design as a conditional graph translation problem by
importing extra components including the target antigen and the light chain of
the antibody. Then, MEAN resorts to E(3)-equivariant message passing along with
a proposed attention mechanism to better capture the geometrical correlation
between different components. Finally, it outputs both the 1D sequences and 3D
structure via a multi-round progressive full-shot scheme, which enjoys more
efficiency and precision against previous autoregressive approaches. Our method
significantly surpasses state-of-the-art models in sequence and structure

semantic segmentation that focuses on transferring semantic knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Existing self-training
methods typically require multiple rounds of training, while another popular
framework based on adversarial training is known to be sensitive to
hyper-parameters. In this paper, we present an easy-to-train framework that
learns domain-invariant prototypes for domain adaptive semantic segmentation.
In particular, we show that domain adaptation shares a common character with
few-shot learning in that both aim to recognize some types of unseen data with
knowledge learned from large amounts of seen data. Thus, we propose a unified
framework for domain adaptation and few-shot learning. The core idea is to use
the class prototypes extracted from few-shot annotated target images to
classify pixels of both source images and target images. Our method involves
only one-stage training and does not need to be trained on large-scale
un-annotated target images. Moreover, our method can be extended to variants of
both domain adaptation and few-shot learning. Experiments on adapting

black hole (BH) gravity cannot resist the radiation force. We derive the mass
loss rate in the outflows by solving a dynamical equation for the vertical gas
motion in the disk. The structure of a supercritical accretion disk is
calculated with the radial energy advection included. We find that most
inflowing gas is driven into outflows if the disk is accreting at a moderate
Eddington-scaled rate (up to $\sim 100$) at its outer edge, i.e., only a small
fraction of gas is accreted by the BH, which is radiating at several Eddington
luminosities, while it reaches around ten for extremely high accretion rate
cases ($\dot{m}\equiv\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}\sim 1000$). Compared with a
normal slim disk, the disk luminosity is substantially suppressed due to the
mass loss in the outflows. We apply the model to the light curves of the tidal
disruption events (TDEs), and find that the disk luminosity declines very
slowly with time even if a typical accretion rate $\dot{m}\propto t^{-5/3}$ is
assumed at the outer edge of the disk, which is qualitatively consistent with
the observed light curves in some TDEs, and helps understanding the energy
deficient phenomenon observed in the TDEs. Strong outflows from supercritical
accretion disks surrounding super massive BHs may play crucial roles on their

Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT) using spectroscopic data. The latter employs
the magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence's anisotropy to probe the magnetic
fields. Being applied to the CO (2-1) and H$\alpha$ emission lines obtained
from the PHANGS-ALMA and PHANGS-MUSE surveys, it reveals the magnetic field
orientation globally consistent with the polarization. The agreement of the
VGT-CO and polarization suggests that the magnetic fields associated with
synchrotron emission also percolate through star-forming regions. The
VGT-H$\alpha$ measurement reveals the magnetic fields in the warm ionized
medium that permeates the disk and disk's vicinity so that it exhibits less
agreement with polarization. We find prominent radial fields measured by
synchrotron polarization appear in the transition regions from the spiral arms
to the galactic bar, while such morphology is less apparent in the VGT-CO and
VGT-H$\alpha$ measured magnetic fields. The radial fields suggest that the
magnetic torque is important in removing orbiting gas' angular momentum. We
notice that magnetic fields inferred from the dust polarization, VGT-CO, and

hierarchy of grouped flows into a flat structure for flat scheduling while
dove-tailing H-DRFQ iteratively performs flat scheduling to sibling nodes on

research attention due to that the training process is auditable and the
architecture is serverless avoiding the single point failure of the parameter
server in vanilla federated learning (VFL). Nevertheless, BFL tremendously
escalates the communication traffic volume because all local model updates
(i.e., changes of model parameters) obtained by BFL clients will be transmitted
to all miners for verification and to all clients for aggregation. In contrast,
the parameter server and clients in VFL only retain aggregated model updates.
Consequently, the huge communication traffic in BFL will inevitably impair the
training efficiency and hinder the deployment of BFL in reality. To improve the
practicality of BFL, we are among the first to propose a fast blockchain-based
communication-efficient federated learning framework by compressing
communications in BFL, called BCFL. Meanwhile, we derive the convergence rate
of BCFL with non-convex loss. To maximize the final model accuracy, we further
formulate the problem to minimize the training loss of the convergence rate
subject to a limited training time with respect to the compression rate and the
block generation rate, which is a bi-convex optimization problem and can be
efficiently solved. To the end, to demonstrate the efficiency of BCFL, we carry
out extensive experiments with standard CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets. Our
experimental results not only verify the correctness of our analysis, but also
manifest that BCFL can remarkably reduce the communication traffic by 95-98% or
shorten the training time by 90-95% compared with BFL.

difficult to construct a TBI segmentation model as manually annotated MR scans

applied to alleviate the issue of data scarcity. However, conventional data
augmentation strategies such as spatial and intensity transformation are unable
to mimic the deformation and lesions in traumatic brains, which limits the
performance of the subsequent segmentation task. To address these issues, we
propose a novel medical image inpainting model named TBI-GAN to synthesize TBI
MR scans with paired brain label maps. The main strength of our TBI-GAN method
is that it can generate TBI images and corresponding label maps simultaneously,

to fully explore the target-domain information from the views of boundaries and

  First, we propose a novel mix-up strategy to generate high-quality

source-domain boundaries in previous works, we select the high-confidence
target-domain areas and then paste them to the source-domain images. Such a
strategy can generate the object boundaries in target domain (edge of
target-domain object areas) with the correct labels. Consequently, the boundary
information of target domain can be effectively captured by learning on the
mixed-up samples.
  Second, we design a multi-level contrastive loss to improve the
representation of target-domain data, including pixel-level and prototype-level
contrastive learning.

on optimizing DNN training for faster completion, often without considering the
impact on energy efficiency.
  In this paper, we observe that common practices to improve training
performance can often lead to inefficient energy usage. More importantly, we
demonstrate that there is a tradeoff between energy consumption and performance
optimization. To this end, we propose Zeus, an optimization framework to
navigate this tradeoff by automatically finding optimal job- and GPU-level
configurations for recurring DNN training jobs. Zeus uses an online
exploration-exploitation approach in conjunction with just-in-time energy
profiling, averting the need for expensive offline measurements, while adapting
to data drifts over time. Our evaluation shows that Zeus can improve the energy
efficiency of DNN training by 15.3%-75.8% for diverse workloads.

prevalence of smart devices and the demand for real-time analytics.
Geo-distributed streaming systems, where cloud-based queries utilize data
streams from multiple distributed devices, face challenges since wide-area
network (WAN) bandwidth is often scarce or expensive. Edge computing allows us
to address these bandwidth costs by utilizing resources close to the devices,
e.g. to perform sampling over the incoming data streams, which trades
downstream query accuracy to reduce the overall transmission cost. In this
paper, we leverage the fact that correlations between data streams may exist
across devices located in the same geographical region. Using this insight, we
develop a hybrid edge-cloud system which systematically trades off between
sampling at the edge and estimation of missing values in the cloud to reduce
traffic over the WAN. We present an optimization framework which computes
sample sizes at the edge and systematically bounds the number of samples we can
estimate in the cloud given the strength of the correlation between streams.
Our evaluation with three real-world datasets shows that compared to existing
sampling techniques, our system could provide comparable error rates over
multiple aggregate queries while reducing WAN traffic by 27-42%.

low-cost, portable device that can take microscopic images and automatically
detect malaria parasites with embedded AI. The device has two subsystems. The
first subsystem is an on-device multi-layered deep learning network, that
detects red blood cells (RBCs) from microscopic images, followed by a malaria
parasite classifier that recognizes malaria parasites in the individual RBCs.
The testing and validation demonstrated a high average accuracy of 89.9% for

TensorFlow Lite while addressing limited storage and computational capacity.
This system also has cloud synchronization, which sends images to the cloud
when connected to the Internet for analysis and model improvement purposes. The
second subsystem is the hardware which consists of components like Raspberry
Pi, a camera, a touch screen display, and an innovative low-cost bead
microscope. Evaluation of the bead microscope demonstrated similar image
quality with that of expensive light microscopes. The device is designed to be
portable and work in remote environments without the Internet or power. The
solution is extensible to other diseases requiring microscopy and can help
standardize automation of disease diagnosis in rural parts of developing

HNNs do not require numerical gradients of the target density during sampling.
Moreover, they satisfy important properties such as perfect time reversibility
and Hamiltonian conservation, making them well-suited for use within HMC and
NUTS because stationarity can be shown. We also propose an HNN extension called

Compared to HNNs, L-HNNs offer improved expressivity and reduced integration
errors. Finally, we employ L-HNNs in NUTS with an online error monitoring
scheme to prevent sample degeneracy in regions of low probability density. We
demonstrate L-HNNs in NUTS with online error monitoring on several examples
involving complex, heavy-tailed, and high-local-curvature probability
densities. Overall, L-HNNs in NUTS with online error monitoring satisfactorily
inferred these probability densities. Compared to traditional NUTS, L-HNNs in
NUTS with online error monitoring required 1--2 orders of magnitude fewer
numerical gradients of the target density and improved the effective sample
size (ESS) per gradient by an order of magnitude.

predict thermal electrokinetics in electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) by
using an energetic variational approach. The least action principle and maximum
dissipation principle from the non-equilibrium thermodynamics are employed to
develop modified Nernst-Planck equations for non-isothermal ion transport with
temperature inhomogeneity. Laws of thermodynamics are employed to derive a
temperature evolution equation with heat sources due to thermal pressure and
electrostatic interactions. Numerical simulations successfully predict
temperature oscillation in the charging-discharging processes of EDLCs,
indicating that the developed model is able to capture reversible and
irreversible heat generations. The impact of ionic sizes and scan rate of
surface potential on ion transport, heat generation, and charge current is
systematically assessed in cyclic voltammetry simulations. It is found that the
thermal electrokinetics in EDLCs cannot follow the surface potential with fast
scan rates, showing delayed dynamics with hysteresis diagrams. Our work thus
provides a useful tool for physics-based prediction of thermal electrokinetics
in EDLCs.

logarithmic energy potentials has always been the essential difficulty to
design a second order accurate scheme in time, while preserving the variational
energetic structures. The mobility function is updated with a second order
accurate extrapolation formula, for the sake of unique solvability. A modified
Crank-Nicolson scheme is used to approximate the logarithmic term, so that its
inner product with the discrete temporal derivative exactly gives the
corresponding nonlinear energy difference; henceforth the energy stability is
ensured for the logarithmic part. In addition, nonlinear artificial
regularization terms are added in the numerical scheme, so that the
positivity-preserving property could be theoretically proved, with the help of
the singularity associated with the logarithmic function. Furthermore, an
optimal rate convergence analysis is provided in this paper, in which the
higher order asymptotic expansion for the numerical solution, the rough error
estimate and refined error estimate techniques have to be included to
accomplish such an analysis. This work combines the following theoretical
properties for a second order accurate numerical scheme for the PNP system: (i)
second order accuracy in both time and space, (ii) unique solvability and

stacking many GNPs can elaborately manipulate the amplitudes and phases of left

absorption with a negative cross section, does not fit this method, however.
Aims: We explore alterations to the standard photon packet life cycle in Monte
Carlo radiative transfer that allow the treatment of net stimulated emission
without loss of generality or efficiency. Methods: We present the explicit
absorption technique that allows net stimulated emission to be handled
efficiently. It uses the scattering rather than the extinction optical depth

Our special-purpose code is capable of recovering the analytical solutions to
the two-stream problem in all regimes, including the one of strong net
stimulated emission. The implementation in SKIRT is straightforward, as the
explicit absorption technique easily combines with the variance reduction and

second-order nonlinear dynamic equation by utilizing voltage pulse driven
ion-gating in a LixWO3 channel to enable reservoir computing. Under the normal

states, the lowest prediction error is 7.39x10-4. Performance was enhanced by
the addition of IG to the reservoir states, resulting in a significant lowering
of the prediction error to 5.06x10-4, which is noticeably lower than other
types of physical reservoirs reported to date. A second-order nonlinear
autoregressive moving average (NARMA2) task, a typical benchmark of reservoir
computing, was also performed with the IGR and good performance was achieved,
with an NMSE of 0.163. A short-term memory task was performed to investigate an
enhancement mechanism resulting from the IG addition. An increase in memory
capacity, from 1.87 without IG to 2.73 with IG, was observed in the forgetting

prevalent in various domains, including bibliographic networks, social media,
and knowledge graphs. As a fundamental task in analyzing heterogeneous graphs,
relevance measure aims to calculate the relevance between two objects of
different types, which has been used in many applications such as web search,
recommendation, and community detection. Most of existing relevance measures
focus on homogeneous networks where objects are of the same type, and a few
measures are developed for heterogeneous graphs, but they often need the
pre-defined meta-path. Defining meaningful meta-paths requires much domain
knowledge, which largely limits their applications, especially on schema-rich
heterogeneous graphs like knowledge graphs. Recently, the Graph Neural Network
(GNN) has been widely applied in many graph mining tasks, but it has not been
applied for measuring relevance yet. To address the aforementioned problems, we
propose a novel GNN-based relevance measure, namely GSim. Specifically, we
first theoretically analyze and show that GNN is effective for measuring the
relevance of nodes in the graph. We then propose a context path-based graph
neural network (CP-GNN) to automatically leverage the semantics in
heterogeneous graphs. Moreover, we exploit CP-GNN to support relevance measures
between two objects of any type. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GSim
outperforms existing measures.

One method of
quantifying the structure of time series is by calculating a set of summary
statistics or `features', and then representing a time series in terms of its
properties as a feature vector. The resulting feature space is interpretable
and informative, and enables conventional statistical learning approaches,
including clustering, regression, and classification, to be applied to
time-series datasets. Many open-source software packages for computing sets of
time-series features exist across multiple programming languages, including
catch22 (22 features: Matlab, R, Python, Julia), feasts (42 features: R),
tsfeatures (63 features: R), Kats (40 features: Python), tsfresh (779 features:
Python), and TSFEL (390 features: Python). However, there are several issues:
(i) a singular access point to these packages is not currently available; (ii)
to access all feature sets, users must be fluent in multiple languages; and
(iii) these feature-extraction packages lack extensive accompanying
methodological pipelines for performing feature-based time-series analysis,
such as applications to time-series classification. Here we introduce a
solution to these issues in an R software package called theft: Tools for
Handling Extraction of Features from Time series. theft is a unified and

function by decomposing it into the sum of main and interaction components of
arbitrary order. We propose a new identification constraint that allows for the
extraction of interventional SHAP values and partial dependence plots, thereby
unifying local and global explanations. With our proposed identification, a
feature's partial dependence plot corresponds to the main effect term plus the
intercept. The interventional SHAP value of feature $k$ is a weighted sum of
the main component and all interaction components that include $k$, with the
weights given by the reciprocal of the component's dimension. This brings a new
perspective to local explanations such as SHAP values which were previously
motivated by game theory only. We show that the decomposition can be used to
reduce direct and indirect bias by removing all components that include a
protected feature. Lastly, we motivate a new measure of feature importance. In
principle, our proposed functional decomposition can be applied to any machine
learning model, but exact calculation is only feasible for low-dimensional

interface has been designed to avoid distractions while driving because it
operates automatically and independently of the driver, through voice prompts.

without increasing the price of vehicles and without requiring the integration
of new devices neither in vehicles nor on roads. The only prerequisite is to

J0554+3107 allowed us, for the first time, firmly identify it in X-rays by
detection of pulsations with the pulsar period. In the 0.2-2 keV band, the
pulse profile shows two peaks separated by about a half of the rotation phase
with the pulsed fraction of $25 \pm 6$ per cent. The profile and spectrum in
this band can be mainly described by thermal emission from the neutron star
with the hydrogen atmosphere, dipole magnetic field of $\sim 10^{13}$ G and
non-uniform surface temperature. Non-thermal emission from the pulsar
magnetosphere is marginally detected at higher photon energies. The spectral
fit with the atmosphere+power law model implies that J0554+3107 is a rather
heavy and cool neutron star with the mass of 1.6-2.1 $M_\odot$, the radius of
$\approx 13$ km and the redshifted effective temperature of $\approx 50$ eV.
The spectrum shows an absorption line of unknown nature at $\approx 350$ eV.
Given the extinction-distance relation, the pulsar is located at $\approx 2$
kpc and has the redshifted bolometric thermal luminosity of $\approx 2 \times
10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We discuss cooling scenarios for J0554+3107 considering
plausible equations of state of super-dense matter inside the star, different
compositions of the heat-blanketing envelope and various ages.

the cross-modality semantic consistency between the input text and the
synthesized image. Typical methods, which seek to model the text-to-image
mapping directly, could only capture keywords in the text that indicates common
objects or actions but fail to learn their spatial distribution patterns. An
effective way to circumvent this limitation is to generate an image layout as
guidance, which is attempted by a few methods. Nevertheless, these methods fail
to generate practically effective layouts due to the diversity of input text
and object location. In this paper we push for effective modeling in both
text-to-layout generation and layout-to-image synthesis. Specifically, we
formulate the text-to-layout generation as a sequence-to-sequence modeling
task, and build our model upon Transformer to learn the spatial relationships
between objects by modeling the sequential dependencies between them. In the
stage of layout-to-image synthesis, we focus on learning the textual-visual
semantic alignment per object in the layout to precisely incorporate the input
text into the layout-to-image synthesizing process. To evaluate the quality of
generated layout, we design a new metric specifically, dubbed Layout Quality
Score, which considers both the absolute distribution errors of bounding boxes
in the layout and the mutual spatial relationships between them. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our
method over state-of-the-art methods on both predicting the layout and
synthesizing the image from the given text.

training data from exchanged gradient information. To defend against such
attacks, a variety of defense mechanisms were proposed. However, they usually
lead to an unacceptable trade-off between privacy and model utility. Recent
observations suggest that dropout could mitigate gradient leakage and improve
model utility if added to neural networks. Unfortunately, this phenomenon has
not been systematically researched yet. In this work, we thoroughly analyze the
effect of dropout on iterative gradient inversion attacks. We find that state
of the art attacks are not able to reconstruct the client data due to the
stochasticity induced by dropout during model training. Nonetheless, we argue
that dropout does not offer reliable protection if the dropout induced
stochasticity is adequately modeled during attack optimization. Consequently,
we propose a novel Dropout Inversion Attack (DIA) that jointly optimizes for
client data and dropout masks to approximate the stochastic client model. We
conduct an extensive systematic evaluation of our attack on four seminal model
architectures and three image classification datasets of increasing complexity.
We find that our proposed attack bypasses the protection seemingly induced by
dropout and reconstructs client data with high fidelity. Our work demonstrates
that privacy inducing changes to model architectures alone cannot be assumed to
reliably protect from gradient leakage and therefore should be combined with
complementary defense mechanisms.

remains the dominating approach for click-through rate prediction. It can be
attributed to the calibration ability of the pointwise loss since the
prediction can be viewed as the click probability. In practice, a CTR
prediction model is also commonly assessed with the ranking ability. To
optimize the ranking ability, ranking loss (e.g., pairwise or listwise loss)
can be adopted as they usually achieve better rankings than pointwise loss.
Previous studies have experimented with a direct combination of the two losses
to obtain the benefit from both losses and observed an improved performance.
However, previous studies break the meaning of output logit as the
click-through rate, which may lead to sub-optimal solutions. To address this
issue, we propose an approach that can Jointly optimize the Ranking and
Calibration abilities (JRC for short). JRC improves the ranking ability by
contrasting the logit value for the sample with different labels and constrains
the predicted probability to be a function of the logit subtraction. We further
show that JRC consolidates the interpretation of logits, where the logits model
the joint distribution. With such an interpretation, we prove that JRC
approximately optimizes the contextualized hybrid discriminative-generative
objective. Experiments on public and industrial datasets and online A/B testing
show that our approach improves both ranking and calibration abilities. Since
May 2022, JRC has been deployed on the display advertising platform of Alibaba

chess-board of size $n\times n\times n$ with at most $n^2$ non-attacking rooks.
In Latin squares, a subsystem and its most distant mate together have as many
rooks as their capacity. That implies a simple capacity condition for the
completion of partial Latin squares which is in fact the Cruse's necessary
condition for characteristic matrices. Andersen-Hilton proved that, except for
certain listed cases, a PLS of order $n$ can be completed if it contains only
$n$ symbols. Andersen proved it for $n+1$ symbols, listing the cases to be
excluded. Identifying the structures of the chess-board that can be overloaded
with $n$ or $n+1$ rooks, it follows that a PLS derived from a chess-board with
at most $n+1$ non-attacking rooks can be completed exactly if it satisfies the
capacity condition. In a layer of a Latin square, two subsystems of a remote
couple are in balance. Thus, a necessary condition for completion of a layer
can be formulated, the balance condition. For an LSC, each 1-dimensional
subspace of the chess-board contains exactly one rook. Consequently, for the

particles with complex shapes and rarefied gas flows is rapidly rising in
different practical applications such as aerospace industry and semiconductor
manufacturing. The transport of particles in these conditions is often modelled
via an Euler-Lagrangian Point-Particles approach, where rarefaction effects are
included through the phenomenological Cunningham corrections on the drag force
experienced by the particles. In Point-Particles approaches, any explicit
relation to the finite size of the particles, shape, orientation and momentum
accommodation coefficient is typically neglected. In this work we aim to cover
this gap by deriving, from fully-resolved DSMC simulations, heuristic models
for the drag force acting on ellipsoidal particles with different aspect
ratios. We include in the models the capability to predict effects related to
gas-surface interactions via the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient
(TMAC). The derived models can be used as corrections (to include shape,
orientation and TMAC effects) in standard Euler-Lagrangian Point Particles
simulations in rarefied gas flows. Additionally, we show that the obtained drag
corrections, formally valid for unbounded gas flows, can potentially be applied
also in cases where the particle moves in proximity to a solid wall. We do so
by investigating near-wall effects on the drag of a prolate ellipsoidal
particle. Due to confinement effects, the drag increases when compared to the
unbounded case, but such effects are typically negligible for large $Kn$ also
in cases in which the particle is in contact with the solid wall.

learning. Due to the decentralized feature of FL, it is vulnerable to
adversarial attacks in the training procedure, e.g. , backdoor attacks. A
backdoor attack aims to inject a backdoor into the machine learning model such
that the model will make arbitrarily incorrect behavior on the test sample with
some specific backdoor trigger. Even though a range of backdoor attack methods
of FL has been introduced, there are also methods defending against them. Many
of the defending methods utilize the abnormal characteristics of the models
with backdoor or the difference between the models with backdoor and the
regular models. To bypass these defenses, we need to reduce the difference and
the abnormal characteristics. We find a source of such abnormality is that
backdoor attack would directly flip the label of data when poisoning the data.
However, current studies of the backdoor attack in FL are not mainly focus on
reducing the difference between the models with backdoor and the regular
models. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Knowledge Distillation(ADVKD), a
method combine knowledge distillation with backdoor attack in FL. With
knowledge distillation, we can reduce the abnormal characteristics in model
result from the label flipping, thus the model can bypass the defenses.
Compared to current methods, we show that ADVKD can not only reach a higher
attack success rate, but also successfully bypass the defenses when other
methods fails. To further explore the performance of ADVKD, we test how the
parameters affect the performance of ADVKD under different scenarios. According
to the experiment result, we summarize how to adjust the parameter for better
performance under different scenarios. We also use several methods to visualize
the effect of different attack and explain the effectiveness of ADVKD.

based on a textual description. The biggest challenge of this task is the fi
ne-grained video-text semantics of make-up steps. However, current methods
mainly extract video features using action-based pre-trained models. As actions
are more coarse-grained than make-up steps, action-based features are not
sufficient to provide fi ne-grained cues. To address this issue,we propose to
achieve fi ne-grained representation via exploiting feature diversities.
Specifically, we proposed a series of methods from feature extraction, network
optimization, to model ensemble. As a result, we achieved 3rd place in the MTVG
competition.

that JWST can observe $\ge 70-90\%$ (for SHARK and FLARES respectively) of
galaxies up to $z\sim10$ (down to stellar masses of $\approx 10^{8.3}\,\rm
M_{\odot}$ and SFRs of $\approx 10^{0.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}\, yr^{-1}$) in modest
integration times and given current proposed survey areas (e.g. the Web COSMOS
$0.6\,\rm deg^2$) to accurately constrain the parameters of the SFS. Although
both simulations predict qualitatively similar distributions of stellar mass
and SFR, there are important quantitative differences, such as the abundance of
massive, star-forming galaxies, with FLARES predicting a higher abundance than
SHARK; the early onset of quenching as a result of black hole growth in FLARES
(at $z\approx 8$), not seen in SHARK until much lower redshifts; and the
implementation of synthetic photometry, with FLARES predicting more
JWST-detected galaxies ($\sim 90\%$) than SHARK ($\sim 70\%$) at $z=10$. JWST
observations will distinguish between these models, leading to a significant
improvement upon our understanding of the formation of the very first galaxies.

using a previously collected static dataset, is an important paradigm of RL.
Standard RL methods often perform poorly in this regime due to the function
approximation errors on out-of-distribution actions. While a variety of
regularization methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, they are
often constrained by policy classes with limited expressiveness that can lead
to highly suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose representing the
policy as a diffusion model, a recent class of highly-expressive deep
generative models. We introduce Diffusion Q-learning (Diffusion-QL) that
utilizes a conditional diffusion model to represent the policy. In our
approach, we learn an action-value function and we add a term maximizing
action-values into the training loss of the conditional diffusion model, which
results in a loss that seeks optimal actions that are near the behavior policy.
We show the expressiveness of the diffusion model-based policy, and the
coupling of the behavior cloning and policy improvement under the diffusion
model both contribute to the outstanding performance of Diffusion-QL. We
illustrate the superiority of our method compared to prior works in a simple 2D
bandit example with a multimodal behavior policy. We then show that our method
can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the majority of the D4RL benchmark

One candidate is quantum perceptrons designed to emulate the nonlinear

(SQPs) inherit the universal approximation property that guarantees that
classical neural networks can approximate any function. However, this does not
guarantee that QNNs built from SQPs will have any quantum advantage over their
classical counterparts. Here we critically investigate both the capabilities

effective capacity, as well as examining their performance on real learning
problems. The results are compared to those obtained for other candidate

presentation of the techniques developed for synchronizing dynamical systems in
the special case of synchronizing shift spaces. Following work of Thomsen, we
give a construction of the homoclinic and heteroclinic $C^\ast$-algebras of a
shift space in terms of Bratteli diagrams. Lastly we present several specific
examples which demonstrate these techniques. For the even shift we give a
complete computation of all the associated invariants. We also present an
example of a strictly non-sofic synchronizing shift. In particular we discuss
the rank of the $K$-theory of the homoclinic algebra of a shift space and its

a synchronizing shift whose set of non-synchronizing points is exactly the

distribution functions have been argued to be incompatible within the framework
of Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. As an alternative, so-called generalized entropies
were proposed and intensively studied. Here we show that this incompatibility
is a misconception. For a broad class of processes, Boltzmann entropy the log
multiplicity remains the valid entropy concept, however, for non-i.i.d.,
non-multinomial, and non-ergodic processes, Boltzmann entropy is not of Shannon
form. The correct form of Boltzmann entropy can be shown to be identical with
generalized entropies. We derive this result for all processes that can be
mapped reversibly to adjoint representations where processes are i.i.d.. In
these representations the information production is given by the Shannon
entropy. We proof that over the original sampling space this yields functionals
that are identical to generalized entropies. The problem of constructing
adequate context-sensitive entropy functionals therefore can be translated into
the much simpler problem of finding adjoint representations. The method
provides a comprehensive framework for a statistical physics of strongly
correlated systems and complex processes.

us to face challenges in the reverberation mapping (RM) measurement of AD sizes
in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using interband continuum delays. We examine
the effect of LSST cadence strategies on AD RM using our metric
AGNTimeLagMetric. It accounts for redshift, cadence, the magnitude limit, and
magnitude corrections for dust extinction. Running our metric on different LSST
cadence strategies, we produce an atlas of the performance estimations for LSST
photometric RM measurements. We provide an upper limit on the estimated number
of quasars for which the AD time lag can be computed within 0<z<7 using the
features of our metric. We forecast that the total counts of such objects will
increase as the mean sampling rate of the survey decreases. The AD time lag
measurements are expected for >1000 sources in each Deep Drilling field (DDF,
10 sq. deg) in any filter, with the redshift distribution of these sources
peaking at z~1. We find the LSST observation strategies with a good cadence (~
5 days) and a long cumulative season (~9 yr), as proposed for LSST DDF, are
favored for the AD size measurement. We create synthetic LSST light curves for
the most suitable DDF cadences and determine RM time lags to demonstrate the
impact of the best cadences based on the proposed metric.

some physical parameters of the occulting object. The result depends on the
photometric accuracy, the temporal resolution, and the number of chords
obtained. Space telescopes can achieve high photometric accuracy as they are
not affected by atmospheric scintillation. Using ESA's CHEOPS space telescope,
we observed a stellar occultation by the Transneptunian object (50000) Quaoar.
We compare the obtained chord with previous occultations by this object and
determine its astrometry with sub-milliarcsecond precision. Also, we determine
upper limits to the presence of a global methane atmosphere on the occulting
body. We predicted and observed a stellar occultation by Quaoar using the
CHEOPS space telescope. We measured the occultation light curve from this
data-set and determined the dis- and re-appearance of the star behind the
occulting body. Furthermore, a ground-based telescope in Australia was used to
constrain Quaoar's limb. Combined with results from previous works, these
measurements allow us to obtain a precise position of Quaoar at the occultation
time. We present results obtained from the first stellar occultation by a
Transneptunian object (TNO) using space telescope orbiting Earth. It was the
occultation by Quaoar observed on 2020 June 11. We used the CHEOPS light curve
to obtain a surface pressure upper limit of 85 nbar for the detection of a
global methane atmosphere. Also, combining this observation with a ground-based
observation we fit Quaoar's limb to determine its astrometric position with an
uncertainty below 1.0 mas. This observation is a first of its kind, and it
shall be considered as a proof of concept of stellar occultation observations
of Transneptunian objects with space telescopes orbiting Earth. Moreover, it
shows significant prospects for the James Webb Space Telescope.

age. We conducted dedicated observations of (458271) 2010 UM26 and 2010 RN221
in summer 2022 that resulted in a high-accuracy astrometric set of data.
Joining them with the previously available observations, we improved the
precision of the orbit determination of both asteroids. We used numerical
simulations backward in time to constrain the origin of this new pair by
observing orbital convergence in the Cartesian space. Using a large number of
possible clone variants of (458271) 2010 UM26 and 2010 RN221 we find they all
converge in a narrow time interval around March 2003 having extremely tight
minimum distances ($\leq 1000$ km) and minimum relative velocities ($\leq 3$
cm~s$^{-1}$). These conditions require to include mutual gravitational
attraction of the asteroids constituting the pair for its age determination.
Extending our model by this effect even improves the convergence results. We
find there is more than $55$\% probability that the pair formed after the year
2000. However, quasi-satellite captures make the possible age uncertainty of
this pair prolonged possibly to the 1960s. Still, this is by far the youngest
known asteroid pair, a prime target for future astronomical observations.

quasilinear magnetoresistance (MR) behavior is observed in CaAuAs. On the other
hand, MR of the doped compound shows a pronounced cusplike feature in the
low-field regime. Such behavior of MR in CaAu$_{0.5}$Cu$_{0.5}$As is attributed
to the weak antilocalization (WAL) effect. The WAL effect is analyzed using
different theoretical models, including the semiclassical $\sim\sqrt{B}$ one
which accounts for the three-dimensional WAL and modified Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka
model. Strong WAL effect is also observed in the longitudinal MR, which is well
described by the generalized Altshuler-Aronov model. Our study suggests that
the WAL effect originates from weak disorder and the spin-orbit coupled bulk
state. Interestingly, we have also observed the signature of chiral anomaly in
longitudinal MR, when both current and field are applied along the $c$ axis.
The Hall resistivity measurements indicate that the charge conduction mechanism
in these compounds is dominated by the holes with a concentration
$\sim$10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ and mobility $\sim 10^2$ cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ S$^{-1}$.

several reasons, it might be convenient to analyze just a subset of the data.
The application of the D-optimality criterion can be helpful to optimally
select a subsample of observations. However, it is well known that D-optimal
support points lie on the boundary of the design space and if they go hand in
hand with extreme response values, they can have a severe influence on the
estimated linear model (leverage points with high influence). To overcome this
problem, firstly, we propose an unsupervised exchange procedure that enables us
to select a nearly D-optimal subset of observations without high leverage
values. Then, we provide a supervised version of this exchange procedure, where
besides high leverage points also the outliers in the responses (that are not
associated to high leverage points) are avoided. This is possible because,
unlike other design situations, in subsampling from big datasets the response
values may be available.
  Finally, both the unsupervised and the supervised selection procedures are
generalized to I-optimality, with the goal of getting accurate predictions.

amount of attention to their real-world robustness, i.e., whether a DNN resists
black-box adversarial attacks, among them score-based query attacks (SQAs) are
the most threatening ones because of their practicalities and effectiveness:
the attackers only need dozens of queries on model outputs to seriously hurt a
victim network. Defending against SQAs requires a slight but artful variation
of outputs due to the service purpose for users, who share the same output
information with attackers. In this paper, we propose a real-world defense,
called Unifying Gradients (UniG), to unify gradients of different data so that
attackers could only probe a much weaker attack direction that is similar for
different samples. Since such universal attack perturbations have been
validated as less aggressive than the input-specific perturbations, UniG
protects real-world DNNs by indicating attackers a twisted and less informative
attack direction. To enhance UniG's practical significance in real-world
applications, we implement it as a Hadamard product module that is
computationally-efficient and readily plugged into any model. According to
extensive experiments on 5 SQAs and 4 defense baselines, UniG significantly
improves real-world robustness without hurting clean accuracy on CIFAR10 and
ImageNet. For instance, UniG maintains a CIFAR-10 model of 77.80% accuracy
under 2500-query Square attack while the state-of-the-art adversarially-trained
model only has 67.34% on CIFAR10. Simultaneously, UniG greatly surpasses all
compared baselines in clean accuracy and the modification degree of outputs.

possession of certain secret without revealing anything about it, which allows
non-encrypted communication during authentication. Thanks to the combination of
the aforementioned tools, the cooperation among vehicles can be used for

suitable for the study of valuations of higher rank on function fields of

quasi-monomial valuations taking values in the lexicographically ordered group
R^k.
  We prove a duality theorem that gives a geometric realization of higher rank
quasi-monomial valuations as tangent cones of dual cone complexes. Using this
duality, we provide an analytic description of quasi-monomial valuations as
multi-directional derivative operators on tropical functions.
  We consider moreover a refined notion of tropicalization in which we remember
the initial terms of power series on each cone of a dual complex, and prove a
tropical analogue of the weak approximation theorem in number theory by showing
that any compatible collection of initial terms on cones of a dual cone complex
is the refined tropicalization of a rational function in the function field of
the variety.
  Endowing the value group R^k with its Euclidean topology, we study then a
natural topology on spaces of higher rank valuations that we call the tropical
topology. By using the approximation theorem we provide an explicit description
of the tropical topology on tangent cones of dual cone complexes.
  Finally, we show that tangent cones of dual complexes provide a notion of
skeleton in higher rank non-archimedean geometry. That is, generalizing the
picture in rank one to higher rank, we construct retraction maps to tangent
cones of dual cone complexes, and use them to obtain limit formulae in which we
reconstruct higher rank non-archimedian spaces with their tropical topology as
the projective limit of their higher rank skeleta.
  We conjecture that these higher rank skeleta provide appropriate bases for
the study of variations of Newton-Okounkov bodies.

each flow variable of interest, and artificial neural networks are used to map
the model parameters to the model's inputs. Surrogate models were also
developed to predict surface quantities of interest for the case of nonreacting

limited success. Here, we make use of a high-accuracy numerical solution scheme
to extensively explore the space of possible prolate solutions and extract

behavior of one class, referred to as ""normal"", is in agreement with the
leading-order behavior derived analytically in prior work. The second class of
solutions was not previously predicted, but solutions in this class are
responsible for unexplained behavior seen in previous numerical prolate
solutions during the transition to asymptotic behavior. The behavior of
solutions in this ""anomalous"" class is more complicated than that of solutions
in the normal class, with the anomalous class separating into different types
based on the behavior of the eigenvalues at different asymptotic orders. We
explore the question of when anomalous solutions appear and find necessary, but

learning focuses on learning policies with suitable performance from

either directly mimicking the behavior policy of an expert (behavior cloning)

effect uses the idea of the total variation of a function integrated with
probability theory. The probabilistic part is the natural availability of
changing an exposure values given some variables. These variables interfere
with the effect of the exposure on a given outcome. PACE has a parameter $d$
determining the degree of considering the natural availability of changing the

cases are important. In contrast, with the higher values of $d$, our framework
deals with the problems that are in nature probabilistic. Hence, instead of a
single value for causal effect, we provide a causal effect vector by
discretizing $d$. Further, we introduce the positive and negative PACE to
measure the positive and the negative causal changes in the outcome while
changing the exposure values. Furthermore, we provide an identifiability
criterion for PACE to deal with observational studies. We also address the

the generalization capability of representation. Motivated by this, we present
a new robust contrastive learning scheme, coined R\'enyiCL, which can
effectively manage harder augmentations by utilizing R\'enyi divergence. Our

na\""ive usage of a variational method is impractical due to the large variance.

Vulcan laser facility, where two intense laser beams were overlapped in a
mirror-like configuration onto a solid target, preceded by a long preplasma. We
show that when the laser beams were close enough to each other, the generation
of hot electrons at the target front was much improved and so was the ion
acceleration at the target backside, both in terms of their maximum energy and
collimation. The underlying mechanism is pinpointed with multidimensional
particle-in-cell simulations, which demonstrate that the magnetic fields
self-induced by the electron currents driven by the two laser beams at the
target front can reconnect, thereby enhancing the production of hot electrons,
and favoring their subsequent magnetic guiding across the target. Our
simulations also reveal that the laser coupling with the target can be further
improved when overlapping more than two beamlines. This multi-beam scheme would

spectrum and a disorder smooth on the scale of the magnetic length are
essential conditions for the validity of the theory, and the linear
magnetoresistance appears in the extreme quantum limit where only the zeroth
Landau level is half filled. It is the interplay between the relativistic-like
nature of Weyl fermions and the classical dynamics of their cyclotron centers,
which leads to the linear magnetoresistance. We also derive an analogous result

counterparts to gravitational waves (GWs), gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows,
are ideal targets for observing trans-relativistic evolution of accelerated
electron distribution because the GWs spot nearby GRBs with off-axis jets,
otherwise missed in gamma-ray observations. We find that the relativistic
spectral slope begins to change steeply near the peak time of the light curve
and approaches the non-relativistic limit in about 10 times the peak time. The
trans-relativistic evolution of the afterglow synchrotron spectrum is
consistent with GRB 170817A observations within errors, and will be measurable
in similar but more distant events at a GW horizon $\sim 200$ Mpc in a denser
environment. We roughly estimate that such events represent a fraction of 10-50
per cent of the GRB 170817A-like off-axis short GRBs. We also find that the
spectral evolution does not depend on the jet structure if their light curves
are similar to each other.

valuable information for diagnosis and the determination of follow-up treatment
plan. However, accurate dental plaque segmentation is a challenging task that
requires identifying teeth and dental plaque subjected to semantic-blur regions
(i.e., confused boundaries in border regions between teeth and dental plaque)
and complex variations of instance shapes, which are not fully addressed by
existing methods. Therefore, we propose a semantic decomposition network
(SDNet) that introduces two single-task branches to separately address the
segmentation of teeth and dental plaque and designs additional constraints to
learn category-specific features for each branch, thus facilitating the
semantic decomposition and improving the performance of dental plaque
segmentation. Specifically, SDNet learns two separate segmentation branches for
teeth and dental plaque in a divide-and-conquer manner to decouple the
entangled relation between them. Each branch that specifies a category tends to
yield accurate segmentation. To help these two branches better focus on
category-specific features, two constraint modules are further proposed: 1)
contrastive constraint module (CCM) to learn discriminative feature
representations by maximizing the distance between different category
representations, so as to reduce the negative impact of semantic-blur regions
on feature extraction; 2) structural constraint module (SCM) to provide
complete structural information for dental plaque of various shapes by the
supervision of an boundary-aware geometric constraint. Besides, we construct a
large-scale open-source Stained Dental Plaque Segmentation dataset (SDPSeg),
which provides high-quality annotations for teeth and dental plaque.
Experimental results on SDPSeg datasets show SDNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

investigate the effect that CO$_2$ partial pressure (pCO$_2$) has on
exoplanets' climate variability, by analyzing results from ExoCAM model
simulations of the tidally locked TRAPPIST-1e exoplanet, an Earth-like
aqua-planet and Earth itself. First, we relate the differences between the
planets to their elementary parameters. Then, we compare the sensitivity of the
Earth analogue and TRAPPIST-1e's surface temperature and precipitation to
pCO$_2$. Our simulations suggest that the climatology and extremes of
TRAPPIST-1e's temperature are $\sim$1.5 times more sensitive to pCO$_2$
relative to Earth. The precipitation sensitivity strongly depends on the
specific region analyzed. Indeed, the precipitation near mid-latitude and
equatorial sub-stellar regions of TRAPPIST-1e is more sensitive to pCO$_2$, and
the precipitation sensitivity is $\sim$2 times larger in TRAPPIST-1e. A
dynamical systems perspective, which provides information about how the
atmosphere evolves in phase-space, provides additional insights. Notably, an
increase in pCO$_2$, results in an increase in atmospheric persistence on both
planets, and the persistence of TRAPPIST-1e is more sensitive to pCO$_2$ than
Earth. We conclude that the climate of TRAPPIST-1e may be more sensitive to
pCO$_2$, particularly on its dayside. This study documents a new pathway for

framework. It uses triple-view feature learning on a limited amount of labelled
data and a large amount of unlabeled data. The triple-view architecture
consists of three pixel-level classifiers and a low-level shared-weight
learning module. The model is first initialized with labelled data. Label
processing, including data perturbation, confidence label voting and
unconfident label detection for annotation, enables the model to train on
labelled and unlabeled data simultaneously. The confidence of each model gets
improved through the other two views of the feature learning. This process is
repeated until each model reaches the same confidence level as its
counterparts. This strategy enables triple-view learning of generic medical
image datasets. Bespoke overlap-based and boundary-based loss functions are
tailored to the different stages of the training. The segmentation results are
evaluated on four publicly available benchmark datasets including Ultrasound,
CT, MRI, and Histology images. Repeated experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed network compared against other semi-supervised

work to collect IS and IE data along grid lines covering a large target area

address the above problems, we present a novel robotic inspection system named
as Impact-Rover to automate the data collection process and introduce data
analytics software to visualize the inspection result allowing regular
non-professional people to understand. The system consists of three modules: 1)
a robotic platform with vertical mobility to collect IS and IE data in
hard-to-reach locations, 2) vision-based positioning module that fuses the
RGB-D camera, IMU and wheel encoder to estimate the 6-DOF pose of the robot, 3)
a data analytics software module for processing the IS data to generate defect
maps. The Impact-Rover hosts both IE and IS devices on a sliding mechanism and
can perform move-stop-sample operations to collect multiple IS and IE data at
adjustable spacing. The robot takes samples much faster than the manual data
collection method because it automatically takes the multiple measurements
along a straight line and records the locations. This paper focuses on
reporting experimental results on IS. We calculate features and use
unsupervised learning methods for analyzing the data. By combining the pose
generated by our vision-based localization module and the position of the head

of the meaning conveyed from source to receiver, as opposed to the accurate
recovery of transmitted symbols. In this survey, we aim to provide a
comprehensive view of the history and current state of semantic communication
and the techniques for engineering this higher level of communication. A survey
of the current literature reveals four broad approaches to engineering semantic
communication. We term the earliest of these approaches classical semantic
information, which seeks to extend information-theoretic results to include
semantic information. A second approach makes use of knowledge graphs to
achieve semantic communication, and a third utilizes the power of modern deep
learning techniques to facilitate this communication. The fourth approach
focuses on the significance of information, rather than its meaning, to achieve
efficient, goal-oriented communication. We discuss each of these four
approaches and their corresponding studies in detail, and provide some
challenges and opportunities that pertain to each approach. Finally, we
introduce a novel approach to semantic communication, which we term
context-based semantic communication. Inspired by the way in which humans
naturally communicate with one another, this context-based approach provides a
general, optimization-based design framework for semantic communication
systems. Together, this survey provides a useful guide for the design and

problems across robotics, such as Structure from Motion (SfM), Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and calibration. Typically, at their core, they
have an optimization problem whose terms only depend on a small subset of
variables. Factor graph solvers exploit the locality of problems to drastically
reduce the computational time of the Iterative Least-Squares (ILS) methodology.
Although extremely powerful, their application is usually limited to
unconstrained problems. In this paper, we model constraints over variables
within factor graphs by introducing a factor graph version of the method of
Lagrange Multipliers. We show the potential of our method by presenting a full
navigation stack based on factor graphs. Differently from standard navigation
stacks, we can model both optimal control for local planning and localization
with factor graphs, and solve the two problems using the standard ILS
methodology. We validate our approach in real-world autonomous navigation
scenarios, comparing it with the de facto standard navigation stack implemented
in ROS. Comparative experiments show that for the application at hand our
system outperforms the standard nonlinear programming solver Interior-Point
Optimizer (IPOPT) in runtime, while achieving similar solutions.

extracellular matrix (ECM), a disordered network with complex nonlinear
mechanics. Such cells can perform mechanosensation: using local force probing
they can measure and respond to their substrate's mechanical properties. It
remains unclear, however, how the mechanical complexity of the ECM at the
cellular scale impacts mechanosensation. Here, we investigate the physical
limits of mechanosensation imposed by the inherent structural disorder and
nonlinear elastic response of the ECM. Using a theoretical framework for
disordered fiber networks, we find that the extreme mechanical heterogeneity
that cells can locally sense with small probing forces is strongly reduced with
increasing force. Specifically, we predict that the accuracy of
mechanosensation dramatically improves with force, following a universal power
law insensitive to constitutive details, which we quantitatively confirm using
microrheology experiments in collagen and fibrin gels. We provide conceptual
insights into this behavior by introducing a general model for nonlinear
mechanosensation, based on the idea of an emergent nonlinear length-scale
associated with fiber buckling. This force-dependent length-scale enhances the
range over which local mechanical measurements are performed, thereby averaging
the response of a disordered network over an enlarged region. We show with an
example how a cell can use this nonlinear mechanosensation to infer the
macroscopic mechanical properties of a disordered ECM using local measurements.
Together, our results demonstrate that cells can take advantage of the inherent
nonlinearity of fibrous networks to robustly sense, control, and respond to
their mechanical environment.

transformations, on a compact atomless probability space $(X,\nu)$, with an
orbit $Gx_0$ of measure zero, contained in the support of $\nu$, and with
compact stabilizer (i.e. $G_{x_0}$ is compact) has the following property: any

traditional fork-join parallelism. They are better suited to write applications
with irregular parallelism that can present load imbalance. However, these
programming models suffer from overheads related to task creation, scheduling
and dependency management, limiting performance and scalability when tasks
become too small. At the same time, many HPC applications implement iterative
methods or multi-step simulations that create the same directed acyclic graphs
of tasks on each iteration.
  By giving application programmers a way to express that a specific loop is
creating the same task pattern on each iteration, we can create a single task
DAG once and transform it into a cyclic graph. This cyclic graph is then reused
for successive iterations, minimizing task creation and dependency management
overhead. This paper presents the taskiter, a new construct we propose for the
OmpSs-2 and OpenMP programming models, allowing the use of directed cyclic task
graphs (DCTG) to minimize runtime overheads. Moreover, we present a simple
immediate successor locality-aware heuristic that minimizes task scheduling
overhead by bypassing the runtime task scheduler.
  We evaluate the implementation of the taskiter and the immediate successor
heuristic in 8 iterative benchmarks. Using small task granularities, we obtain
an average speedup of 3.7x over the reference OmpSs-2 implementation and an
average of 5x and 7.46x speedup over the LLVM and GCC OpenMP runtimes,
respectively.

planetary mass ($4.8 \pm 1.3$ M$_{\oplus}$) and inferred bulk density
($5.6^{+1.8}_{-1.6}$ g/cm$^3$) is suggestive of a rocky core surrounded by a

layout, we use spherical voxelization for representation instead of cubic
representation. Our voxelization method could balance the reconstruction
quality of the inner scene and outer scene. In addition, we adopt the

Nash-Williams' formula states that $k = \lceil \gamma(G) \rceil$, where
$\gamma(G)$ is the maximum of ${|E_H|}/(|V_H| -1)$ over all subgraphs $(V_H,

  The Strong Nine Dragon Tree Conjecture states that if $\gamma(G) \leq k +

edge set of $G$ into $k+1$ forests such that one forest has at most $d$ edges

possible, in the sense that we cannot replace $5$-edge-connected with
$4$-edge-connected, even if we replace $\frac{5}{6}$ with any positive real

cancer detection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and

challenges, due to the complex tree-like structure of the airways. In this
technical report, we use two-stage fully convolutional networks (FCNs) to
automatically segment pulmonary airway in thoracic CT scans from multi-sites.
Specifically, we firstly adopt a 3D FCN with U-shape network architecture to
segment pulmonary airway in a coarse resolution in order to accelerate medical
image analysis pipeline. And then another one 3D FCN is trained to segment
pulmonary airway in a fine resolution. In the 2022 MICCAI Multi-site
Multi-domain Airway Tree Modeling (ATM) Challenge, the reported method was
evaluated on the public training set of 300 cases and independent private
validation set of 50 cases. The resulting Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) is
0.914 $\pm$ 0.040, False Negative Error (FNE) is 0.079 $\pm$ 0.042, and False

environment in which a single slip can lead to serious financial implications.
Accordingly, the announcements of clinical trial results tend to determine the
future course of events, hence being closely monitored by the public. In this
work, we provide statistical evidence for the result promulgation influence on
the public pharma market value. Whereas most works focus on retrospective
impact analysis, the present research aims to predict the numerical values of
announcement-induced changes in stock prices. For this purpose, we develop a
pipeline that includes a BERT-based model for extracting sentiment polarity of
announcements, a Temporal Fusion Transformer for forecasting the expected
return, a graph convolution network for capturing event relationships, and
gradient boosting for predicting the price change. The challenge of the problem
lies in inherently different patterns of responses to positive and negative
announcements, reflected in a stronger and more pronounced reaction to the
negative news. Moreover, such phenomenon as the drop in stocks after the
positive announcements affirms the counterintuitiveness of the price behavior.
Importantly, we discover two crucial factors that should be considered while
working within a predictive framework. The first factor is the drug portfolio
size of the company, indicating the greater susceptibility to an announcement
in the case of small drug diversification. The second one is the network effect
of the events related to the same company or nosology. All findings and
insights are gained on the basis of one of the biggest FDA (the Food and Drug

film-substrate thermal boundary resistance (TBR) in a single solid
heterostructure without any reference samples, showing broad applicability for
miscellaneous heterostructures with film thickness ranging from 100 nm to 10

fitted within 3D finite element simulations. To verify this method, two typical
wide bandgap semiconductor heterojunctions, i.e., GaN on SiC (#SiC) and GaN on

analysis of its ethical implications. In addressing ethics and fairness
implications, it is important to examine the whole range of ethically relevant
features rather than looking at individual agents alone. This can be
accomplished by shifting perspective to the systems in which agents are
embedded, which is encapsulated in the macro ethics of sociotechnical systems
(STS). Through the lens of macro ethics, the governance of systems - which is
where participants try to promote outcomes and norms which reflect their values
- is key. However, multiple-user social dilemmas arise in an STS when
stakeholders of the STS have different value preferences or when norms in the
STS conflict. To develop equitable governance which meets the needs of
different stakeholders, and resolve these dilemmas in satisfactory ways with a
higher goal of fairness, we need to integrate a variety of normative ethical
principles in reasoning. Normative ethical principles are understood as
operationalizable rules inferred from philosophical theories. A taxonomy of
ethical principles is thus beneficial to enable practitioners to utilise them
in reasoning.
  This work develops a taxonomy of normative ethical principles which can be
operationalized in the governance of STS. We identify an array of ethical
principles, with 25 nodes on the taxonomy tree. We describe the ways in which
each principle has previously been operationalized, and suggest how the
operationalization of principles may be applied to the macro ethics of STS. We
further explain potential difficulties that may arise with each principle. We
envision this taxonomy will facilitate the development of methodologies to
incorporate ethical principles in reasoning capacities for governing equitable

origins and destinations, to minimise overall pollution risk and account for
the detrimental impacts of congestion. We learn this policy using reinforcement
learning techniques on simulated data in different environments with varying
distributions of cyclist fitness. These findings establish that individualised
routing is effective in reducing pollution risk while cycling, improving the
net benefits of active commuting.

  Approach",,,,,"physics.ao-ph cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The objective of this paper is to employ machine learning (ML) and deep
learning (DL) techniques to obtain from input data (storm features) available
in or derived from the HURDAT2 database models capable of simulating important
hurricane properties such as landfall location and wind speed that are
consistent with historical records. In pursuit of this objective, a trajectory
model providing the storm center in terms of longitude and latitude, and
intensity models providing the central pressure and maximum 1-$min$ wind speed
at 10 $m$ elevation were created. The trajectory and intensity models are
coupled and must be advanced together, six hours at a time, as the features
that serve as inputs to the models at any given step depend on predictions at
the previous time steps. Once a synthetic storm database is generated,
properties of interest, such as the frequencies of large wind speeds may be
extracted from any part of the simulation domain. The coupling of the
trajectory and intensity models obviates the need for an intensity decay inland
of the coastline. Prediction results are compared to historical data, and the
efficacy of the storm simulation models is demonstrated for three examples: New
Orleans, Miami and Cape Hatteras.

  Operational Space Weather Forecasting",,,"10.3389/fspas.2022.897301",,"physics.space-ph astro-ph.SR cs.AI cs.LG physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Solar flare prediction is a central problem in space weather forecasting and
has captivated the attention of a wide spectrum of researchers due to recent
advances in both remote sensing as well as machine learning and deep learning
approaches. The experimental findings based on both machine and deep learning
models reveal significant performance improvements for task specific datasets.
Along with building models, the practice of deploying such models to production
environments under operational settings is a more complex and often
time-consuming process which is often not addressed directly in research
settings. We present a set of new heuristic approaches to train and deploy an
operational solar flare prediction system for $\geq$M1.0-class flares with two
prediction modes: full-disk and active region-based. In full-disk mode,
predictions are performed on full-disk line-of-sight magnetograms using deep
learning models whereas in active region-based models, predictions are issued
for each active region individually using multivariate time series data
instances. The outputs from individual active region forecasts and full-disk
predictors are combined to a final full-disk prediction result with a
meta-model. We utilized an equal weighted average ensemble of two base
learners' flare probabilities as our baseline meta learner and improved the
capabilities of our two base learners by training a logistic regression model.
The major findings of this study are: (i) We successfully coupled two
heterogeneous flare prediction models trained with different datasets and model
architecture to predict a full-disk flare probability for next 24 hours, (ii)
Our proposed ensembling model, i.e., logistic regression, improves on the
predictive performance of two base learners and the baseline meta learner
measured in terms of two widely used metrics True Skill Statistic (TSS) and
Heidke Skill core (HSS), and (iii) Our result analysis suggests that the
logistic regression-based ensemble (Meta-FP) improves on the full-disk model
(base learner) by $\sim9\%$ in terms TSS and $\sim10\%$ in terms of HSS.
Similarly, it improves on the AR-based model (base learner) by $\sim17\%$ and
$\sim20\%$ in terms of TSS and HSS respectively. Finally, when compared to the
baseline meta model, it improves on TSS by $\sim10\%$ and HSS by $\sim15\%$.

of complexity dynamics can come together in the problem of explaining the black
hole information paradox. They are neither complete, nor final, but can seem
like a new direction of research. If read as such they could prove useful to
some researchers. The basic idea is that entanglement alone cannot fully
account for the information extraction in black hole contexts. Complexity has
been proposed as an alternative but remains a vague concept. I employ
Grothendieck's point of view to expand the idea of entanglement entropy to a
categorical context in which the objects (states) and their maps are considered
together and the map space has additional topological and geometric structure
that intermingles with the object set of the category via Sieves, Sheafs, and
Toposes.

encryption system comprises two Chua circuits that are synchronised using a

transmitter, while the other of the receiver. Both circuits are tuned to
operate in a chaotic mode. The output (chaotic) signal of the first circuit
(transmitter) is digitised and then combined with the message to be encrypted,
through an XOR gate. The second Chua circuit (receiver) is used for the
decryption; the output chaotic signal of this circuit is similarly digitised
and combined with the encrypted message to retrieve the original message. Our
hardware demonstrator proves that this method can be used in order to provide
extremely lightweight real-world, chaos-based cryptographic solutions.
