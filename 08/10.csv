of galaxies. Observations have previously shown that interactions between
multiple members, including a high-speed intruder galaxy currently colliding
into the intragroup medium, have likely generated tidal debris in the form of
multiple gaseous and stellar filaments, the formation of tidal dwarfs and
intragroup-medium starbursts, as well as widespread intergalactic shocked gas.
The details and timing of the interactions/collisions remain poorly understood
because of the multiple nature. Here we report atomic hydrogen (HI)
observations in the vicinity of SQ with a smoothed sensitivity of 1$\sigma$=4.2
$\times 10^{16}\rm cm^{-2}$ per channel ($\Delta$v=20 km s$^{-1}$;
angular-resolution=4'), which are about two orders of magnitude deeper than
previous observations. The data reveal a large HI structure (linear scale ~0.6
Mpc) encompassing an extended source of size ~0.4 Mpc associated with the
debris field and a curved diffuse feature of length ~0.5 Mpc attached to the
south edge of the extended source. The diffuse feature was likely produced by
tidal interactions in early stages of SQ (>1 Gyr ago), though it is not clear
how the low density HI gas (N$_{\rm HI}\leq 10^{18}\rm cm^{-2}$) can survive
the ionization by the inter-galactic UV background on such a long time scale.
Our observations require a rethinking of gas in outer parts of galaxy groups
and demand complex modeling of different phases of the intragroup medium in
simulations of group formation.

photonics-assisted time and frequency acquisition methods are comprehensively
analyzed and the accuracy and resolution limitation in the fast sweep scenario
is broken by broadening the filter bandwidth. It is found that when the sweep
speed is very fast, the width of the generated pulse via FTTM is mainly
determined by the impulse response of the filter. In this case, appropriately
increasing the filter bandwidth can significantly reduce the pulse width, so as
to improve the measurement accuracy and resolution. FTTM-based short-time
Fourier transform (STFT) and microwave frequency measurement using the
stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) effect is demonstrated by comparing the
results with and without SBS gain spectrum broadening and the improvement of
measurement accuracy and frequency resolution is well confirmed. The frequency
measurement accuracy of the system is improved by around 25 times compared with
the former work using a similar sweep speed, while the frequency resolution of
the STFT is also much improved compared with our former results.

retrievers depend on exact matching approaches between high-dimensional
bag-of-words (BoW) representations of both the queries and the collection. As a
result, retrieval performance is restricted by semantic discrepancies and
vocabulary gaps. On the other hand, transformer-based dense retrievers
introduce significant improvements in information retrieval tasks by exploiting
low-dimensional contextualized representations of the corpus. While dense
retrievers are known for their relative effectiveness, they suffer from lower
efficiency and lack of generalization issues, when compared to sparse
retrievers. For a lightweight retrieval task, high computational resources and
time consumption are major barriers encouraging the renunciation of dense
models despite potential gains. In this work, we propose boosting the
performance of sparse retrievers by expanding both the queries and the
documents with linked entities in two formats for the entity names: 1) explicit
and 2) hashed. We employ a zero-shot end-to-end dense entity linking system for
entity recognition and disambiguation to augment the corpus. By leveraging the
advanced entity linking methods, we believe that the effectiveness gap between
sparse and dense retrievers can be narrowed. We conduct our experiments on the
MS MARCO passage dataset. Since we are concerned with the early stage retrieval
in cascaded ranking architectures of large information retrieval systems, we
evaluate our results using recall@1000. Our approach is also capable of
retrieving documents for query subsets judged to be particularly difficult in
prior work. We further demonstrate that the non-expanded and the expanded runs
with both explicit and hashed entities retrieve complementary results.
Consequently, we adopt a run fusion approach to maximize the benefits of entity
linking.

our classification framework. For the low-frequency observations, we take into
account measured scattering time-scales to infer intrinsic vs scatter
broadening of the pulse profile. Lastly, we discuss the populational trends of
the core/conal class profiles with respect to intrinsic parameters. We
demonstrate that for this sub-population of pulsars, core and conal dominated
profiles cluster together into two roughly segregated $P$-$\dot{P}$
populations, lending credence to the proposal that an evolution in the
pair-formation geometries is responsible for core/conal emission and other
emission effects such as nulling and mode-changing.

classifying malware in a live environment is a difficult task due to the large

by the operating system's kernel. User programs, malware included, interacts
with system resources by making requests to the kernel with system calls.
Collecting these system calls provide insight to the interaction with many

performant model such as a random forest allows fast, accurate classification
in certain situations. In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility of using

Moreover, it permits to describe an explicit matroid subdivision of a

a dense pulsar plasma by curvature radiation from charge bunches. Numerous
studies propose that these charge bunches are relativistic charge solitons
which are solutions of the non-linear Schr\""{o}dinger equation (NLSE) with a
group velocity dispersion ($G$), cubic-nonlinearity($q$) and non-linear Landau
damping ($s$). The formation of stable solitons crucially depends on the
parameters $G, q$ and $s$ and the particle distribution function. In this work,
we use realistic pulsar plasma parameters obtained from observational
constraints to explore the parameter space of NLSE for two representative
distribution functions (DF) of particles' momenta: Lorentzian (long-tailed) and
Gaussian (short-tailed). The choice of DF critically affects the value of
$|s/q|$, which, in turn, determines whether solitons can form. Numerical
simulations show that well-formed solitons are obtained only for small values
of $|s/q| \lesssim 0.1$ while for moderate and higher values of $|s/q| \gtrsim
0.5$ soliton formation is suppressed. Small values for $|s/q| \sim 0.1$ are
readily obtained for long-tailed DF for a wide range of plasma temperatures. On
the other hand, short-tailed DF provides these values only for some narrow
range of plasma parameters. Thus, the presence of a prominent high-energy tail
in the particle DF favours soliton formation for a wide range of plasma
parameters. Besides pair plasma, we also include an iron ion component and find
that they make a negligible contribution in either modifying the NLSE
coefficients or contributing to charge separation.

redshift and absolute UV magnitude ($-22.6 < M_{\rm UV} < 17.9$), sufficient to
allow a meaningful comparison to previous results at lower redshift. Using a
power-law fitting technique, we find that our full sample (median $M_{\rm

Moreover, we find evidence for a $\beta-M_{\rm UV}$ relation, such that
brighter UV galaxies display redder UV slopes ($\rm{d}\beta/ \rm{d} M_{\rm UV}

somewhat bluer than their $z\simeq 5$ counterparts, with an inverse-variance
weighted mean offset of $\langle \Delta \beta \rangle = -0.38 \pm 0.09$. We do
not find strong evidence that any objects in our sample display ultra-blue UV
continuum slopes (i.e., $\beta\lesssim-3$) that would require their UV emission
to be dominated by ultra-young, dust-free stellar populations with high
Lyman-continuum escape fractions. Comparing our results to the predictions of

historical simulations against in situ measurements and the fifth generation

current site conditions are then analysed for the period 2015-2050 using
PRIMAVERA future climate simulations. Over most sites, we find that PRIMAVERA
GCMs show good agreement in temperature, specific humidity, and precipitable
water vapour compared to in situ observations and ERA5. The ability of
PRIMAVERA to simulate those variables increases confidence in their
projections. For those variables, the model ensemble projects an increasing

relative humidity, cloud cover, or astronomical seeing and PRIMAVERA does not
simulate these variables well compared to observations and reanalyses.
Therefore, there is little confidence in these projections. Our results show
that climate change likely increases time lost due to bad site conditions.

group ${\mathbb G}$, which measures the deviation of the group from the class
of Heisenberg-type groups. We show that $\delta({\mathbb G})=0$ if and only if
${\mathbb G}$ carries a vertical metric which endows it with the structure of
an H-type group. We compute the H-type deviation for several naturally
occurring families of step two groups. In addition, we provide analytic
expressions which are comparable to the H-type deviation. As a consequence, we
establish new analytic characterizations for the class of H-type groups. For
instance, denoting by $N(g)=(||x||_h^4+16||t||_v^2)^{1/4}$, $g=\exp(x+t)$, the
canonical Kaplan-type quasi-norm in a step two group ${\mathbb G}$ with taming
Riemannian metric $g_h\oplus g_v$, we show that ${\mathbb G}$ is H-type if and
only if $||\nabla_0 N(g)||_h^2=||x||_h^2/N(g)^2$ for all $g\ne 0$. Similarly,
we show that ${\mathbb G}$ is H-type if and only if $N^{2-Q}$ is ${\mathcal
L}$-harmonic in ${\mathbb G} \setminus \{0\}$. Here $\nabla_0$ denotes the
horizontal differential operator, ${\mathcal L}$ the canonical sub-Laplacian,
and $Q = \dim{\mathfrak v}_1+2\dim{\mathfrak v}_2$ the homogeneous dimension of
${\mathbb G}$, where ${\mathfrak v}_1\oplus{\mathfrak v}_2$ is the
stratification of the Lie algebra. It is well-known that H-type groups satisfy
both of these analytic conclusions. The new content of these results lies in
the converse directions. Motivation for this work comes from a longstanding
conjecture regarding polarizable Carnot groups. We formulate a quantitative
stability conjecture regarding the fundamental solution for the sub-Laplacian
on step two Carnot groups. Its validity would imply that all step two
polarizable groups admit an H-type group structure. We confirm this conjecture

quantum error correction. In a cat code, this encoding relies on the
confinement of the system's dynamics onto the two-dimensional manifold spanned
by Schr\""odinger cats of opposite parity. In dissipative cat qubits, an
engineered dissipation scheme combining two-photon drive and loss has been used
to autonomously stabilize this manifold, ensuring passive protection against
bit-flip errors, regardless of their origin. In Kerr cat qubits, where
highly-performing gates can be engineered, two-photon drive and Kerr
nonlinearity cooperate to confine the system to a two-fold degenerate ground
state manifold spanned by cats of opposite parity. Dissipative, Hamiltonian,
and hybrid confinements have been investigated at resonance. Here, we propose a
critical cat code, where both two-photon loss and Kerr nonlinearity are
present, and the two-photon drive is allowed to be out of resonance. The
performance of this code is assessed via the spectral theory of Liouvillians in
all configurations, from the purely dissipative to the Kerr limit. We show that
large detunings and small, but non-negligible, two-photon loss rates are
fundamental to achieve optimal performance. We demonstrate that the competition
between nonlinearity and detuning results in a first-order dissipative phase
transition, leading to a squeezed vacuum steady state. To achieve the maximal
suppression of the logical bit-flip rate requires initializing the system in
the metastable state emerging from the first-order transition, and we detail a
protocol to do so. Efficiently operating over a broad range of detuning values,
the critical cat code is particularly resistant to random frequency shifts
characterizing multiple-qubit operations, opening venues for the realization of
reliable protocols for scalable and concatenated bosonic qubit architectures.

Telescope (JWST)}, galaxy protoclusters can now be identified and studied in
increasing numbers beyond $z\geq\ $6. Characterising their contribution to the
UV photon budget could supply new insights into the reionisation process. We
analyse the first JWST dataset behind SMACS0723-7327 to search for
protoclusters at $z\geq6$, combining the available spectroscopic and
photometric data. We then compare our findings with semi-analytical models and
simulations. In addition to two bright galaxies ($\leq$26.5 AB in F277W),
separated by $\sim$11\arcsec and spectroscopically confirmed at
$z_{spec}=7.66$, we identify 6 additional galaxies with similar colors in a
$\theta\sim20$\arcsec radius around these (corresponding to R$\sim60-90$ kpc in
the source plane). Using several methods, we estimate the mass of the dark
matter halo of this protocluster, $\sim$3.3$\times$10$^{11}$M$_{\odot}$
accounting for magnification, consistent with various predictions. The physical
properties of all protocluster members are also in excellent agreement with
what has been previously found at lower redshifts: star-formation main sequence
and protocluster size. This detection adds to just a few protoclusters
currently known in the first billion years of the universe.

always be co-lexicographically partially ordered, and an intrinsic measure of
their complexity can be defined and effectively determined, namely, the minimum
width $p$ of one of their admissible co-lex partial orders - dubbed here the
automaton's co-lex width. We first show that this new measure captures at once
the complexity of several seemingly-unrelated hard problems on automata. Any
NFA of co-lex width $p$: (i) has an equivalent powerset DFA whose size is
exponential in $p$ rather than (as a classic analysis shows) in the NFA's size;
(ii) can be encoded using just $\Theta(\log p)$ bits per transition; (iii)
admits a linear-space data structure solving regular expression matching
queries in time proportional to $p^2$ per matched character. Some consequences
of this new parametrization of automata are that PSPACE-hard problems such as
NFA equivalence are FPT in $p$, and quadratic lower bounds for the regular
expression matching problem do not hold for sufficiently small $p$. We prove
that a canonical minimum-width DFA accepting a language $\mathcal L$ - dubbed
the Hasse automaton $\mathcal H$ of $\mathcal L$ - can be exhibited. Finally,
we explore the relationship between two conflicting objectives: minimizing the
width and minimizing the number of states of a DFA. In this context, we provide
an analogous of the Myhill-Nerode Theorem for co-lexicographically ordered
regular languages.

NGC 4277, which is located behind the Virgo cluster.
  Methods: We measured the bar length and strength from the surface photometry
obtained from the broad-band imaging of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and we
derived the bar pattern speed from the stellar kinematics obtained from the
integral-field spectroscopy performed with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic
Explorer at the Very Large Telescope. We also estimated the co-rotation radius
from the circular velocity, which we constrained by correcting the stellar
streaming motions for asymmetric drift, and we finally derived the bar rotation
rate.
  Results: We found that NGC 4277 hosts a short ($R_{bar}=3.2^{+0.9}_{-0.6}$
kpc), weak ($S_{bar}=0.21 \pm 0.02$), and slow ($R=1.8^{+0.5}_ {-0.3}$) bar and
its pattern speed ($\Omega_{bar}=24.7\pm3.4$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$) is amongst
the best-constrained ones ever obtained with the Tremaine-Weinberg (TW) method
with relative statistical errors of $\sim0.2$.
  Conclusions: NGC 4277 is the first clear-cut case of a galaxy hosting a slow
stellar bar ($R>1.4$ at more than a 1$\sigma$ confidence level) measured with
the model-independent TW method. A possible interaction with the neighbour
galaxy NGC 4273 could have triggered the formation of such a slow bar and/or
the bar could be slowed down due to the dynamical friction with a significant
amount of dark matter within the bar region.

multiple data sets, on any metric. The model is based on the Bradley-Terry
model, that counts the number of times one algorithm performs better than
another on different data sets. Because of its Bayesian foundations, the
Bayesian Bradley Terry model (BBT) has different characteristics than
frequentist approaches to comparing multiple algorithms on multiple data sets,
such as Demsar (2006) tests on mean rank, and Benavoli et al. (2016) multiple
pairwise Wilcoxon tests with p-adjustment procedures. In particular, a Bayesian
approach allows for more nuanced statements regarding the algorithms beyond
claiming that the difference is or it is not statistically significant.
Bayesian approaches also allow to define when two algorithms are equivalent for
practical purposes, or the region of practical equivalence (ROPE). Different
than a Bayesian signed rank comparison procedure proposed by Benavoli et al.
(2017), our approach can define a ROPE for any metric, since it is based on
probability statements, and not on differences of that metric. This paper also
proposes a local ROPE concept, that evaluates whether a positive difference
between a mean measure across some cross validation to the mean of some other
algorithms is should be really seen as the first algorithm being better than
the second, based on effect sizes. This local ROPE proposal is independent of a
Bayesian use, and can be used in frequentist approaches based on ranks. A R
package and a Python program that implements the BBT is available.

suggest that X-ray obscuration is present in all three quasars. We propose
that, as an alternative to the intrinsic X-ray weakness + X-ray obscuration
scenario, the soft and hard X-ray weakness of these quasars can be uniformly
explained under an obscuration-only scenario. This model provides adequate
descriptions of the multi-epoch soft and hard X-ray data of these quasars, with
variable column density and leaked fraction of the partial-covering absorber.
We suggest that the absorber is the clumpy dust-free wind launched from the
accretion disk. These quasars probably have super-Eddington accretion rates

This is of particular importance for missions such as ESA's Comet Interceptor

  We find that the lack of knowledge of any particular comet results in very
large uncertainties (~3 orders of magnitude) for the dust densities within the
coma. The most sensitive parameters affecting the dust densities are the dust
size distribution, the dust production rate and coma brightness, often
quantified by Af$\rho$. Further, the conversion of a coma's brightness
(Af$\rho$) to a dust production rate is poorly constrained. The dust production
rate can only be estimated down to an uncertainty of ~0.5 orders of magnitude
if the dust size distribution is known in addition to the Af$\rho$.
  To accurately predict the dust environment of a poorly known comet, a
statistical approach as we propose here needs to be taken to properly reflect
the uncertainties. This can be done by calculating an ensemble of comae
covering all possible combinations within parameter space as shown in this

a diluter as PBH typically leads to DM overproduction. This leads to a second
early matter dominated epoch after PBH evaporation due to the long-lived
diluter. These two early matter dominated epochs, crucially connected to the DM

the multi-band light curves to refine the periods and inspect the amplitude
variation between different photometric bands. The infrared brightness of the

follows a well-defined selection function as expected from artificial star
tests. The multi-band photometry is modelled using stellar models with
circumstellar dust that characterise the mass loss rates. We demonstrate how

spintronics because of its premise for devices using spin current carried by
magnons, quanta of spin-wave excitations of a macroscopically ordered magnetic
media. Although magnonics has clear energy-wise advantage over conventional
electronics due to the absence of the Joule heating, the inherent magnon-magnon
interactions give rise to finite lifetime of the magnons which has been
hampering the efficient realizations of magnonic devices. To promote magnonics,
it is imperative to identify the delocalized magnon modes that are minimally
affected by magnon-magnon interactions and thus possess a long lifetime and use
them to achieve efficient magnon transport. Here, we suggest that quasicrystals
may offer the solution to this problem via the critical magnon modes that are
neither extended nor localized. We find that the critical magnon exhibits
fractal characteristics that are absent in conventional magnon modes in regular
solids such as a unique power-law scaling and a self-similar distribution of
distances showing perfect magnon transmission. Moreover, the critical magnons
have longer lifetimes compared to the extended ones in a periodic system, by
suppressing the magnon-magnon interaction decay rate. Such enhancement of the
magnon stability originates from the presence of the quasi-periodicity and
intermediate localization behavior of the critical magnons. Thus, we offer the

ideal for the testing and calibration of theoretical stellar evolutionary

against the single star sequence. We find that the non-rotating MESA models for
[Fe/H] = +0.25 provide a good fit for stars with masses above 0.85, and very
low mass stars below 0.25 M$_\odot$. For stars with masses between 0.25 and
0.85 M$_\odot$ the models systematically under predict the observed stellar
luminosity. One potential limitation of the models for partially convective
stars more massive than 0.35 M$_\odot$ is the prescription of (superadiabatic)
convection with the mixing-length theory parameter $\alpha_{\rm ML}$ tuned to
match the Solar model. Below 0.35 M$_\odot$, the increased scatter in the
stellar sequence might be a manifestation of the convective kissing
instability, which is driven by variations in the $^3$He nuclear energy
production rate due to instabilities at the convective core to envelope
boundary. For a Hyades-like stellar population, the application of solar-scaled
models to subsolar mass stars could result in a significant underestimate of
the age, or an overestimate of the metallicity. We suggest that future grids of
solar-scaled evolutionary stellar models could be complemented by Hyades-scaled
models in the mass range 0.25 to 0.85 M$_\odot$.

The dual fraction is roughly constant while the offset fraction increases by a
factor of ten from $z=4\sim2$. Compared with the full AGN population, duals are
characterized by a low $M_\text{BH}/M_*$ ratio, a high specific star-formation
rate (sSFR) of $\sim 1\,\text{Gyr}^{-1}$, and a high Eddington ratio ($\sim
0.05$, double that of single AGN). The dual AGN are formed in major galaxy
mergers (typically involving $M_\text{halo}<10^{13}\,M_\odot$), with BHs that
have similar masses. At small separations (when their host galaxies are in the
late phase of the merger) duals become $2\sim8$ times brighter (albeit more
obscured) than at larger separations. $80\%$ of these bright, close duals merge
in the simulation within $\sim500\,\text{Myrs}$. Notably, the initially
less-massive BH in duals frequently becomes the brighter AGN during the galaxy
merger. In offset AGN, the active BH is typically $\gtrsim 10$ times more
massive than its non-active counterpart and than most BHs in duals. Offsets are
predominantly formed in minor galaxy mergers with the active BH residing in the
center of massive halos ($ M_\text{ halo}\sim 10^{13-14}\,M_\odot$). In these
deep potentials, gas stripping is common and the secondary quickly deactivates.
The stripping also leads to inefficient orbital decay amongst offsets, which
stall at $\Delta r\sim5\,\text{kpc}$ for a few hundred Myrs.

range of applications, we demonstrate its utility by investigating the
distribution of dust in the interstellar medium of 310 star-forming galaxies at
spectroscopic redshifts $1.36<z<1.66$ observed by the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution
Field (MOSDEF) survey. The stellar continuum reddening distribution, derived
from high-resolution multi-waveband CANDELS/3D-HST imaging, is quantified using
the patchiness, Gini, and $M_{20}$ coefficients. We find that the reddening
maps of high-mass galaxies, which are dustier and more metal-rich on average,
tend to exhibit patchier distributions (high $P$) with the reddest components
concentrated within a single region (low $M_{20}$). Our results support a
picture where dust is uniformly distributed in low-mass galaxies
($\lesssim$10$^{10}$ $M_\odot$), implying efficient mixing of dust throughout
the interstellar medium. On the other hand, the dust distribution is patchier
in high-mass galaxies ($\gtrsim$10$^{10}$ $M_\odot$). Dust is concentrated near
regions of active star formation and dust mixing timescales are expected to be
longer in high-mass galaxies, such that the outskirt regions of these
physically larger galaxies remain relatively unenriched. This study presents
direct evidence for patchy dust distributions on scales of a few kpc in
high-redshift galaxies, which previously has only been suggested as a possible
explanation for the observed differences between nebular and stellar continuum
reddening, SFR indicators, and dust attenuation curves.

corrected for pair completeness in Gaia, which we quantify as functions of pair

dictates the timescales of planet formation. In this paper, we present
magnetospheric accretion and inner disk wall model fits to NUV-NIR spectra of
nine classical T Tauri stars in Orion OB1b as part of the Outflows and Disks
around Young Stars: Synergies for the Exploration of ULLYSES Spectra (ODYSSEUS)
Survey. Using NUV-optical spectra from the Hubble UV Legacy Library of Young
Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES) Director's Discretionary Program and
optical-NIR spectra from the PENELLOPE VLT Large Programme, we find that the
accretion rates of these targets are relatively high for the region's
intermediate age of 5.0 Myr; rates range from $0.5-17.2 \times 10^{-8}$
M$_{\odot}$/yr, with a median value of $1.2\times 10^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$/yr. The
NIR excesses can be fit with 1200-1800 K inner disk walls located at 0.05-0.10
AU from the host stars. We discuss the significance of the choice in extinction
law, as the measured accretion rate depends strongly on the adopted extinction
value. This analysis will be extended to the complete sample of T Tauri stars
being observed through ULLYSES to characterize accretion and inner disks in
star-forming regions of different ages and stellar populations.

allowing for larger problems to be analyzed with present-day quantum annealers.

are difficult to integrate application algorithms as their uncertainty limits
practical tracking of algorithmic progress and reliable stopping. Accordingly,
in this work, we develop theoretically-rigorous, practical tools for
quantifying the uncertainty of an important class of iterative randomized least

gravitating region $a$ can be assigned a generalized entanglement wedge
$E\supset a$, such that quasi-local operators in $E$ have a holographic
representation in the full algebra generated by quasi-local operators in $a$.
The universe need not be asymptotically flat or AdS, and $a$ need not be
asymptotic or weakly gravitating.
  On a static Cauchy surface $\Sigma$, we propose that $E$ is the superset of
$a$ that minimizes the generalized entropy. We prove that $E$ satisfies a
no-cloning theorem and appropriate forms of strong subadditivity and nesting.
If $a$ lies near a portion $A$ of the conformal boundary of AdS, our proposal
reduces to the Quantum Minimal Surface prescription applied to $A$. We also
discuss possible covariant extensions of this proposal, such as the smallest
generalized entropy quantum normal superset of $a$.
  Our results are consistent with the conjecture that information in $E$ that
is spacelike to $a$ in the semiclassical description can nevertheless be
recovered from $a$, by microscopic operators that break that description. We
thus propose that $E$ quantifies the range of holographic encoding, an
important nonlocal feature of quantum gravity, in general spacetimes.

resolvers. Today, many client-side deployments of DoH, particularly in
browsers, select between only a few resolvers, despite the fact that many more
encrypted DNS resolvers are deployed in practice. Unfortunately, if users only
have a few choices of encrypted resolver, and only a few perform well from any
particular vantage point, then the privacy problems that DoH was deployed to
help address merely shift to a different set of third parties. It is thus
important to assess the performance characteristics of more encrypted DNS
resolvers, to determine how many options for encrypted DNS resolvers users tend
to have in practice. In this paper, we explore the performance of a large group
of encrypted DNS resolvers supporting DoH by measuring DNS query response times
from global vantage points in North America, Europe, and Asia. Our results show
that many non-mainstream resolvers have higher response times than mainstream

those made possible by the Roman and Euclid space telescopes will be prone to
line mis-identification, leading to interloper galaxies at the wrong redshifts
in the large-scale structure catalogues. The most pernicious of these have a
small displacement between true and false redshift such that the interloper
positions are correlated with the target galaxies. We consider how to correct
for such contaminants, focusing on $\rm H\beta$ interlopers in [OIII]
catalogues as will be observed by Roman, which are misplaced by $\Delta d = 97
\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$ at redshift $z = 1$. Because this displacement is close to
the BAO scale, the peak in the interloper-target galaxy cross-correlation
function at the displacement scale can change the shape of the BAO peak in the
auto-correlation of the contaminated catalogue, and lead to incorrect
cosmological measurements if not accounted for properly. We consider how to
build a model for the monopole and quadrupole moments of the contaminated
correlation function, including an additional free parameter for the fraction
of interlopers. The key input to this model is the cross-correlation between
the population of galaxies forming the interlopers and the main target sample.
It will be important to either estimate this using calibration data or to use
the contaminated small-scale auto-correlation function to model it, which may
be possible if a number of requirements about the galaxy populations are met.
We find that this method is successful in measuring the BAO dilation parameters
without significant degradation in accuracy, provided the cross-correlation
function is accurately known.

discuss the updated design and in-lab characterization of new 90 GHz detectors.
The new detectors include design changes to the transition-edge sensor (TES)
bolometer architecture, which aim to improve stability and optical efficiency.
We assembled and tested four new detector wafers, to replace four modules of
the W1 focal plane. These detectors were installed into the W1 telescope, and
will achieve first light in the austral winter of 2022. We present
electrothermal parameters and bandpass measurements from in-lab dark and

$\mathrm{aW\sqrt{s}}$ across all four wafers about the CLASS signal band, which
is below the expected photon NEP of 32 $\mathrm{aW\sqrt{s}}$ from the field. We
therefore expect the new detectors to be photon noise limited.

engineers in the automatic generation of systems diagrams from unstructured

extract entities and their relationships from textual resources (e.g.,

(SysML) diagrams, with particular focus on structure and requirement diagrams.
The intention is to provide the users with a more standardised, comprehensive

diagrams according to their needs. The proposed approach is flexible and
open-domain. It consists of six steps which leverage open-access tools, and it
leads to an automatic generation of SysML diagrams without intermediate
modelling requirement, but through the specification of a set of parameters by
the user. The applicability and benefits of the proposed approach are shown
through six case studies having different textual sources as inputs, and
benchmarked against manually defined diagram elements.

adversarial mechanism with representation learning to attain a
privacy-preserving feature representation of the original geolocated data

maximally reduce the chance of user re-identification and full data
reconstruction with a minimal utility budget (i.e., loss). We train the
mechanism by quantifying privacy-utility trade-off of mobility datasets in
terms of trajectory reconstruction risk, user re-identification risk, and
mobility predictability. We report an exploratory analysis that enables the
user to assess this trade-off with a specific loss function and its weight
parameters. The extensive comparison results on four representative mobility
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed architecture in mobility
privacy protection and the efficiency of the proposed privacy-preserving
features extractor. We show that the privacy of mobility traces attains decent
protection at the cost of marginal mobility utility. Our results also show that

which can play an important role in the function, regulation, and organization
of membrane proteins. Membrane elasticity theory provides a beautiful
description of protein-induced lipid bilayer deformations, in which all
physical parameters can be directly determined from experiments. Analytic
treatments of the membrane elasticity theory of protein-induced lipid bilayer
deformations have largely focused on idealized protein shapes with circular
cross section, and on perturbative solutions for proteins with non-circular
cross section. We develop here a boundary value method (BVM) that permits the
construction of non-perturbative analytic solutions of protein-induced lipid
bilayer deformations for non-circular protein cross sections, for constant as
well as variable boundary conditions along the bilayer-protein interface. We
apply this BVM to protein-induced lipid bilayer thickness deformations. Our BVM
reproduces available analytic solutions for proteins with circular cross
section and yields, for proteins with non-circular cross section, excellent
agreement with numerical, finite element solutions. On this basis, we formulate
a simple analytic approximation of the bilayer thickness deformation energy
associated with general protein shapes and show that, for modest deviations
from rotational symmetry, this analytic approximation is in good agreement with
BVM solutions. Using the BVM, we survey the dependence of protein-induced lipid
bilayer thickness deformations on protein shape, and thus explore how the
coupling of protein shape and bilayer thickness deformations affects protein
oligomerization and transitions in protein conformational state.

curiosity-driven, child-led approach can provide more agency to children when
they are authoring data visualizations. This paper explores how informal
learning with crafting physicalizations through play and curiosity may foster
increased literacy and engagement with data. Employing a constructionist
approach, we designed a do-it-yourself toolkit made out of everyday materials
(e.g., paper, cardboard, mirrors) that enables children to create, customize,
and personalize three different interactive visualizations (bar, line, pie). We
used the toolkit as a design probe in a series of in-person workshops with 5
children (6 to 11-year-olds) and interviews with 5 educators. Our observations
reveal that the toolkit helped children creatively engage and interact with
visualizations. Children with prior knowledge of data visualization reported
the toolkit serving as more of an authoring tool that they envision using in
their daily lives, while children with little to no experience found the
toolkit as an engaging introduction to data visualization. Our study
demonstrates the potential of using the constructionist approach to cultivate
children's DVL through curiosity and play.

present the first NIR detection of accretion from the companion in Pa$\beta$,
Pa$\gamma$, and Br$\gamma$ emission lines from SOAR/TripleSpec 4.1, confirming
and further informing its accreting nature. The companion shows strong line
emission, with $L_{line} \approx 1-6 \times 10^{-8}~L_\odot$ across lines and
epochs, while the binary host system shows no NIR hydrogen line emission
($L_{line} <0.32-11\times10^{-7}\ L_\odot$). Observed NIR hydrogen line ratios
are more consistent with a planetary accretion shock than with local line
excitation models commonly used to interpret stellar magnetospheric accretion.
Using planetary accretion shock models, we derive mass accretion rate estimates
of $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{pla}}\sim3$-$4\times 10^{-8}\ M_\mathrm{J}$ yr$^{-1}$,
somewhat higher than expected under the standard star formation paradigm.
Delorme 1 (AB)b's high accretion rate is perhaps more consistent with formation
via disk fragmentation. Delorme 1 (AB)b is the first protoplanet candidate with
clear (S/N$\sim$5) NIR hydrogen line emission.

In many models, especially beginning from stellar relic ""seeds,"" this requires
sustained super-Eddington accretion. While studies have shown BHs can violate
the Eddington limit on accretion disk scales given sufficient ""fueling"" from
larger scales, what remains unclear is whether or not BHs can actually capture
sufficient gas from their surrounding ISM. We explore this in a suite of
multi-physics high-resolution simulations of BH growth in magnetized,
star-forming dense gas complexes including dynamical stellar feedback from
radiation, stellar mass-loss, and supernovae, exploring populations of seeds
with masses $\sim 1-10^{4}\,M_{\odot}$. In this initial study, we neglect
feedback from the BHs: so this sets a strong upper limit to the accretion rates
seeds can sustain. We show that stellar feedback plays a key role. Complexes
with gravitational pressure/surface density below $\sim 10^{3}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm
pc^{-2}}$ are disrupted with low star formation efficiencies so provide poor
environments for BH growth. But in denser cloud complexes, early stellar
feedback does not rapidly destroy the clouds but does generate strong shocks
and dense clumps, allowing $\sim 1\%$ of randomly-initialized seeds to
encounter a dense clump with low relative velocity and produce runaway,
hyper-Eddington accretion (growing by orders of magnitude). Remarkably, mass
growth under these conditions is almost independent of initial BH mass,
allowing rapid IMBH formation even for stellar-mass seeds. This defines a
necessary (but perhaps not sufficient) set of criteria for runaway BH growth:
we provide analytic estimates for the probability of runaway growth under
different ISM conditions.

research areas in video analytics domain. Over the last decade, numerous
advanced deep learning algorithms have been introduced to recognize complex

impressive performance for the human activity recognition task. However, these
newly introduced methods either exclusively focus on model performance or the
effectiveness of these models in terms of computational efficiency and
robustness, resulting in a biased tradeoff in their proposals to deal with
challenging human activity recognition problem. To overcome the limitations of
contemporary deep learning models for human activity recognition, this paper
presents a computationally efficient yet generic spatial-temporal cascaded
framework that exploits the deep discriminative spatial and temporal features
for human activity recognition. For efficient representation of human actions,
we have proposed an efficient dual attentional convolutional neural network
(CNN) architecture that leverages a unified channel-spatial attention mechanism
to extract human-centric salient features in video frames. The dual
channel-spatial attention layers together with the convolutional layers learn
to be more attentive in the spatial receptive fields having objects over the
number of feature maps. The extracted discriminative salient features are then
forwarded to stacked bi-directional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) for long-term
temporal modeling and recognition of human actions using both forward and
backward pass gradient learning. Extensive experiments are conducted, where the
obtained results show that the proposed framework attains an improvement in
execution time up to 167 times in terms of frames per second as compared to
most of the contemporary action recognition methods.

its practicability. In this paper, a novel deep neural network (DNN) structure
named adaptive target-condition neural network (A-TCNN) is proposed, which
conducts AP selection for one target user upon the condition of other users.
Also, an adaptive mechanism is developed to map a smaller number of users to a
larger number through splitting their data rate requirements, without affecting
the AP selection result for the target user. This enables the proposed method
to handle different numbers of users without the need for retraining. Results
show that A-TCNN achieves a network throughput very close to that of the
testing dataset, with a gap less than 3%. It is also proven that A-TCNN can
obtain a network throughput comparable to two SOTA benchmarks, while reducing
the runtime by up to three orders of magnitude.

commissioning. In this study, we aim to characterize 250 MeV protons from
Varian ProBeam system for FLASH RT as well as assess the ability of clinical
monitoring ionization chamber (MIC) for FLASH-readiness. We measured data
needed for beam commissioning: integral depth dose (IDD) curve, spot sigma, and
absolute dose calibration. To evaluate MIC, we measured output as a function of
beam current. To characterize a 250 MeV FLASH beam, we measured: (1) central
axis DR as a function of current and spot spacing and arrangement, (2) for a
fixed spot spacing, the maximum field size that still achieves FLASH DR (i.e.,
> 40 Gy/s), (3) DR reproducibility. All FLASH DR measurements were performed
using ion chamber for the absolute dose and irradiation times were obtained
from log files. We verified dose measurements using EBT-XD films and
irradiation times using a fast, pixelated spectral detector. R90 and R80 from
IDD were 37.58 and 37.69 cm, and spot sigma at isocenter were {\sigma}x=3.336
and {\sigma}y=3.332 mm, respectively. The absolute dose output was measured as
0.377 GyE*mm2/MU for the commissioning conditions. Output was stable for beam
currents up to 15 nA, and it gradually increased to 12-fold for 115 nA. DR
depended on beam current, spot spacing and arrangement and could be reproduced
within 4.2% variations. Even though FLASH was achieved and the largest field
size that delivers FLASH DR was determined as 35x35 mm2, current MIC has DR

perturbations and subsequent collisionless equilibration, predominantly via
phase-mixing. We use linear perturbation theory to study the response of
infinite isothermal slab analogues of disks to perturbations with diverse
spatio-temporal characteristics. Without self-gravity of the response, the
dominant Fourier modes that get excited in a disk are the bending and breathing
modes, which, due to vertical phase-mixing, trigger local phase-space spirals
that are one- and two-armed, respectively. We demonstrate how the lateral
streaming motion of slab stars causes phase spirals to damp out over time. The
ratio of the perturbation timescale ($\tau_{\mathrm{P}}$) to the local,
vertical oscillation time ($\tau_z$) ultimately decides which of the two modes
is excited. Faster, more impulsive ($\tau_{\mathrm{P}} < \tau_z$) and slower,
more adiabatic ($\tau_{\mathrm{P}} > \tau_z$) perturbations excite stronger
breathing and bending modes, respectively, although the response to very slow
perturbations is exponentially suppressed. For encounters with satellite
galaxies, this translates to more distant and more perpendicular encounters
triggering stronger bending modes. We compute the direct response of the Milky
Way disk to several of its satellite galaxies, and find that recent encounters
with all of them excite bending modes in the Solar neighborhood. The encounter
with Sagittarius triggers a response that is at least $1-2$ orders of magnitude
larger than that due to any other satellite, including the Large Magellanic
Cloud. We briefly discuss how ignoring the presence of a dark matter halo and
the self-gravity of the response might impact our conclusions.

  exoplanet","Accepted in MNRAS (2022)",,"10.1093/mnras/stac2621",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, a number of eccentric debris belts have been observed in
extrasolar systems. The most common explanation for their shape is the presence
of a nearby eccentric planetary companion. The gravitational perturbation from
such a companion would induce periodic eccentricity variations on the
planetesimals in the belt, with a range of precession frequencies. The overall
expected shape is an eccentric belt with a finite minimum width. However,
several observed eccentric debris discs have been found to exhibit a narrower
width than the theoretical expectation. In this paper, we study two mechanisms
that can produce this small width: (i) the protoplanetary disc can interact
with the planet and/or the planetesimals, slowly driving the eccentricity of
the former and damping the eccentricities of the latter; (ii) the companion
planet could have gained its eccentricity stochastically, through planet-planet
scatterings. We show that under appropriate conditions, both of these scenarios
offer a plausible way to reduce the minimum width of an eccentric belt exterior
to a perturbing planet. However, the effects of protoplanetary discs are
diminished at large separations (a > 10 au) due to the scarcity of gas and the
limited disc lifetime. These findings suggest that one can use the shape and
width of debris discs to shed light on the evolution of extrasolar systems,
constraining the protoplanetary disc properties and the prevalence of
planet-planet scatterings. Further observations of debris-harbouring systems
could confirm whether thin debris belts are a common occurrence, or the results
of rare initial conditions or evolutionary processes.

can be realized through direct resonant excitation, excitation via an

facilitated by the tunability of both the laser-beam and ion-bunch parameters.
The expected nuclear hyperfine mixing effect in H- or Li-like $^{229}$Th ions
offers unique opportunities for exciting thorium isomers. The significantly
reduced isomeric-state lifetime corresponds to much higher excitation rates for
direct resonant excitation. Importantly, we propose electric dipole transitions
changing both the electronic and nuclear states that are opened due to the

excitation in Li-like $^{229}$Th ions. Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage as

algorithm, which was originally devised to verify safety properties of
finite-state transition systems. The algorithm is state-of-the-art in hardware
model checking. It derives interpolants from unsatisfiable BMC queries, and
collects them to construct an overapproximation of the set of reachable states.
Unlike other formal-verification algorithms, such as k-induction or PDR, which
have been extended to handle infinite-state systems and investigated for
program analysis, McMillan's interpolation-based model checking algorithm from
2003 has not been used to verify programs so far. This paper closes this
significant, 19 years old gap in knowledge by adopting the algorithm to
software verification. We implemented it in the verification framework
CPAchecker, and evaluated the implementation against other state-of-the-art
software-verification techniques over the largest publicly available benchmark
suite of C safety-verification tasks. The evaluation demonstrates that
interpolation-based model checking is competitive among other algorithms in
terms of both the number of solved verification tasks and the run-time
efficiency. Our results might have important implications for software
verification, because researchers and developers now have a richer set of

of planar silicon sensors with non-parallel strips, and cylindrical micromegas
sensors with longitudinal and arc-shaped strips located within a 5~T

without requiring the time-consuming inversion of large matrices. This is the
first time that this algorithm has been adapted for use with hybrid

(LRL) is careful management of the agent's learning experiences, to learn
(without forgetting) and build internal meta-models (of the tasks,
environments, agents, and world). Generative replay (GR) is a biologically
inspired replay mechanism that augments learning experiences with self-labelled
examples drawn from an internal generative model that is updated over time. We
present a version of GR for LRL that satisfies two desiderata: (a)
Introspective density modelling of the latent representations of policies
learned using deep RL, and (b) Model-free end-to-end learning. In this paper,
we study three deep learning architectures for model-free GR, starting from a
na\""ive GR and adding ingredients to achieve (a) and (b). We evaluate our
proposed algorithms on three different scenarios comprising tasks from the
Starcraft-2 and Minigrid domains. We report several key findings showing the
impact of the design choices on quantitative metrics that include transfer
learning, generalization to unseen tasks, fast adaptation after task change,
performance wrt task expert, and catastrophic forgetting. We observe that our
GR prevents drift in the features-to-action mapping from the latent vector
space of a deep RL agent. We also show improvements in established lifelong
learning metrics. We find that a small random replay buffer significantly
increases the stability of training. Overall, we find that ""hidden replay"" (a
well-known architecture for class-incremental classification) is the most
promising approach that pushes the state-of-the-art in GR for LRL and observe
that the architecture of the sleep model might be more important for improving
performance than the types of replay used. Our experiments required only 6% of
training samples to achieve 80-90% of expert performance in most Starcraft-2

control framework to handle safety-critical position-based constraints for
human-robot physical interaction. The proposed methodology is based on
admittance control, exponential control barrier functions (ECBFs) and quadratic
program (QP) to achieve compliance during the force interaction between human
and robot, while simultaneously guaranteeing safety constraints. In particular,
the formulation of admittance control is rewritten as a second-order nonlinear
control system, and the interaction forces between humans and robots are
regarded as the control input. A virtual force feedback for admittance control
is provided in real-time by using the ECBFs-QP framework as a compensator of
the external human forces. A safe trajectory is therefore derived from the
proposed adaptive admittance control scheme for a low-level controller to
track. The innovation of the proposed approach is that the proposed controller
will enable the robot to comply with human forces with natural fluidity without
violation of any safety constraints even in cases where human external forces
incidentally force the robot to violate constraints. The effectiveness of our
approach is demonstrated in simulation studies on a two-link planar robot
manipulator.

particularly on the case when the target surface is prescribed as the zero
isocontour of a smooth discrete function. Common examples of this scenario
include using level set functions to represent material interfaces in
multimaterial configurations, and evolving geometries in shape and topology
optimization. The proposed method formulates the mesh optimization problem as a
variational minimization of the sum of a chosen mesh-quality metric using the
Target-Matrix Optimization Paradigm (TMOP) and a penalty term that weakly
forces the selected faces of the mesh to align with the target surface. The
distinct features of the method are use of a source mesh to represent the level
set function with sufficient accuracy, and adaptive strategies for setting the
penalization weight and selecting the faces of the mesh to be fit to the target
isocontour of the level set field. We demonstrate that the proposed method is
robust for generating boundary- and interface-fitted meshes for curvilinear
domains using different element types in 2D and 3D.

allowed values of the LQ coupling constants, which means that this decay would
be below the reach of future experimental measurements. We also consider an
scenario with three scalar doublets, which was recently proposed to explain the
lepton flavor universality violation anomalies in $B$ decays as well as the
muon $g-2$ anomaly. Although this scenario allows large LQ couplings to the tau
lepton and the $c$ and $t$ quarks, the branching ratio of the $t\to

masses of 1.7 TeV.

admittance control to enhance physical human-robot collaboration. The proposed
method combines the benefits of compliance to external forces of admittance
control and high robustness to uncertainties of integral sliding mode control
(ISMC), such that the system can collaborate with a human partner in an
uncertain environment effectively. Firstly, a fixed-time sliding surface is
applied in the ISMC to make the tracking error of the system converge within a
fixed-time regardless of the initial condition. Then, a fixed-time backstepping
controller (BSP) is integrated into the ISMC as the nominal controller to
realize global fixed-time convergence. Furthermore, to overcome the singularity
problem, a non-singular fixed-time sliding surface is designed and integrated
into the controller, which is useful for practical application. Finally, the
proposed controller is validated for a two-link robot manipulator with
uncertainties and external human forces. The results show that the proposed
controller is superior in the sense of both tracking error and convergence
time, and at the same time, can comply with human motion in a shared workspace.

translated frame-by-frame into an electrical stimulation pattern that is sent

computer vision techniques, such as depth estimation to highlight nearby

objects in the scene (EdgesOnly mode). However, nobody has attempted to combine
the two, either by presenting them together (EdgesAndDepth) or by giving the

a neurobiologically inspired model of simulated prosthetic vision (SPV) in an

better at avoiding obstacles using depth-based cues as opposed to relying on

relieve the burden on cloud centres, edge-cloud computation offloading becomes
a promising solution since shortening the proximity between the data source and
the computation by offloading computation tasks from the cloud to edge devices
can improve performance and Quality of Service (QoS). Several optimisation
models of edge-cloud computation offloading have been proposed that take
computation costs and heterogeneous communication costs into account. However,
several important factors are not jointly considered, such as heterogeneities
of tasks, load balancing among nodes and the profit yielded by computation
tasks, which lead to the profit and cost-oriented computation offloading

probabilistic projections for each of the scenarios. Obtaining a confidence
interval on the impact of the decision (e.g., number of deaths averted) is
important for decision making. However, obtaining tight bounds only from the
probabilistic projections for the individual scenarios is difficult, as the
joint probability is not known. Further, the models may not be able to generate
the joint probability distribution due to various reasons including the need to
rewrite simulations, and storage and transfer requirements.

a non-trivial bound on the outcomes due to the decision variable. We first
prove, under a key assumption, that an $\alpha-$confidence interval on the

found that policies that are highly capable against regular opponents can fail
catastrophically against adversarial policies: an opponent trained explicitly
against the victim. Prior defenses using adversarial training were able to make
the victim robust to a specific adversary, but the victim remained vulnerable
to new ones. We conjecture this limitation was due to insufficient diversity of
adversaries seen during training. We analyze a defense using population based
training to pit the victim against a diverse set of opponents. We evaluate this
defense's robustness against new adversaries in two low-dimensional
environments. This defense increases robustness against adversaries, as
measured by the number of attacker training timesteps to exploit the victim.
Furthermore, we show that robustness is correlated with the size of the
opponent population.

azimuthal asymmetries in back-to-back dihadron electroproduction, where two
hadrons are produced in opposite hemispheres along the z-axis in the
center-of-mass frame, with the first hadron produced in the
current-fragmentation region and the second in the target-fragmentation region.
The data were taken with longitudinally polarized electron beams of 10.2 and
10.6 GeV incident on an unpolarized liquid-hydrogen target using the CLAS12
spectrometer at Jefferson Lab. Observed non-zero $\sin\Delta\phi$ modulations
in $ep \rightarrow e'p\pi^+X$ events, where $\Delta\phi$ is the difference of
the azimuthal angles of the proton and pion in the virtual photon and target
nucleon center-of-mass frame, indicate that correlations between the spin and
transverse momenta of hadrons produced in the target- and current-fragmentation
regions may be significant. The measured beam-spin asymmetries provide a first
access in dihadron production to a previously unobserved leading-twist spin-
and transverse-momentum-dependent fracture function. The fracture functions
describe the hadronization of the target remnant after the hard scattering of a
virtual photon off a quark in the target particle and provide a new avenue for
studying nucleonic structure and hadronization.

  Workshop In conjunction with EDM 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Conducting randomized experiments in education settings raises the question
of how we can use machine learning techniques to improve educational
interventions. Using Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) algorithms like Thompson
Sampling (TS) in adaptive experiments can increase students' chances of
obtaining better outcomes by increasing the probability of assignment to the
most optimal condition (arm), even before an intervention completes. This is an
advantage over traditional A/B testing, which may allocate an equal number of
students to both optimal and non-optimal conditions. The problem is the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. Even though adaptive policies aim to
collect enough information to allocate more students to better arms reliably,
past work shows that this may not be enough exploration to draw reliable
conclusions about whether arms differ. Hence, it is of interest to provide
additional uniform random (UR) exploration throughout the experiment. This
paper shows a real-world adaptive experiment on how students engage with
instructors' weekly email reminders to build their time management habits. Our
metric of interest is open email rates which tracks the arms represented by
different subject lines. These are delivered following different allocation
algorithms: UR, TS, and what we identified as TS{\dag} - which combines both TS
and UR rewards to update its priors. We highlight problems with these adaptive
algorithms - such as possible exploitation of an arm when there is no
significant difference - and address their causes and consequences. Future
directions includes studying situations where the early choice of the optimal
arm is not ideal and how adaptive algorithms can address them.

In lasers, the two interacting frequencies can be the cavity repetition rate

breather oscillations in lasers naturally triggers a second characteristic
frequency in the system, therefore showing competition between the cavity
repetition rate and the breathing frequency. Yet, the link between breathing
solitons and frequency locking is missing. Here we demonstrate frequency
locking at Farey fractions of a breather laser. The winding numbers show the
hierarchy of the Farey tree and the structure of a devil's staircase. Numerical
simulations of a discrete laser model confirm the experimental findings. The
breather laser may therefore serve as a simple model system to explore
universal synchronization dynamics of nonlinear systems. The locked breathing
frequencies feature high signal-to-noise ratio and can give rise to dense

finite total relative-energy including the origin, while cavitation may occur
as balls centred at the origin of symmetry for which the interfaces between the
fluid and the vacuum must be upper semi-continuous in space-time in the
Eulerian coordinates. On any region strictly away from the possible vacuum, the
velocity and specific internal energy are H\""older continuous, and the density
has a uniform upper bound. To achieve these, our main strategy is to regard the
Cauchy problem as the limit of a series of carefully designed initial-boundary
value problems that are formulated in finite annular regions. For such
approximation problems, we can derive uniform {\it a-priori} estimates that are
independent of both the inner and outer radii of the annuli considered in the
spherically symmetric Lagrangian coordinates. The entropy inequality is
recovered after taking the limit of the outer radius to infinity by using
Mazur's lemma and the convexity of the entropy function, which is required for
the limit of the inner radius tending to zero. Then the global weak solutions
of the original problem are attained via careful compactness arguments applied
to the approximate solutions in the Eulerian coordinates.

subsequent steps operate within a new fuzzy 2-tuple framework that overcomes
previous FCM limitations through advanced processing methods, where large FCMs

assess policy solutions to address the problem. In this study, very large
cognitive maps were developed through interviews capturing perceptions of five
different stakeholder groups taking into consideration the causes, consequences
and challenges of the acute water scarcity problem in Jordan. The complex FCMs
containing 186 variables comprehensively covered all aspects of water scarcity.
FCMs were condensed into smaller maps in two levels. They were also combined
into five stakeholder group FCMs and one whole system FCM (total 123 FCMs).
AANN simulations of policy scenarios were conducted on the whole system FCM,
first at the most condensed level and then moved top-down through the next two
levels of granularity to explore potential solutions. These were ranked by a
novel fuzzy Appropriateness criterion to provide a number of high level and

them, online strategies have to be applied. For practical applications,
limitations in the computational resources for the adaptation of batch learning
algorithms, like the SVM, have to be considered.
  Approach: We review and compare several strategies for online learning with
SVMs. We focus on data selection strategies which limit the size of the stored
training data [...]
  Main Results: For different data shifts, different criteria are appropriate.
For the synthetic data, adding all samples to the pool of considered samples
performs often significantly worse than other criteria. Especially, adding only
misclassified samples performed astoundingly well. Here, balancing criteria
were very important when the other criteria were not well chosen. For the
transfer setups, the results show that the best strategy depends on the
intensity of the drift during the transfer. Adding all and removing the oldest
samples results in the best performance, whereas for smaller drifts, it can be
sufficient to only add potential new support vectors of the SVM which reduces
processing resources.
  Significance: For BCIs based on EEG models, trained on data from a
calibration session, a previous recording session, or even from a recording
session with one or several other subjects, are used. This transfer of the
learned model usually decreases the performance and can therefore benefit from
online learning which adapts the classifier like the established SVM. We show
that by using the right combination of data selection criteria, it is possible
to adapt the classifier and largely increase the performance. Furthermore, in
some cases it is possible to speed up the processing and save computational by
updating with a subset of special samples and keeping a small subset of samples
for training the classifier.

variations to solve ghosting. For the local branch, we design a local context

attention mechanism to select informative local details across the extracted
features to complement the global branch. By incorporating the CA-ViT as basic
components, we further build the HDR-Transformer, a hierarchical network to

key idea is to systematically extract all structural and enthalpic properties

them in dependence of the acyl chain order parameters. Detailed interpretation
is simplified by the observation that, to a good approximation, the interaction
effects do not depend on the total CHOL concentration, but only on the local
CHOL arrangement. The resulting information can be used to motivate the
agglomeration of CHOL molecules, the relevance of entropic rather than

verified that the interaction functions hardly change during the transition

with global-local shrinkage priors for estimating monotone function values.
Specifically, we introduce half shrinkage priors for positive valued random
variables and assign them for the first order differences of function values.
We also develop fast and simple Gibbs sampling algorithms for full posterior
analysis. By incorporating advanced shrinkage priors, the proposed method is
adaptive to local abrupt changes or jump in target functions. We show this
adaptive property theoretically by proving that the posterior mean estimators
are robust to large differences and asymptotic risk for unchanged points can be
improved. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed methods through simulations and
applications to a real data set.

  Cleft Palate Speech","Accepted by InterSpeech 2022",,,,"eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Hypernasality is an abnormal resonance in human speech production, especially
in patients with craniofacial anomalies such as cleft palate. In clinical
application, hypernasality estimation is crucial in cleft palate diagnosis, as
its results determine the subsequent surgery and additional speech therapy.
Therefore, designing an automatic hypernasality assessment method will
facilitate speech-language pathologists to make precise diagnoses. Existing
methods for hypernasality estimation only conduct acoustic analysis based on
low-resource cleft palate dataset, by using statistical or neural network-based
features. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses automatic speech
recognition model to improve hypernasality estimation. Specifically, we first
pre-train an encoder-decoder framework in an automatic speech recognition (ASR)
objective by using speech-to-text dataset, and then fine-tune ASR encoder on
the cleft palate dataset for hypernasality estimation. Benefiting from such
design, our model for hypernasality estimation can enjoy the advantages of ASR
model: 1) compared with low-resource cleft palate dataset, the ASR task usually
includes large-scale speech data in the general domain, which enables better
model generalization; 2) the text annotations in ASR dataset guide model to
extract better acoustic features. Experimental results on two cleft palate
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared
with previous approaches.

find clearly a rich population of intracluster GCs that spread in a wide area
of the cluster. Their ages, considering the cluster redshift, are younger than
9.5 Gyr. The F200W (AB) magnitudes of these GCs, $26.5<{F200W_0} <29.5$ mag,
correspond to $-15.2<{M_{F200W}} <-12.2$ mag, showing that they belong to the
brightest GCs (including ultracompact dwarfs). The spatial distributions of
these GCs show a megaparsec-scale structure elongated along the major axis of
the brightest cluster galaxy. In addition, they show a large number of
substructures, some of which are consistent with the substructures seen in the
map of diffuse intracluster light. The GC number density map is, in general,
consistent with the dark matter mass density map based on the strong lensing
analysis in the literature. The radial number density profile of the GCs in the
outer region is steeper than the dark matter mass profile obtained from lensing
models. These results are consistent with those for the GCs found in the deep
HST images of Abell 2744, another massive cluster at $z=0.308$, and in

gender, race, etc. Deployment of such algorithms to domains such as hiring,
healthcare, law enforcement, etc. has raised serious concerns about fairness,
accountability, trust and interpretability in machine learning algorithms. To
alleviate this problem, we propose D-BIAS, a visual interactive tool that
embodies human-in-the-loop AI approach for auditing and mitigating social
biases from tabular datasets. It uses a graphical causal model to represent
causal relationships among different features in the dataset and as a medium to
inject domain knowledge. A user can detect the presence of bias against a
group, say females, or a subgroup, say black females, by identifying unfair
causal relationships in the causal network and using an array of fairness
metrics. Thereafter, the user can mitigate bias by acting on the unfair causal
edges. For each interaction, say weakening/deleting a biased causal edge, the
system uses a novel method to simulate a new (debiased) dataset based on the
current causal model. Users can visually assess the impact of their
interactions on different fairness metrics, utility metrics, data distortion,
and the underlying data distribution. Once satisfied, they can download the
debiased dataset and use it for any downstream application for fairer
predictions. We evaluate D-BIAS by conducting experiments on 3 datasets and
also a formal user study. We found that D-BIAS helps reduce bias significantly
compared to the baseline debiasing approach across different fairness metrics
while incurring little data distortion and a small loss in utility. Moreover,
our human-in-the-loop based approach significantly outperforms an automated
approach on trust, interpretability and accountability.

capillary pressure is a strictly decreasing function near the equilibrium,
namely, $f'(1)<0$, Evje-Wang-Wen established global stability of the constant
equilibrium state for the three-dimensional Cauchy problem under some smallness
assumptions. Recently, Wu-Yao-Zhang proved global stability of the constant
equilibrium state for the case $P^+=P^-$ (corresponding to $f'(1)=0$). In this
work, we investigate the instability of the constant equilibrium state for the
case that the capillary pressure is a strictly increasing function near the
equilibrium, namely, $f'(1)>0$. First, by employing Hodge decomposition
technique and making detailed analysis of the Green's function for the
corresponding linearized system, we construct solutions of the linearized
problem that grow exponentially in time in the Sobolev space $H^k$, thus
leading to a global instability result for the linearized problem. Moreover,
with the help of the global linear instability result and a local existence
theorem of classical solutions to the original nonlinear system, we can then
show the instability of the nonlinear problem in the sense of Hadamard by
making a delicate analysis on the properties of the semigroup. Therefore, our
result shows that for the case $f'(1)>0$, the constant equilibrium state of the
two-fluid model is linearly globally unstable and nonlinearly locally unstable
in the sense of Hadamard, which is in contrast to the cases $f'(1)<0$ and
$P^+=P^-$ (corresponding to $f'(1)=0$) where the constant equilibrium state of

existing methods for assessing parental origin effects do not incorporate any
covariates, which may be required to control for confounding factors. We
propose to model the parental origin effects through a logistic regression
model, with predictors including maternal and child genotypes, parental
origins, and covariates. The parental origins may not be fully inferred from
genotypes of a target genetic marker, so we propose to use genotypes of markers
tightly linked to the target marker to increase inference efficiency. A
computationally robust statistical inference procedure is developed based on a
modified profile likelihood in a retrospective way. A computationally feasible
expectation-maximization algorithm is devised to estimate all unknown
parameters involved in the modified profile likelihood. This algorithm differs
from the conventional expectation-maximization algorithm in the sense that it
is based on a modified instead of the original profile likelihood function. The
convergence of the algorithm is established under some mild regularity
conditions. This expectation-maximization algorithm also allows convenient
handling of missing child genotypes. Large sample properties, including weak
consistency, asymptotic normality, and asymptotic efficiency, are established
for the proposed estimator under some mild regularity conditions. Finite sample
properties are evaluated through extensive simulation studies and the

Reinforcement Learning (RL) to handle the dynamic evolution processes between
users and recommender systems. However, learning to train an optimal RL agent
is generally impractical with commonly sparse user feedback data in the context
of recommender systems. To circumvent the lack of interaction of current
RL-based recommender systems, we propose to learn a general Model-Agnostic
Counterfactual Synthesis (MACS) Policy for counterfactual user interaction data
augmentation. The counterfactual synthesis policy aims to synthesise
counterfactual states while preserving significant information in the original
state relevant to the user's interests, building upon two different training
approaches we designed: learning with expert demonstrations and joint training.
As a result, the synthesis of each counterfactual data is based on the current
recommendation agent's interaction with the environment to adapt to users'
dynamic interests. We integrate the proposed policy Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG), Soft Actor Critic (SAC) and Twin Delayed DDPG in an adaptive
pipeline with a recommendation agent that can generate counterfactual data to
improve the performance of recommendation. The empirical results on both online
simulation and offline datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalisation of our counterfactual synthesis policy and verify that it
improves the performance of RL recommendation agents.

the crossover probabilities are independent of the initial mode index (IMI). We
lay down a procedure that allows to retrieve full information in a state by
identifying invariant quantities. Finally, we construct quantum error
correction and rejection codes for idealised crosstalk channels, without any

final state particle production and smaller elliptic flow. The relative
difference between observables in centrality and spectator binning shows
reduced sensitivity for the observables dominated by impact parameter

has been observed to corroborate the DAMA/LIBRA signal. Many studies assuming
various dark matter models have attempted to reconcile DAMA/LIBRA's modulation
signals and null results from other experiments, however no clear conclusion
can be drawn. Apart from the dark matter hypothesis, several studies have
examined the possibility that the modulation is induced by variations in their
detector's environment or their specific analysis methods. In particular, a
recent study presents a possible cause of the annual modulation from an
analysis method adopted by the DAMA/LIBRA experiment in which the observed
annual modulation could be reproduced by a slowly varying time-dependent
background. Here, we study the COSINE-100 data using an analysis method similar
to the one adopted by the DAMA/LIBRA experiment and observe a significant
annual modulation, although the modulation phase is almost opposite to that of
the DAMA/LIBRA data. Assuming the same background composition for COSINE-100
and DAMA/LIBRA, simulated experiments for the DAMA/LIBRA without dark matter
signals also provide significant annual modulation with an amplitude similar to
DAMA/LIBRA with opposite phase. Even though this observation does not explain
the DAMA/LIBRA's results directly, this interesting phenomenon motivates deeper
studies of the time-dependent DAMA/LIBRA background data.

$G$. This function was introduced by Amiri, Amiri, and Isaacs in 2009 and they
proved that for any finite group $G$ of order $n$, $\psi(G)$ is maximum if and

of order $n$. Furthermore, Herzog, Longobardi, and Maj in 2018 proved that if
$G$ is non-cyclic, $\psi(G) \leq \frac{7}{11} \psi(\mathbb{Z}_n)$. Amiri and
Amiri in 2014 introduced the function $\psi_k(G)$ which is defined as the sum
of the $k$-th powers of element orders of $G$ and they showed that for every
positive integer $k$, $\psi_k(G)$ is also maximum if and only if $G$ is cyclic.

result of Herzog et al. as a simple corollary. Besides, a recursive formula for
$\psi_k(G)$ is also obtained for finite abelian $p$-groups $G$, using which one
can explicitly find out the exact value of $\psi_k(G)$ for finite abelian

the distribution of node visits created during the search. We evaluate the
quality of the generated samples with respect to human-composed pieces using a
set of objective metrics computed directly from the generated samples. We also
perform a user study to evaluate how human subjects perceive the generated

outperforms SBBS and CS in almost all metrics of music quality and emotion.

response to continuous control parameters like temperature or external fields.
Near continuous phase transitions, associated with the divergence of a
correlation length, universal power-law scaling behavior with critical
exponents independent of microscopic system details is found. Recently,
dynamical quantum phase transitions and universal scaling have been predicted
and also observed in the non-equilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum systems
after a quench, with time playing the role of the control parameter. However,
signatures of such dynamical phase transition in open systems, whose dynamics
is driven by the dissipative contact to an environment, were so far elusive.
Here, we demonstrate that dynamical phase transitions with respect to time can
also occur in open quantum systems described by mixed states. We experimentally
measure the relaxation dynamics of the large atomic spin of individual Caesium
atoms induced by the dissipative coupling via spin-exchange processes to an
ultracold Bose gas of Rubidium atoms. For initial states far from equilibrium,
the entropy of the spin state is found to peak in time, transiently approaching
its maximum possible value, before eventually relaxing to its lower equilibrium
value. This effect is associated with a prethermal loss of the system's memory
of the details of the initial state. Moreover, a finite-size scaling analysis
based on numerical simulations shows that it corresponds to a dynamical phase
transition of the dissipative system in the limit of large system sizes. Our
results show that dynamical phase transitions are not restricted to occur in
isolated systems, but, surprisingly, are possible also during the dissipative
evolution of open quantum systems.

inherently parallel quantum computing able to speed up the inherently parallel
ray tracing algorithm? The ray tracing problem can be regarded as a
high-dimensional numerical integration problem. Suppose $N$ queries are used,
classical Monte Carlo approaches has an error convergence of $O(1/\sqrt{N})$,
while the quantum supersampling algorithm can achieve an error convergence of
approximately $O(1/N)$. However, the outputs of the origin form of quantum
supersampling obeys a probability distribution that has a long tail, which
shows up as many detached abnormal noisy dots on images. In this paper, we
improve quantum supersampling by replacing the QFT-based phase estimation in
quantum supersampling with a robust quantum counting scheme, the QFT-based
adaptive Bayesian phase estimation. We quantitatively study and compare the
performances of different quantum counting schemes. Finally, we do simulation
experiments to show that the quantum ray tracing with improved quantum
supersampling does perform better than classical path tracing algorithm as well

large-scale models pose significant challenges for training under the current

often leverage model parameter dropout. However, manipulating individual model
parameters is not only inefficient in meaningfully reducing the communication
overhead when training large-scale FL models, but may also be detrimental to
the scaling efforts and model performance as shown by recent research. To
address these issues, we propose the Federated Opportunistic Block Dropout
(FedOBD) approach. The key novelty is that it decomposes large-scale models
into semantic blocks so that FL participants can opportunistically upload
quantized blocks, which are deemed to be significant towards training the
model, to the FL server for aggregation. Extensive experiments evaluating
FedOBD against four state-of-the-art approaches based on multiple real-world
datasets show that it reduces the overall communication overhead by more than
88% compared to the best performing baseline approach, while achieving the
highest test accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, FedOBD is the first
approach to perform dropout on FL models at the block level rather than at the
individual parameter level.

strength of the chromospheric emission lines. The light curves of $33$ ZAMS
stars in IC 2391 and IC 2602 were obtained from \textit{TESS} photometric data.
The light curves can be grouped into the following four categories: single
frequency, possible shape changer, beater, and complex variability. The
amplitudes of the light curves are $0.001-0.145\,\mathrm{mag}$, similar to
those of ZAMS stars in Pleiades. The starspot coverages are $0.1-21\%$. We
found that the light variations and Ca\,\emissiontype{II} emission line
strength of ZAMS stars in IC 2391, IC 2602, and the Pleiades cluster are as
large as those of the most active superflare stars and two orders larger than
those of the Sun, and are located on the extensions of the superflare stars.
These results suggest that superflare stars link the properties of the Sun to
those of the ZAMS stars of ages between $30$ and $120\,\mathrm{Myr}$. ZAMS
stars with a single frequency or possible shape change in the light curve tend
to have both large light variation, indicating large spot coverage, and
saturated Ca\,\emissiontype{II} emission line strength. ZAMS stars with beat or
complex variability have small spot coverage and a faint Ca\,\emissiontype{II}
emission line. We also detected $21$ flares in the \textit{TESS} light curves

With its many intriguing properties, such as a fractal eigenvalue spectrum, the
Fibonacci chain offers a rich platform to investigate many of the effects that
occur in three-dimensional quasicrystals. In this work, we study the
eigenvalues and eigenstates of two identical Fibonacci chains coupled to each
other in different ways. We find that this setup allows for a rich variety of
effects. Depending on the coupling scheme used, the resulting system (i)
possesses an eigenvalue spectrum featuring a richer hierarchical structure
compared to the spectrum of a single Fibonacci chain, (ii) shows a coexistence
of Bloch and critical eigenstates, or (iii) possesses a large number of
degenerate eigenstates, each of which is perfectly localized on only four sites
of the system. If additionally, the system is infinitely extended, the
macroscopic number of perfectly localized eigenstates induces a perfectly flat
quasi band. Especially the second case is interesting from an application
perspective, since eigenstates that are of Bloch or of critical character
feature largely different transport properties. At the same time, the proposed
setup allows for an experimental realization, e.g., with evanescently coupled

  Problem","10 pages, 9 figures",,,,"quant-ph cs.DS math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we propose a novel method of formulating an NP-hard wireless
channel assignment problem as a higher order unconstrained binary optimization
(HUBO), where the Grover adaptive search (GAS) is used to provide a quadratic
speedup for solving the problem. The conventional method relies on a one-hot
encoding of the channel indices, resulting in a quadratic formulation. By
contrast, we conceive ascending and descending binary encodings of the channel
indices, construct a specific quantum circuit, and derive the exact numbers of
qubits and gates required by GAS. Our analysis clarifies that the proposed HUBO
formulation significantly reduces the number of qubits and the query complexity
compared with the conventional quadratic formulation. This advantage is
achieved at the cost of an increased number of quantum gates, which we
demonstrate can be reduced by our proposed descending binary encoding.

intelligibility for hearing impaired and non native listeners and even for the

performance of machine listening applications. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach of binaural dereverberation of a single speech source, using the
differences in the interaural cues of the direct path signal and the
reverberations. Two beamformers, spaced at an interaural distance, are used to
extract the reverberations from the reverberant speech. The interaural cues
generated by these reverberations and those generated by the direct path signal
act as a two class dataset, used for the training of U-Net (a deep
convolutional neural network). After its training, the beamformers are removed
and the trained U-Net along with the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
algorithm is used to discriminate between the direct path cues from the
reverberation cues, when the system is exposed to the interaural spectrogram of
the reverberant speech signal. Our proposed model has outperformed the
classical signal processing dereverberation model weighted prediction error in
terms of cepstral distance (CEP), frequency weighted segmental signal to noise
ratio (FWSEGSNR) and signal to reverberation modulation energy ratio (SRMR) by
1.4 points, 8 dB and 0.6dB. It has achieved better performance than the deep
learning based dereverberation model by gaining 1.3 points improvement in CEP

require access to both source data and source model parameters for adaptation,
raising serious data privacy and model portability issues. To cope with the
above concerns, this paper firstly formulates Black-box Video Domain Adaptation
(BVDA) as a more realistic yet challenging scenario where the source video
model is provided only as a black-box predictor. While a few methods for
Black-box Domain Adaptation (BDA) are proposed in image domain, these methods
cannot apply to video domain since video modality has more complicated temporal
features that are harder to align. To address BVDA, we propose a novel Endo and
eXo-TEmporal Regularized Network (EXTERN) by applying mask-to-mix strategies
and video-tailored regularizations: endo-temporal regularization and
exo-temporal regularization, performed across both clip and temporal features,
while distilling knowledge from the predictions obtained from the black-box
predictor. Empirical results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of
EXTERN across various cross-domain closed-set and partial-set action

  Duration Bias","Accepted by MM'22",,"10.1145/3503161.3548428",,"cs.IR cs.MM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recommender systems are prone to be misled by biases in the data. Models
trained with biased data fail to capture the real interests of users, thus it
is critical to alleviate the impact of bias to achieve unbiased recommendation.
In this work, we focus on an essential bias in micro-video recommendation,
duration bias. Specifically, existing micro-video recommender systems usually
consider watch time as the most critical metric, which measures how long a user
watches a video. Since videos with longer duration tend to have longer watch
time, there exists a kind of duration bias, making longer videos tend to be
recommended more against short videos. In this paper, we empirically show that
commonly-used metrics are vulnerable to duration bias, making them NOT suitable
for evaluating micro-video recommendation. To address it, we further propose an
unbiased evaluation metric, called WTG (short for Watch Time Gain). Empirical
results reveal that WTG can alleviate duration bias and better measure
recommendation performance. Moreover, we design a simple yet effective model
named DVR (short for Debiased Video Recommendation) that can provide unbiased
recommendation of micro-videos with varying duration, and learn unbiased user
preferences via adversarial learning. Extensive experiments based on two
real-world datasets demonstrate that DVR successfully eliminates duration bias
and significantly improves recommendation performance with over 30% relative
progress. Codes and datasets are released at

Several dynamically cold streams have been associated with certain
globular clusters (GCs) based on orbital energies and angular momenta. Some of
these streams are surprisingly far apart from their progenitors and one such
pair is Triangulum and NGC 5824. Triangulum can be considered as a piece of NGC
5824 leading tail since the cluster's future orbit matches with the stream's
track well. The existence of the leading tail for NGC 5824 is the motivation
behind the search for its trailing tail. Aims. Our goal is to confirm the
connection between Triangulum and NGC 5824 and seek the trailing tail of the
cluster. Methods. The selection of member stars of Triangulum is made through
various cuts in metallicity, proper motions (PMs), radial velocity and
color-magnitude diagram (CMD). The selected members are compared in phase space
to a mock stream which models the disruption of NGC 5824. We then try to detect
the trailing tail of the cluster based on a modified matched-filter technique.
Stars are assigned weights using their color differences from the cluster's
locus in CMD. These weights are further scaled based on stars' departures from
expected PMs of the model stream. Results. A total of 26 member stars for
Triangulum are obtained and 16 of them are newly identified. These members are
consistent with the mock stream in the phase space and their metalicity and
position on the CMD are in good agreements with NGC 5824. By applying the
matched-filter, a tenuous trailing tail of the cluster is detected, spanning
$\sim$ 50$^\circ$ long on sky. The signature matches with the mock stream's
trajectory well. Conclusions. Our results support that Triangulum stream acts
as a part of the leading tail for NGC 5824. On the trailing side, we have
detected a 50$^\circ$ tail extended from the cluster. The existence of both
leading and trailing tails for the GC NGC 5824 is verified.

to properly reproduce dissociation energies, diatomic potentials, and
long-range interactions at all asymptotic channels, in addition to naturally
reflect the correct permutational symmetry of the potential. Bound vibrational

populations in time. Nevertheless, understanding community dynamics and its

time-series of taxonomically-rich bacterial communities, regarding their
potential ecological function, are needed. A key concept for organizing
ecological functions is the niche, the set of strategies that enable a
population to persist and define its impacts on the surroundings. Here we
present a framework based on manifold learning, to organize genomic information
into potentially occupied bacterial metabolic niches over time. We apply the
method to re-construct the dynamics of putatively occupied metabolic niches
using a long-term bacterial time-series from the Baltic Sea, the Linnaeus
Microbial Observatory (LMO). The results reveal a relatively low-dimensional
space of occupied metabolic niches comprising groups of taxa with similar
functional capabilities. Time patterns of occupied niches were strongly driven
by seasonality. Some metabolic niches were dominated by one bacterial taxon
whereas others were occupied by multiple taxa, and this depended on season.
These results illustrate the power of manifold learning approaches to advance
our understanding of the links between community composition and functioning in

The introduction of omnidirectional or wide-angle cameras has allowed for
events to be captured more completely, making it even more difficult for the
director to pick a good shot. In this paper, a system is presented that, given
multiple ultra-high resolution video streams of an event, can generate a
visually pleasing sequence of shots that manages to follow the relevant action
of an event. Due to the algorithm being general purpose, it can be applied to
most scenarios that feature humans. The proposed method allows for online

detection is used to detect humans and other objects of interest in the input
streams. Detected persons of interest, along with a set of rules based on
cinematic conventions, are used to determine which video stream to show and
what part of that stream is virtually framed. The user can provide a number of
settings that determine how these rules are interpreted. The system is able to

conditions in a changing world. This aspect has been studied intensively in
social dilemmas where competing players' individual and collective interests
are in conflict. Starting from the traditional public goods game model, where
players are locally fixed and unconditional cooperators or defectors are
present, we introduce two additional strategies through which agents can change
their positions of dependence on the local cooperation level. More importantly,
these so-called sophisticated players should bear an extra cost to maintain
their permanent capacity to evaluate their neighborhood and react accordingly.
Hence, four strategies compete, and the most successful one can be imitated by
its neighbors. Crucially, the introduction of costly movement has a highly
biased consequence on the competing main strategies. In the majority of
parameter space, it is harmful to defectors and provides a significantly higher
cooperation level when the population is rare. At an intermediate population
density, which would be otherwise optimal for a system of immobile players, the
presence of mobile actors could be detrimental if the interaction pattern
changes slightly, thereby blocking the optimal percolation of information flow.
In this parameter space, sophisticated cooperators can also show the co-called
Moor effect by first avoiding the harmful vicinity of defectors; they
subsequentially transform into an immobile cooperator state. Hence,
paradoxically, the additional cost of movement could be advantageous to reach a
higher general income, especially for a rare population when subgroups would be
isolated otherwise.

Instead of random sampling, we design Relation-Aware Sampling to preserve
relevant points to the given template during subsampling. 2) We propose a Point
Relation Transformer for effective feature aggregation and feature matching

results, we employ a novel Prediction Refinement Module to obtain the final

favorable properties of the Bird's-Eye View (BEV) of point clouds in capturing
object motion, we further design a more advanced framework named PTTR++, which
incorporates both the point-wise view and BEV representation to exploit their
complementary effect in generating high-quality tracking results. PTTR++
substantially boosts the tracking performance on top of PTTR with low

proposed. In MA-MRC, a fixed size memory stores a small number of samples in

demonstrate that we accurately recover the cosmological and galaxy-halo

galaxies' host halos. Furthermore, the constraining power in $\sigma_8$
increases by about a factor of $2$ when including scales smaller than $5$

case of software development (SD): ML models acquire properties and fulfill
requirements even without direct human interaction in a seemingly
uncontrollable manner. Nonetheless, the underlying processes can be described
in a formal way. We define a comprehensive SD process model for ML that
encompasses most tasks and artifacts described in the literature in a
consistent way. In addition to the production of the necessary artifacts, we
also focus on generating and validating fitting descriptions in the form of
specifications. We stress the importance of further evolving the ML model
throughout its life-cycle even after initial training and testing. Thus, we
provide various interaction points with standard SD processes in which ML often
is an encapsulated task. Further, our SD process model allows to formulate ML
as a (meta-) optimization problem. If automated rigorously, it can be used to
realize self-adaptive autonomous systems. Finally, our SD process model
features a description of time that allows to reason about the progress within
ML development processes. This might lead to further applications of formal
methods within the field of ML.

regions in videos. Deep convolution neural networks (CNN) showcase strong
capacity in coping with the audio-visual saliency prediction task. Due to
various factors such as shooting scenes and weather, there often exists
moderate distribution discrepancy between source training data and target
testing data. The domain discrepancy induces to performance degradation on
target testing data for CNN models. This paper makes an early attempt to tackle
the unsupervised domain adaptation problem for audio-visual saliency
prediction. We propose a dual domain-adversarial learning algorithm to mitigate
the domain discrepancy between source and target data. First, a specific domain
discrimination branch is built up for aligning the auditory feature
distributions. Then, those auditory features are fused into the visual features
through a cross-modal self-attention module. The other domain discrimination
branch is devised to reduce the domain discrepancy of visual features and
audio-visual correlations implied by the fused audio-visual features.
Experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that our method can relieve the
performance degradation caused by domain discrepancy.

large-scale inhomogeneity, a wealth of fine-scale structure through the
chromosphere and corona has been brought to light by high-resolution

represents inhomogeneity that is thought to be perpendicular to the local
magnetic fields. The implications of this form of inhomogeneity on wave
propagation is still being uncovered, but is known to fundamentally change the
nature of MHD wave modes. It also enables interesting physics to arise
including resonances, turbulence and instabilities. Here we review some of the
key insights into how the inhomogeneity influences Alfv\'enic wave propagation

dealing with the words not occurring during training (a.k.a. out-of-vocabulary
(OOV) words) have long been a fundamental challenge for NMT systems. The
predominant method to tackle this problem is Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) which
splits words, including OOV words, into sub-word segments. BPE has achieved
impressive results for a wide range of translation tasks in terms of automatic
evaluation metrics. While it is often assumed that by using BPE, NMT systems
are capable of handling OOV words, the effectiveness of BPE in translating OOV
words has not been explicitly measured. In this paper, we study to what extent
BPE is successful in translating OOV words at the word-level. We analyze the
translation quality of OOV words based on word type, number of segments,
cross-attention weights, and the frequency of segment n-grams in the training
data. Our experiments show that while careful BPE settings seem to be fairly
useful in translating OOV words across datasets, a considerable percentage of
OOV words are translated incorrectly. Furthermore, we highlight the slightly
higher effectiveness of BPE in translating OOV words for special cases, such as
named-entities and when the languages involved are linguistically close to each
other.

  Results Our literature review shows that PCR is the gold standard method for
MPXV detection. In addition, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and
recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) have been reported as alternatives
to PCR. Immunodiagnostics, whole particle detection, and image-based detection

we review the main computational tasks in such analysis: 1) identification of
cell cycle phases, 2) pseudotime inference, 3) identification and profiling of
cell cycle-related genes, 4) removing cell cycle effect, 5) identification and
analysis of the G0 (quiescent) cells. We review seventeen software packages

Despite huge progress achieved, none of the packages can produce complete and
reliable results with respect to all aforementioned tasks. One of the major
difficulties for existing packages is distinguishing between two patterns of
cell cycle transcriptomic dynamics: normal and characteristic for embryonic
stem cells (ESC), with the latter one shared by many cancer cell lines.
Moreover, some cell lines are characterized by a mixture of two subpopulations,
one following the standard and one ESC-like cell cycle, which makes the
analysis even more challenging. In conclusion, we discuss the difficulties of
the analysis of cell cycle-related single cell transcriptome and provide
certain guidelines for the use of the existing methods.

differential equations on mapped multipatch domains, extending the classical
theory of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) to discrete de Rham sequences
which are broken, i.e., fully discontinuous across the patch interfaces.
Following the Conforming/Nonconforming Galerkin (CONGA) schemes developed in
[http://dx.doi.org/10.1090/mcom/3079, arXiv:2109.02553, our approach is based
on: (i) the identification of a conforming discrete de Rham sequence with
stable commuting projection operators, (ii) the relaxation of the continuity
constraints between patches, and (iii) the construction of conforming
projections mapping back to the conforming subspaces, allowing to define
discrete differentials on the broken sequence.
  This framework combines the advantages of conforming FEEC discretizations
(e.g. commuting projections, discrete duality and Hodge-Helmholtz
decompositions) with the data locality and implementation simplicity of
interior penalty methods for discontinuous Galerkin discretizations. We apply
it to several initial- and boundary-value problems, as well as eigenvalue
problems arising in electromagnetics. In each case our formulations are shown
to be well posed thanks to an appropriate stabilization of the jumps across the
interfaces, and the solutions are extremely robust with respect to the
stabilization parameter.
  Finally we describe a construction using tensor-product splines on mapped
cartesian patches, and we detail the associated matrix operators. Our numerical
experiments confirm the accuracy and stability of this discrete framework, and
they allow us to verify that expected structure-preserving properties such as
divergence or harmonic constraints are respected to floating-point accuracy.

piston- and pressure-driven shocks are produced. We find that the hot tip cools
rapidly and disappears from coronal emission lines such as Fe XII $195$ and Fe
XIV $274$. Prolonged hot emission is produced by pre-existing loop material
heated by the shock and by thermal conduction from the shock. However, the
shapes and Doppler shifts of synthetic line profiles show significant
discrepancies with observations. Furthermore, spatially and temporally averaged
intensities are extremely low, suggesting that if the observed intensities from
the quiet Sun and active regions were solely due to type II spicules, one to
several orders of magnitude more spicules would be required than have been
reported in the literature. This conclusion applies strictly to the ejected
spicular material. We make no claims about emissions connected with waves or
coronal currents that may be generated during the ejection process and heat the
surrounding area.

multi-structure segmentation. Our solution is founded on the thriving nn-UNet
architecture using 3D full resolution U-net. Firstly, various hyperparameters
are modified for this particular task. Then, by doubling the number of filters
in 3D full resolution nnUNet architecture to achieve a larger network, we may
capture a greater receptive field. Finally, we include an axial attention
mechanism in the decoder, which can obtain global information during the
decoding stage to prevent the loss of local knowledge. Our modified nn-UNet

and image super-resolution, the degradation representations were widely used to
model the degradation process and handle complicated degradation patterns.
However, they are less explored in learning-based image deblurring as blur
kernel estimation cannot perform well in real-world challenging cases. We argue
that it is particularly necessary for image deblurring to model degradation
representations since blurry patterns typically show much larger variations
than noisy patterns or high-frequency textures.In this paper, we propose a
framework to learn spatially adaptive degradation representations of blurry
images. A novel joint image reblurring and deblurring learning process is
presented to improve the expressiveness of degradation representations. To make
learned degradation representations effective in reblurring and deblurring, we
propose a Multi-Scale Degradation Injection Network (MSDI-Net) to integrate
them into the neural networks. With the integration, MSDI-Net can handle
various and complicated blurry patterns adaptively. Experiments on the GoPro

the learned degradation representations outperforms state-of-the-art methods

letter reports an approach of engineering and enhancing the strength of oblique

(UMA) by simultaneous modification of film morphology as well as film texture.
To meet this objective, Cobalt film and Si substrate have been taken as a model
system. Unlike conventional post growth IBE of film, we direct our effort to
the sequential deposition and subsequent IBE of the film. Detailed in-situ
investigation insights that the film grows in highly biaxially textured
polycrystalline state with formation of nanometric surface ripples. The film
also exhibits pronounced UMA with easy axis oriented parallel to the surface
ripple direction. Remarkably, the induced UMA is about one order of magnitude
larger than the reported similar kind of earlier studies. The possibility of
imposing in-plane crystallographic texture giving rise to magneto-crystalline
anisotropy, along with long-range dipolar interaction throughout ripple crests
enhances the strength of the UMA. The present findings can be further extended
to systems characterized by different crystallographic structure and magnetic
properties and show the general applicability of the present method.

introduces the local self-attention features from the Swin Transformer blocks

the supersymmetric GUTs with gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking in
details. First, considering the dimension-six proton decay via heavy gauge
boson exchange, we point out that we can probe the supersymmetric GUTs with GUT
scale $M_{GUT}$ up to $1.778\times 10^{16}$ GeV at the Hyper-Kamiokande

bounds on the universal gaugino mass are $7.2$ TeV and 3.5 TeV, respectively,
and thus the corresponding upper bounds on gluino mass are 15 TeV and 8 TeV,
respectively. Also, we shall study the masses for charginos, neutralinos,
squarks, sleptons, and Higgs particles in details. In particular, the
supersymmetric GUTs with $M_{GUT} \leq 1.2\times 10^{16}$ GeV can be probed at
the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment, and the supersymmetric GUTs with $M_{GUT}\ge
1.2\times 10^{16}$ GeV can be probed at the future 100 TeV pp collider
experiments such as the ${\rm FCC}_{\rm hh}$ and SppC via gluino searches.
Thus, the supersymmetric GUTs with gravity mediation can be probed by the ${\rm
FCC}_{\rm hh}$, SppC, and Hyper-Kamiokande experiments. In our previous study,
we have shown that the supersymmetric GUTs with anomaly and gauge mediated
supersymmetry breakings are well within the reaches of these experiments.
Therefore, our proposal provides the concrete scientific goal for the ${\rm

supersymmetric GUTs.

Floquet bands via Bloch oscillations, by adding a tilted linear potential to
periodically driven lattice systems. The added linear field not only restricts
the spreading of a time-evolving wavepacket but also, depending on the ratio
between the Bloch oscillation frequency and the modulation frequency of the
periodic driving, dramatically modifies the band profile and topology.
Specifically, we consider a driven Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model as a working
example, in the presence of a linear field. Almost flat Floquet bands or
Floquet bands with large Chern numbers due to the interplay between the
periodic driving and Bloch oscillations can be obtained, with the band
structure and topology extensively tunable by adjusting the ratio of two
competing frequencies. To confirm our finding, we further execute the Thouless
pumping of one and two interacting bosons in such a lattice system and
establish its connection with the topological properties of single- and
two-particle Floquet bands.

enumerating and counting (WG 2022). It has been shown that minimal Roman
dominating functions can be enumerated with polynomial delay, contrasting what
is known about minimal dominating sets. The running time of the algorithm could
be estimated as $\mathcal{O}(1.9332^n)$ on general graphs of order $n$. In this
paper, we focus on special graph classes. More specifically, for chordal
graphs, we present an enumeration algorithm running in time
$\mathcal{O}(1.8940^n)$. For interval graphs, we can lower this time further to
$\mathcal{O}(1.7321^n)$. Interestingly, this also matches (exactly) the known
lower bound. We can also provide a matching lower and upper bound for forests,
which is (incidentally) the same, namely $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{3}^n)$.
Furthermore, we show an enumeration algorithm running in time
$\mathcal{O}(1.4656^n)$ for split graphs and for cobipartite graphs. Our

a sample with 5 nm thick SnTe layer, the data analysis suggests that midgap

with high degrees of freedom (DOFs) (or low-redundancy) and reduced mutual
coupling, which are the main features to improve the performance of
direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. A sensor array is called low-redundancy
if the ratio $R=N(N-1)/(2L)$ is approaching the Leech's bound $1.217\leq
R_{opt}\leq 1.332$, where $N$ is the physical sensor number and $L$ is the
maximum inter-sensor spacing of the sensor array. Up to now, the best known
infinite classes of low-redundancy arrays (LRAs) satisfy $R\leq1.5$. The
objective of this paper is to propose a new LRA configuration with $R<1.5$ for
any $N\geq18$. The new array preserves all the good properties of existing
sparse arrays, namely, the different co-array is hole-free, and the sensor
locations are uniquely determined by a closed-form expression as a function of
the number of sensors. Notably, compared to existing sparse arrays, the
proposed array can significantly reduce the effects of mutual coupling between
sensors, by decreasing the number of sensor pairs with minimum inter-spacing to
the lowest number 1. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the
superiority of the new array over other known sparse arrays.

pragmatic non-linear battery discharge for the battery of the UAV. Thus, we
formulate the problem in a novel manner that represents the maximization of a
fairness-based energy efficiency metric and is named fair energy efficiency
(FEE). The FEE metric defines a system that lays importance on both the
per-user service fairness and the energy efficiency of the PAP. The formulated
problem takes the form of a non-convex problem with non-tractable constraints.
To obtain a solution, we represent the problem as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP) with continuous state and action spaces. Considering the complexity of
the solution space, we use the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient
(TD3) actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to learn a
policy that maximizes the FEE of the system. We perform two types of RL
training to exhibit the effectiveness of our approach: the first (offline)
approach keeps the positions of the GNs the same throughout the training phase;
the second approach generalizes the learned policy to any arrangement of GNs by
changing the positions of GNs after each training episode. Numerical
evaluations show that neglecting the Peukert effect overestimates the air-time
of the PAP and can be addressed by optimally selecting the PAP's flying speed.
Moreover, the user fairness, energy efficiency, and hence the FEE value of the
system can be improved by efficiently moving the PAP above the GNs. As such, we
notice massive FEE improvements over baseline scenarios of up to 88.31%,
272.34%, and 318.13% for suburban, urban, and dense urban environments,

rate and feature spatial resolution, which results in a search space consisting
of about 2.78*10^324 possible choices. To handle such a large search space, we
leverage differential architecture search methods. However, the architecture
parameters searched using existing differential methods need to be discretized,
which causes the discretization gap between the architecture parameters found
by the differential methods and their discretized version as the final solution
for the architecture search. Hence, we relieve the problem of discretization
gap from the innovative perspective of solution space regularization.
Specifically, a novel Solution Space Regularization (SSR) loss is first
proposed to effectively encourage the supernet to converge to its discrete one.
Then, a new Hierarchical and Progressive Solution Space Shrinking method is
presented to further achieve high efficiency of searching. In addition, we
theoretically show that the optimization of SSR loss is equivalent to the
L_0-norm regularization, which accounts for the improved search-evaluation gap.
Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed search scheme can efficiently
find an optimal network structure that yields an extremely fast speed (175 FPS)

  Reconfigurations of vRANs","The manuscript has been submitted to IEEE for possible publication",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Virtualized Radio Access Networks (vRANs) are fully configurable and can be
implemented at low cost over commodity platforms offering unprecedented network
management flexibility. In this paper, a novel vRAN reconfiguration problem
with a deep reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework is proposed that
jointly reconfigures the functional splits of the base stations (BSs),
resources and locations of the virtualized central units (vCUs) and distributed
units (vDUs), and the routing for each BS flow. The objective is to minimize
the long-term total network operation cost while adapting to traffic demands
and resource availability. Testbed measurements are performed to study the
relations between traffic demands and computing resource utilization, which
reveal that their relations have high variance and dependence on platform and
platform load. Hence, acquiring the perfect model of the underlying system is
non-trivial. A comprehensive cost function is formulated that considers
resource overprovisioning, instantiation and reconfiguration and the declined
demands, where such impacts urge to perform the reconfigurations prudently.
Motivated by these insights, our solution framework is developed using
model-free RL. Since the formulated RL problem has a semi-continuous state and
discrete action space, Dueling Double Deep Q-network (D3QN)-based approach is
proposed. However, the system consists of multiple BSs with highly coupled
configurations sharing the same resources, which renders a multi-dimensional
discrete action space and drives combinatorial growth of the number of possible
actions. To overcome the curse of dimensionality, action branching, an action
decomposition method with a shared decision module followed by neural network
branches, is tailored with D3QN. Further, simulations are performed using O-RAN
compliant model and real traces of the testbed.

from a widely popular Cyber Attack known as Distributed Denial of Service

the computational capacity of services through the commands of an attacker.
This attack is made by leveraging the Domain Name System (DNS) technology

black-box nature of classifiers and make them interpretable and human-readable.
This work addresses the problem of Explainable ML in the context of botnet and

of crystals. Hence, even intense light pulses are not expected to break the
translation symmetry of materials. However, certain materials, including
KTaO$_3$, exhibit peaks in their Raman spectra corresponding to their Brillouin
zone boundary phonons due to second-order Raman processes, which provide a
mechanism to drive these phonons using intense midinfrared lasers. We
investigated the possibility of breaking the translation symmetry of KTaO$_3$
by driving its highest-frequency transverse optic mode $Q_{\textrm{HX}}$ at the
$X$ $(0,\frac{1}{2},0)$ point. Our first principles calculations show that the
energy curve of the transverse acoustic mode $Q_{\textrm{LZ}}$ at $X$ softens
and develops a double-well shape as the value of the $Q_{\textrm{HX}}$
coordinate is increased, while that of the other transverse acoustic component
$Q_{\textrm{LX}}$ hardens when the value of the $Q_{\textrm{HX}}$ coordinate is
similarly varied. We performed similar total energy calculations as a function
of the $Q_{\textrm{HX}}$ coordinate and electric field to extract the nonlinear
coupling between them. These were then used to construct the coupled equations
of motion for the three phonon coordinates in the presence of an external pump
term on the $Q_{\textrm{HX}}$ mode, which we numerically solved for a range of
pump frequencies and amplitudes. We find that 465 MV/cm is the smallest pump
amplitude that leads to an oscillation of the $Q_{\textrm{LZ}}$ mode at a
displaced position, hence, breaking the translation symmetry of the material.
Such highly intense light pulses cannot be generate by currently available
laser sources, and they have the possibility to damage the material.
Nevertheless, our work shows that light can in principle be used to break the
translation symmetry of a material via nonlinear phononics.

including constrained maximum-likelihood, the original GAMLSS algorithm, and
transformation trees. Parameter interpretability in the resulting models is
closely connected to model selection. We propose the application of a novel
best subset selection procedure to achieve especially simple ways of

Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array ^{12}CO(2-1) observations. We find two distinct
regions in NGC 404: a gravitationally-stable central region (Toomre parameter
Q=3-30) and a gravitationally-unstable molecular ring (Q<=1). The molecular
structures in the central region have a steeper size -- linewidth relation and
larger virial parameters than those in the molecular ring, suggesting gas is
more turbulent in the former. In the molecular ring, clumps exhibit a shallower
mass -- size relation and larger virial parameters than clouds, implying
density structures and dynamics are regulated by different physical mechanisms
at different spatial scales. We construct an analytical model of clump-clump
collisions to explain the results in the molecular ring. We propose that
clump-clump collisions are driven by gravitational instabilities coupled with
galactic shear, that lead to a population of clumps whose accumulation lengths
(i.e. average separations) are approximately equal to their tidal radii. Our
model-predicted clump masses and sizes (and mass -- size relation) and
turbulence energy injection rates (and size -- linewidth relation) match the
observations in the molecular ring very well, suggesting clump-clump collisions
is the main mechanism regulating clump properties and gas turbulence in that

where turbulence is likely driven by clump migration.

model which is based on van der Waals theory of capillarity. Diffuse interface
methods have gained much interest to model two-phase flow in porous media.
However, for the numerical solution of the NSK equations two major challenges
have to be faced. First, an extended numerical stencil is required due to a
third-order term in the linear momentum and the total energy equations. In
addition, the dispersive contribution in the linear momentum equations prevents
the straightforward use of contact angle boundary conditions. Secondly, any
real gas equation of state is based on a non-convex Helmholtz free energy
potential which may cause the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the first-order
fluxes to become imaginary numbers inside the spinodal region. In this work, a
thermodynamically consistent relaxation model is presented which is used to
approximate the NSK equations. The model is complimented by thermodynamically
consistent non-equilibrium boundary conditions which take contact angle effects
into account. Due to the relaxation approach, the contribution of the Korteweg
tensor in the linear momentum and total energy equations can be reduced to
second-order terms which enables a straightforward implementation of contact
angle boundary conditions in a numerical scheme. Moreover, the definition of a
modified pressure function enables to formulate first-order fluxes which remain
strictly hyperbolic in the entire spinodal region. The present work is a
generalization of a previously presented parabolic relaxation model for the
isothermal NSK equations.

inspiration from the precursor arXiv:0808.1419 [hep-th]. A distinguished class
of the corresponding backgrounds (supertargets with additional bicategorial
supergeometric data), organised into simplicial hierarchies, is considered. To
these, configurational (super)symmetry of the bulk field theory is lifted
coherently, whereby the notion of a maximally (super)symmetric background, and
in particular that of a simplicial Lie background, arises as the target
structure requisite for the definition of the super-$\sigma$-model with defects
fully transmissive to the currents of the bulk (super)symmetry. The formal
concepts are illustrated in two settings of physical relevance: that of the WZW
$\sigma$-model of the bosonic string in a compact simple 1-connected Lie group
and that of the GS super-$\sigma$-model of the superstring in the Minkowski
super-space. In the former setting, the structure of the background is fixed
through a combination of simplicial, symmetry(-reducibility) and cohomological
arguments, and a novel link between fusion of the maximally symmetric WZW
defects of Fuchs et al. and the 3$d$ CS theory with timelike Wilson lines with
fixed holonomy is established. Moreover, a purely geometric interpretation of
the Verlinde fusion rules is proposed. In the latter setting, a multiplicative
structure compatible with supersymmetry is shown to exist on the GS
super-1-gerbe of arXiv:1706.05682 [hep-th], and subsequently used in a novel
construction of a class of maximally (rigidly) supersymmetric bi-branes whose

which in turn has profound effects on the outflow properties. All of the
evolved configurations collapse to a black hole (BH) $\sim 21-23$ ms after the
onset of the simulations, however, the ones forming jets may be considerably
more effective at transporting angular momentum out of the system, resulting in
earlier collapse times. Larger mass ejecta rates and radial velocities of

probability mass function represented by its primal normal factor graph to the
corresponding marginal probabilities in its dual normal factor graph. The
mapping is based on the Fourier transform of the local factors of the models.
Details of the mapping are provided for the Ising model, where it is proved
that the local extrema of the fixed points are attained at the phase transition
of the two-dimensional nearest-neighbor Ising model. The results are further
extended to the Potts model, to the clock model, and to Gaussian Markov random
fields. By employing the mapping, we can transform simultaneously all the
estimated marginal probabilities from the dual domain to the primal domain (and
vice versa), which is advantageous if estimating the marginals can be carried
out more efficiently in the dual domain. An example of particular significance
is the ferromagnetic Ising model in a positive external magnetic field. For
this model, there exists a rapidly mixing Markov chain (called the
subgraphs--world process) to generate configurations in the dual normal factor
graph of the model. Our numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed
procedure can provide more accurate estimates of marginal probabilities of a
global probability mass function in various settings.

((Al,Ga)N) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their

window. However, current state-of-the-art (Al,Ga)N light emitters exhibit very
low internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs). Therefore, understanding the
fundamental electronic and optical properties of (Al,Ga)N-based quantum wells
is key to improving the IQE. Here, we target the electronic and optical
properties of c-plane Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N/AlN quantum wells by means of an
empirical atomistic tight-binding model. Special attention is paid to the
impact of random alloy fluctuations on the results as well as the aluminium
content x in the well. We find that across the studied Al content range (from
10% to 75% Al) strong hole wave function localization effects are observed.
Additionally, with increasing Al content, electron wave functions start also to
exhibit carrier localization features. Overall, our investigations on the
electronic structure of c-plane Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N/AlN quantum wells reveal that
already random alloy fluctuations are sufficient to lead to (strong) carrier
localization effects. Furthermore, our results indicate that random alloy
fluctuations impact the degree of optical polarization in c-plane
Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N quantum wells. We find that the switching from transverse
electric to transverse magnetic light polarization occurs at higher Al contents
in the atomistic calculation, which accounts for random alloy fluctuations,
when compared to the outcome of widely used virtual crystal approximations.
This observation is important for light extraction efficiencies in
(Al,Ga)N-based light emitting diodes operating in the deep UV.

H to Earth's atmosphere, likely has been to Venus's atmosphere, and may be for

two assumptions: either that atmospheric speciation is set by the
high-temperature equilibrium of volcanism; or, that volcanic gases
thermochemically re-equilibrate to the new, lower, temperature of the surface
environment. In the latter case it has been suggested that volcanic atmospheres
may create biosignature false positives. Here, we test the assumptions
underlying such inferences by performing chemical kinetic calculations to
estimate the relaxation timescale of volcanically-derived atmospheres to
thermochemical equilibrium, in a simple 0D atmosphere neglecting photochemistry
and reaction catalysis. We demonstrate that for planets with volcanic
atmospheres, thermochemical equilibrium over geological timescales can only be
assumed if the atmospheric temperature is above ~700K. Slow chemical kinetics
at lower temperatures inhibit the relaxation of redox-sensitive species to
low-temperature thermochemical equilibrium, precluding the production of two
independent biosignatures through thermochemistry alone: 1. ammonia, and 2. the
co-occurrence of CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ in an atmosphere in the absence of CO. This
supports the use of both biosignatures for detecting life. Quenched at the high
temperature of their degassing, volcanic gases also have speciations
characteristic of those produced from a more oxidized mantle, if interpreted as
being at thermochemical equilibrium. This therefore complicates linking
atmospheres to the interiors of rocky exoplanets, even when their atmospheres
are purely volcanic in origin.

  Learning",,,,,"physics.bio-ph cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Inverse design of short single-stranded RNA and DNA sequences (aptamers) is
the task of finding sequences that satisfy a set of desired criteria. Relevant
criteria may be, for example, the presence of specific folding motifs, binding
to molecular ligands, sensing properties, etc. Most practical approaches to
aptamer design identify a small set of promising candidate sequences using
high-throughput experiments (e.g. SELEX), and then optimize performance by
introducing only minor modifications to the empirically found candidates.
Sequences that possess the desired properties but differ drastically in
chemical composition will add diversity to the search space and facilitate the
discovery of useful nucleic acid aptamers. Systematic diversification protocols
are needed. Here we propose to use an unsupervised machine learning model known
as the Potts model to discover new, useful sequences with controllable sequence
diversity. We start by training a Potts model using the maximum entropy
principle on a small set of empirically identified sequences unified by a
common feature. To generate new candidate sequences with a controllable degree
of diversity, we take advantage of the model's spectral feature: an energy
bandgap separating sequences that are similar to the training set from those
that are distinct. By controlling the Potts energy range that is sampled, we
generate sequences that are distinct from the training set yet still likely to
have the encoded features. To demonstrate performance, we apply our approach to
design diverse pools of sequences with specified secondary structure motifs in
30-mer RNA and DNA aptamers.

instrumental variables literature. This assumption signifies that treatment
effects are constant across all subjects. It allows to interpret instrumental
variable estimates as average treatment effects over the whole population of

variable estimators can be larger than that of naive estimators ignoring
endogeneity. This paper develops two tests for the assumption of homogeneous
treatment effects when the treatment is endogenous and an instrumental variable
is available. The tests leverage a covariable that is (jointly with the error
terms) independent of a coordinate of the instrument. This covariate does not
need to be exogenous. The first test assumes that the potential outcomes are
linear in the regressors and is computationally simple. The second test is
nonparametric and relies on Tikhonov regularization. The treatment can be
either discrete or continuous. We show that the tests have asymptotically
correct level and asymptotic power equal to one against a range of

finite sample performances. The methodology is also applied to the evaluation

paper we provide a systematic review of the state-of-the-art on clustering
public transport users based on their temporal or spatial-temporal

inter-personal variability of travel patterns. We synthesize the key analysis

characterization of users' travel patterns; (iv) from demand analytics towards

fields strong enough to completely polarize the electrons' spins, thus making
the electron system ""spinless"". In both cases, the resistivity on the metallic
side near the transition increases with decreasing temperature, reaches a
maximum at a temperature $T_{\text{max}}$, and then decreases. The decrease
reaches more than an order of magnitude in zero magnetic field. The value of
$T_{\text{max}}$ in zero magnetic field is found to be close to the
renormalized Fermi temperature. However, rather than increasing along with the
Fermi temperature, the value $T_{\text{max}}$ decreases appreciably for
spinless electrons in spin-polarizing magnetic fields. The observed behavior of
$T_{\text{max}}$ cannot be described by existing theories. The results indicate
the spin-related origin of the effect. At the same time, the low-temperature

where a third material is separated from a background of two other materials,
in a case where none of the materials have a K-edge in the range of considered

random and realistic tissue variability.
  Results: Inclusion of a third basis function improves the quantitative

squared error in the resulting image.

decomposition is essential for the studied imaging task and could have
potential application for quantitative estimation of iron concentration from

identically distributed $p$-dimensional random vectors in the null-case. The
main result of this paper is an expansion of trace moments and power-trace
covariances of $S_{p,n}$ simultaneously for both high- and low-dimensional
data. To this end we develop a graph theory oriented ansatz of describing trace
moments as weighted sums over colored graphs. Specifically, explicit formulas
for the highest order coefficients in the expansion are deduced by restricting
attention to graphs with either no or one cycle. The novelty is a
color-preserving decomposition of graphs into a tree-structure and their seed
graphs, which allows for the identification of Euler circuits from graphs with
the same tree-structure but different seed graphs. This approach may also be
used to approximate the mean and covariance to even higher degrees of accuracy.

suggest linear models are hegemonic among Social Sciences. First, there is a
high and growing prevalence of linear-model-based research. Second, global
patterns of linear-model-based research prevalence align with global
inequalities in knowledge production. Third, there was a citation premium to
linear-model-based research until 2012 for articles' number of citations and
for the entire period in terms of having at least one citation. Previous

with long structures like limb arteries. To realize this characteristic, we
proposed a vision-based system to monitor the subject's movement and
automatically update the scan trajectory thus seamlessly obtaining a complete
3D image of the target anatomy. The motion monitoring module is developed using
the segmented object masks from RGB images. Once the subject is moved, the
robot will stop and recompute a suitable trajectory by registering the surface
point clouds of the object obtained before and after the movement using the
iterative closest point algorithm. Afterward, to ensure optimal contact
conditions after repositioning US probe, a confidence-based fine-tuning process
is used to avoid potential gaps between the probe and contact surface. Finally,
the whole system is validated on a human-like arm phantom with an uneven

be significantly enhanced by turbulence. Whether particles collide depends on
their flow history, in particular on their encounters with highly intermittent
small-scale turbulent structures, which despite their rarity can dominate the
overall collision rate. Intuitively, strong vortices may act as slings for
inertial particles, leading to intersections where several streams of particles
collide at large velocities. Here, we develop a quantitative criterion for
sling events based on the velocity gradient history along particle paths. We
demonstrate by combination of theory and simulations that the problem reduces
to a one-dimensional localization problem as encountered in condensed matter
physics. The reduction demonstrates that the creation of slings is completely
controlled by the smallest negative eigenvalue of the velocity gradient tensor.
We use fully resolved turbulence simulations to confirm our predictions and
study their Stokes and Reynolds number dependence. We also discuss
extrapolations to the parameter range relevant in clouds, showing that sling
events at high Reynolds numbers are significantly enhanced for small Stokes
numbers.

to estimate the probability of rare events for complex physical systems. Given
a sequence of nested failure domains of increasing size, the rare event
probability is expressed as a product of conditional probabilities. The
proposed new estimator uses different model resolutions and varying numbers of
samples across the hierarchy of nested failure sets. In order to dramatically
reduce the computational cost, we construct the intermediate failure sets such
that only a small number of expensive high-resolution model evaluations are
needed, whilst the majority of samples can be taken from inexpensive
low-resolution simulations. A key idea in our new estimator is the use of a
posteriori error estimators combined with a selective mesh refinement strategy
to guarantee the critical subset property that may be violated when changing
model resolution from one failure set to the next. The efficiency gains and the
statistical properties of the estimator are investigated both theoretically via
shaking transformations, as well as numerically. On a model problem from
subsurface flow, the new multilevel estimator achieves gains of more than a
factor 200 over standard subset simulation for a practically relevant relative
error of 25%.

involves the dc voltages ($\textit{V}_\textrm{dc}$) not only through the AMR

changes coming from both AMR and GMR should be taken into account to correctly
understand the characteristic field angular dependence of

the capacity $B$ of a knapsack. Previous works show competitive ratios of

$1/6.65$ (Albers, Khan, and Ladewig; APPROX 2019) for the general problem but
no definitive answers for the achievable competitive ratio; the best known
impossibility remains $1/e$ as inherited from the classic secretary problem. In
an effort to make more qualitative progress, we take an orthogonal approach and
give definitive answers for special cases.
  Our main result is on the $1$-$2$-knapsack secretary problem, the special
case in which $B=2$ and all items have sizes $1$ or $2$, arguably the simplest
meaningful generalization of the secretary problem towards the knapsack
secretary problem. Our algorithm is simple: It $\textit{boosts}$ the value of
size-$1$ items by a factor $\alpha>1$ and then uses the size-oblivious approach
by Albers, Khan, and Ladewig. We show by a nontrivial analysis that this
algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $1/e$ if and only if
$1.40\lesssim\alpha\leq e/(e-1)\approx 1.58$.
  Towards understanding the general case, we then consider the case when sizes
are $1$ and $B$, and $B$ is large. While it remains unclear if $1/e$ can be
achieved in that case, we show that algorithms based only on the relative ranks

address this challenge, this paper proposes a vision-based approach allowing

acquisition. To effectively segment and accurately reconstruct the targeted 3D

incorporating channel attention modules into a U-Net-type neural network. The
automatic trajectory generation method is evaluated on six volunteers with
various articulated joint angles. In all cases, the system can successfully
acquire the planned vascular structure on volunteers' limbs. For one volunteer
the MRI scan was also available, which allows the evaluation of the average
radius of the scanned artery from US images, resulting in a radius estimation

securing face biometric systems from presentation attacks (PAs) and vicious
digital manipulation (e.g., deepfakes). Despite promising performance upon
large-scale data and powerful deep models, the generalization problem of
existing approaches is still an open issue. Most of recent approaches focus on
1) unimodal visual appearance or physiological (i.e., remote
photoplethysmography (rPPG)) cues; and 2) separated feature representation for
FAS or face forgery detection. On one side, unimodal appearance and rPPG
features are respectively vulnerable to high-fidelity face 3D mask and video
replay attacks, inspiring us to design reliable multi-modal fusion mechanisms
for generalized face attack detection. On the other side, there are rich common
features across FAS and face forgery detection tasks (e.g., periodic rPPG
rhythms and vanilla appearance for bonafides), providing solid evidence to
design a joint FAS and face forgery detection system in a multi-task learning
fashion. In this paper, we establish the first joint face spoofing and forgery
detection benchmark using both visual appearance and physiological rPPG cues.
To enhance the rPPG periodicity discrimination, we design a two-branch
physiological network using both facial spatio-temporal rPPG signal map and its
continuous wavelet transformed counterpart as inputs. To mitigate the modality
bias and improve the fusion efficacy, we conduct a weighted batch and layer
normalization for both appearance and rPPG features before multi-modal fusion.
We find that the generalization capacities of both unimodal (appearance or
rPPG) and multi-modal (appearance+rPPG) models can be obviously improved via
joint training on these two tasks. We hope this new benchmark will facilitate
the future research of both FAS and deepfake detection communities.

solution for surface pressure spectrum can be specified using the non-linear

surface pressure can be directly related to the vorticity in the flow. The
results are checked against a Direct Numerical Simulation of a channel flow
configuration. It is shown that the vorticity associated with the wall shear
stress decays rapidly over a distance of about seven wall units and so the
outer vorticity dominates in the majority of the flow. The vorticity
correlation functions are evaluated and it is shown that the length scale of
the vorticity normal the wall is only about ten wall units so the flow can be
modeled as the superposition of uncorrelated vortex sheets. Finally a model for
the surface pressure wave number spectrum is developed by modeling the
vorticity spectrum based on the distribution of root mean square (rms)
vorticity in the flow, and an integral length scale that is about ten wall
units. Using inputs from the numerical simulation, a good fit to existing

simultaneously, sharing the same frequency and time resources. The detailed
working process of the proposed IRS-based ISAC system is designed, including
the transmission protocol, location sensing and beamforming optimization.
Specifically, each coherence block consists of two periods, the ISAC period
with two time blocks and the pure communication (PC) period. During each time
block of the ISAC period, data transmission and user positioning are carried
out simultaneously. The estimated user location in the first time block will be
used for beamforming design in the second time block. During the PC period,
only data transmission is conducted, by invoking the user location estimated in
the second time block of the ISAC period for beamforming design.
{\color{black}Simulation results show that a millimeter-level positioning
accuracy can be achieved by the proposed location sensing scheme, demonstrating
the advantage of the proposed IRS-based ISAC framework. Besides, the proposed
two beamforming schemes based on the estimated location information achieve
similar performance to the benchmark schemes assuming perfect channel state

different solvers, rigorous coupled-wave analysis and a finite-difference

several synthetic examples as well as the design of a 1550 nm filter and
anti-reflection coating. Results match experimental baselines, other simulation

which is a crucial task for computer-aided drug discovery. The goal of
single-step retrosynthesis is to identify the possible reactants that lead to
the synthesis of the target product in one reaction. By representing organic
molecules as canonical strings, existing sequence-based retrosynthetic methods
treat the product-to-reactant retrosynthesis as a sequence-to-sequence
translation problem. However, most of them struggle to identify diverse
chemical reactions for a desired product due to the deterministic inference,
which contradicts the fact that many compounds can be synthesized through
various reaction types with different sets of reactants. In this work, we aim
to increase reaction diversity and generate various reactants using discrete
latent variables. We propose a novel sequence-based approach, namely
RetroDVCAE, which incorporates conditional variational autoencoders into
single-step retrosynthesis and associates discrete latent variables with the
generation process. Specifically, RetroDVCAE uses the Gumbel-Softmax
distribution to approximate the categorical distribution over potential
reactions and generates multiple sets of reactants with the variational
decoder. Experiments demonstrate that RetroDVCAE outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines on both benchmark dataset and homemade dataset. Both quantitative and
qualitative results show that RetroDVCAE can model the multi-modal distribution
over reaction types and produce diverse reactant candidates.

weakness of deep networks for semantic segmentation. Previous studies relied on
the assumption of a static model, i.e. once the training process is complete,
model parameters remain fixed at test time. In this work, we challenge this
premise with a self-adaptive approach for semantic segmentation that adjusts
the inference process to each input sample. Self-adaptation operates on two
levels. First, it employs a self-supervised loss that customizes the parameters
of convolutional layers in the network to the input image. Second, in Batch
Normalization layers, self-adaptation approximates the mean and the variance of
the entire test data, which is assumed unavailable. It achieves this by
interpolating between the training and the reference distribution derived from
a single test sample. To empirically analyze our self-adaptive inference
strategy, we develop and follow a rigorous evaluation protocol that addresses
serious limitations of previous work. Our extensive analysis leads to a
surprising conclusion: Using a standard training procedure, self-adaptation
significantly outperforms strong baselines and sets new state-of-the-art
accuracy on multi-domain benchmarks. Our study suggests that self-adaptive
inference may complement the established practice of model regularization at
training time for improving deep network generalization to out-of-domain data.

  Expression Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Current facial expression recognition systems demand an expensive re-training
routine when deployed to different scenarios than they were trained for.
Biasing them towards learning specific facial characteristics, instead of
performing typical transfer learning methods, might help these systems to
maintain high performance in different tasks, but with a reduced training
effort. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Inhibitory Adaptati On (CIAO), a
mechanism that adapts the last layer of facial encoders to depict specific
affective characteristics on different datasets. CIAO presents an improvement
in facial expression recognition performance over six different datasets with
very unique affective representations, in particular when compared with
state-of-the-art models. In our discussions, we make an in-depth analysis of
how the learned high-level facial features are represented, and how they
contribute to each individual dataset's characteristics. We finalize our study
by discussing how CIAO positions itself within the range of recent findings on
non-universal facial expressions perception, and its impact on facial
expression recognition research.

connected to the private value of patents across discrete and complex
innovation. The underlying theory suggests that the social value of cumulative
patents is less related to the private value of patents. We use the patents
applied between 1995 to 2002 and granted on or before December 2018 from the
Indian Patent Office (IPO). Here the patent renewal information is utilized as
a proxy for the private value of the patent. We have used a variety of logit
regression model for the impact assessment analysis. The results reveal that
the technology classification (i.e., discrete versus complex innovations) plays
an important role in patent value assessment, and some technologies are
significantly different than the others even within the two broader
classifications. Moreover, the non-resident patents in India are more likely to
have a higher value than the resident patents. According to the conclusions of
this study, only a few technologies from the discrete and complex innovation
categories have some private value. There is no evidence that patent social
value indicators are less useful in complicated technical classes than in
discrete ones.

physical networks. In a resistive electrical circuit with variable resistors,
an activation current is applied at a set of input nodes at one frequency, and
an error current is applied at a set of output nodes at another frequency. The
voltage response of the circuit to these boundary currents is the superposition
of an `activation signal' and an `error signal' whose coefficients can be read
in different frequencies of the frequency domain. Each conductance is updated
proportionally to the product of the two coefficients. The learning rule is
local and proved to perform gradient descent on a loss function. We argue that
frequency propagation is an instance of a multi-mechanism learning strategy for
physical networks, be it resistive, elastic, or flow networks. Multi-mechanism
learning strategies incorporate at least two physical quantities, potentially
governed by independent physical mechanisms, to act as activation and error
signals in the training process. Locally available information about these two
signals is then used to update the trainable parameters to perform gradient
descent. We demonstrate how earlier work implementing learning via chemical
signaling in flow networks also falls under the rubric of multi-mechanism
learning.

superhydrophobic surfaces have been developed for various applications.
Designated surface coating is one of the fabrication routes to achieve the
superhydrophobicity. Yet, many of these coatings, such as fluorine-based
formulations, may pose severe health and environmental risks, limiting the
applicability. Herein, we present a new family of superhydrophobic coatings
comprised of natural saturated fatty acids, which are not only a part of our
daily diet, but can be produced from renewable feedstock, providing a safe and
sustainable alternative to existing state-of-the-art. These crystalline
coatings are readily fabricated via single-step deposition routes, thermal
deposition or spray-coating. The fatty acids self-assemble into highly
hierarchical crystalline structures exhibiting a water contact angle of about
165 degrees and contact angle hysteresis lower than 6 degrees, while their
properties and morphology depend on the specific fatty acid used as well as on
the deposition technique. Moreover, the fatty acid coatings demonstrate
excellent thermal stability. Importantly these new family of coatings displays
excellent anti-biofouling and antimicrobial properties against Escherichia coli
and Listeria innocua, used as relevant model Gram-negative and Gram-positive
bacteria, respectively. We believe that these coatings have a great application
potential in the fields, where other alternatives are prohibited due to safety
limitations, while at the same time their usage in other regulation-free
applications is not limited.

flood monitoring, and satellite-derived flood maps provide a computationally
efficient alternative to numerical flood inundation models traditionally used.
While satellites do offer timely inundation information when they happen to
cover an ongoing flood event, they are limited by their spatiotemporal
resolution in terms of their ability to dynamically monitor flood evolution at
various scales. Constantly improving access to new satellite data sources as
well as big data processing capabilities has unlocked an unprecedented number
of possibilities in terms of data-driven solutions to this problem.
Specifically, the fusion of data from satellites, such as the Copernicus
Sentinels, which have high spatial and low temporal resolution, with data from
NASA SMAP and GPM missions, which have low spatial but high temporal
resolutions could yield high-resolution flood inundation at a daily scale. Here
a Convolutional-Neural-Network is trained using flood inundation maps derived
from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar and various hydrological,
topographical, and land-use based predictors for the first time, to predict
high-resolution probabilistic maps of flood inundation. The performance of UNet
and SegNet model architectures for this task is evaluated, using flood masks
derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, separately with 95 percent-confidence
intervals. The Area under the Curve (AUC) of the Precision Recall Curve
(PR-AUC) is used as the main evaluation metric, due to the inherently
imbalanced nature of classes in a binary flood mapping problem, with the best
model delivering a PR-AUC of 0.85.

$P = [y_0, y_1, ..., y_m]$ of positive integers which sum to $n$, where the
$y_i$ are called the $parts$ of the partition. A Young diagram is a visual
representation of a partition using rows of boxes, where each row of boxes
corresponds to a part. The conjugate partition is similar to a transpose of a
matrix; we switch the rows with columns, or the index of a part with the part
itself. Self-conjugate partitions are partitions that are equal to their
conjugate; previously, the only known way to verify whether a partition is
self-conjugate was through the use of a Young diagram. In this research, by
proving preliminary lemmas and theorems about easily identifiable shapes which
are symmetric, we come to the main result: by simply adding the multiplicities
of parts appropriately, we can show whether or not a partition is
self-conjugate without the use of a Young diagram.

of proper orthogonal descriptors (PODs). Because of the rapid convergence of
the KL expansion, relevant snapshots can be sampled exhaustively to represent
the atomic neighborhood environment accurately with a small number of
descriptors. The proper orthogonal descriptors are used to develop interatomic
potentials by using a linear expansion of the descriptors and determining the
expansion coefficients from a weighted least-squares regression against a
density functional theory (DFT) training set. We present a comprehensive
evaluation of the POD potentials on previously published DFT data sets
comprising Li, Mo, Cu, Ni, Si, Ge, and Ta elements. The data sets represent a
diverse pool of metals, transition metals, and semiconductors. The accuracy of
the POD potentials are comparable to that of state-of-the-art machine learning

traditional data sources because it is easy to collect and highly abundant. Our
work focuses on studying the potential of textual data, in particular news
pieces, for measuring economic policy uncertainty (EPU). Economic policy
uncertainty is defined as the public's inability to predict the outcomes of
their decisions under new policies and future economic fundamentals.
Quantifying EPU is of great importance to policy makers, economists, and
investors since it influences their expectations about the future economic
fundamentals with an impact on their policy, investment and saving decisions.
Most of the previous work using news articles for measuring EPU are either
manual or based on a simple keyword search. Our work proposes a machine
learning based solution involving weak supervision to classify news articles
with regards to economic policy uncertainty. Weak supervision is shown to be an
efficient machine learning paradigm for applying machine learning models in low
resource settings with no or scarce training sets, leveraging domain knowledge
and heuristics. We further generated a weak supervision based EPU index that we
used to conduct extensive econometric analysis along with the Irish
macroeconomic indicators to validate whether our generated index foreshadows
