that an integer $a$ which is not $-1$ or a square is a primitive root for
infintely many primes, and that the set of those primes has a positive
asymptotic density among all primes. This conjectured was proved, under the
generalized Riemann hypothesis (GRH), in 1967 by Hooley. More generally, an
integer is called a generalized primitive root modulo $n$ if it generates a
subgroup of $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^*$ of maximal size. Li and Pomerance
showed, under GRH, that the set of integers for which a given integer is a
generalized primitive root doesn't have an asymptotic density among all
integers. We study here the set of the $\ell$-almost primes, i.e. integers with
at most $\ell$ prime factors, for which a given integer
$a\in\mathbb{Z}\backslash\{-1\}$, which is not a square, is a generalized

for depth estimation using a single monocular image. First, it is nontrivial to
train a metric-depth prediction model that can generalize well to diverse
scenes mainly due to limited training data. Thus, researchers have built
large-scale relative depth datasets that are much easier to collect. However,
existing relative depth estimation models often fail to recover accurate 3D
scene shapes due to the unknown depth shift caused by training with the
relative depth data. We tackle this problem here and attempt to estimate
accurate scene shapes by training on large-scale relative depth data, and
estimating the depth shift. To do so, we propose a two-stage framework that
first predicts depth up to an unknown scale and shift from a single monocular
image, and then exploits 3D point cloud data to predict the depth shift and the
camera's focal length that allow us to recover 3D scene shapes. As the two
modules are trained separately, we do not need strictly paired training data.
In addition, we propose an image-level normalized regression loss and a
normal-based geometry loss to improve training with relative depth annotation.
We test our depth model on nine unseen datasets and achieve state-of-the-art
performance on zero-shot evaluation. Code is available at: https://git.io/Depth

  Slicing",,,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Program slicing reduces a program to a smaller version that retains a chosen
computation, referred to as a slicing criterion. One recent multi-lingual
slicing approach, observation-based slicing (ORBS), speculatively deletes parts
of the program and then executes the code. If the behavior of the slicing
criteria is unchanged, the speculative deletion is made permanent.
  While this makes ORBS language agnostic, it can lead to the production of
some non-intuitive slices. One particular challenge is when the execution
environment plays a role. For example, ORBS will delete the line ""a = 0"" if the
memory location assigned to a contains zero before executing the statement,
since deletion will not affect the value of a and thus the slicing criterion.
Consequently, slices can differ between execution environments due to factors
such as initialization and call stack reuse.
  The technique considered, nVORBS, attempts to ameliorate this problem by
validating a candidate slice in n different execution environments. We conduct
an empirical study to collect initial insights into how often the execution
environment leads to slice differences. Specifically, we compare and contrast
the slices produced by seven different instantiations of nVORBS. Looking
forward, the technique can be seen as a variation on metamorphic testing, and
thus suggests how ideas from metamorphic testing might be used to improve
dynamic program analysis.

critical for several tasks, including active control and optimization. One
well-known procedure to obtain the desired reduced-order model in the proximity
of a periodic solution of the governing equations is continuous-time balanced
truncation. Within this framework, the periodic reachability and observability
Gramians are usually estimated numerically via quadrature using the forward and
adjoint post-transient response to impulses. However, this procedure can be
computationally expensive, especially in the presence of slowly-decaying
transients. Moreover, it can only be performed if the periodic orbit is stable
in the sense of Floquet. In order to address these issues, we use the
frequency-domain representation of the Gramians, which we henceforth refer to
as frequential Gramians. First, these frequential Gramians are well-defined for
both stable and unstable dynamics. In particular, we show that when the
underlying system is unstable, these Gramians satisfy a pair of allied
differential Lyapunov equations. Second, they can be estimated numerically by
solving algebraic systems of equations that lend themselves to heavy
computational parallelism and that deliver the desired post-transient response
without having to follow physical transients. We demonstrate the method on a
periodically-forced axisymmetric jet at Reynolds numbers Re=1250 and Re=1500.
At the lower Reynolds number, the flow strongly amplifies subharmonic
perturbations and exhibits vortex pairing about a Floquet-stable T-periodic
solution. At the higher Reynolds number, the underlying T-periodic orbit is
unstable and the flow naturally settles onto a 2T-periodic limit cycle
characterized by pairing vortices. At both Reynolds numbers, we use a balanced
reduced-order model to design a feedback controller and a state estimator to
suppress vortex pairing.

code, developing techniques and tools for such graphs can be highly beneficial
for detecting vulnerabilities in software for its reliability. However,
existing heterogeneous graph techniques are still insufficient in handling
complex graphs where the number of different types of nodes and edges is large
and variable. This paper concentrates on the Ethereum smart contracts as a
sample of software codes represented by heterogeneous contract graphs built
upon both control-flow graphs and call graphs containing different types of
nodes and links. We propose MANDO, a new heterogeneous graph representation to
learn such heterogeneous contract graphs' structures. MANDO extracts customized
metapaths, which compose relational connections between different types of
nodes and their neighbors. Moreover, it develops a multi-metapath heterogeneous
graph attention network to learn multi-level embeddings of different types of
nodes and their metapaths in the heterogeneous contract graphs, which can
capture the code semantics of smart contracts more accurately and facilitate
both fine-grained line-level and coarse-grained contract-level vulnerability
detection. Our extensive evaluation of large smart contract datasets shows that
MANDO improves the vulnerability detection results of other techniques at the
coarse-grained contract level. More importantly, it is the first learning-based
approach capable of identifying vulnerabilities at the fine-grained line-level,
and significantly improves the traditional code analysis-based vulnerability
detection approaches by 11.35% to 70.81% in terms of F1-score.

lack of tools that help at least to understand, if not predict, economic
crises. Currently, macroeconomic modeling is dominated by Dynamic Stochastic
General Equilibrium (DSGE) models. The limitations of DSGE in coping with the
complexity of today's global economy are often recognized and are the subject
of intense research to find possible solutions. As an alternative or complement
to DSGE, the last two decades have seen the rise of agent-based models (ABM).
An attractive feature of ABM is that it can model very complex systems because
it is a bottom-up approach that can describe the specific behavior of
heterogeneous agents. The main obstacle, however, is the large number of
parameters that need to be known or calibrated. To enable the use of ABM with

popularity in multiuser networks. It's due to its advantages in sense of total
network throughput. It becomes especially significant in large networks such as
Internet of Things (IoT) networks or 5G networks. One of the known NOMA
techniques is DS-CDMA NOMA, which make use of non-orthogonal coding schemes to
optimize capacity at multiuser networks. Equiangular Tight Frames (ETF) are
known to be an optimal sequences' sets (in sense of capacity) for this
technique. Unfortunately, ETFs are limited to very specific pairs of users'
number and sequence lengths which put undesirable constraints on practical
systems. In this paper our goal is to break those constraints by proposing
alternative family of non-orthogonal sequences which on the one hand, possess
similar properties to those of ETFs (for that reason we'll denote them as
Almost ETFs) and on the other hand, doesn't have those limitation on users'
number and sequence length. We're basing our approach by starting with known
technique of building standard ETFs, and extending it by slight modifications
to technique of building AETFs. In this paper we'll concentrate on bipolar
(+/-1 valued) and relatively short (up to length of 100) sequences, since we're
interested in sequences which will be of practical value in real systems.

feed on healthy cells nearby and keep increasing in size. This may affect the
soft tissues, nerve cells, and small blood vessels in the brain. Hence there is
a need to detect and classify them during the early stages with utmost
precision. There are different sizes and locations of brain tumors which makes
it difficult to understand their nature. The process of detection and
classification of brain tumors can prove to be an onerous task even with
advanced MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) techniques due to the similarities
between the healthy cells nearby and the tumor. In this paper, we have used
Keras and Tensorflow to implement state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network

VGG16, using Transfer Learning to detect and classify three types of brain

consisted of 3264 2-D magnetic resonance images and 4 classes. Due to the small
size of the dataset, various data augmentation techniques were used to increase
the size of the dataset. Our proposed methodology not only consists of data
augmentation, but also various image denoising techniques, skull stripping,

performed the best giving an accuracy of 97.61%. The aim of this paper is to
differentiate between normal and abnormal pixels and also classify them with

its vital functions in the human body, such as detoxification of the blood from
waste products and medications. Liver diseases due to liver tumors are one of
the most common mortality reasons around the globe. Hence, detecting liver
tumors in the early stages of tumor development is highly required as a
critical part of medical treatment. Many imaging modalities can be used as
aiding tools to detect liver tumors. Computed tomography (CT) is the most used
imaging modality for soft tissue organs such as the liver. This is because it
is an invasive modality that can be captured relatively quickly. This paper
proposed an efficient automatic liver segmentation framework to detect and
segment the liver out of CT abdomen scans using the 3D CNN DeepMedic network
model. Segmenting the liver region accurately and then using the segmented
liver region as input to tumors segmentation method is adopted by many studies
as it reduces the false rates resulted from segmenting abdomen organs as
tumors. The proposed 3D CNN DeepMedic model has two pathways of input rather
than one pathway, as in the original 3D CNN model. In this paper, the network
was supplied with multiple abdomen CT versions, which helped improve the
segmentation quality. The proposed model achieved 94.36%, 94.57%, 91.86%, and
93.14% for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Dice similarity score,
respectively. The experimental results indicate the applicability of the

parameterization, a deformation field can be modeled with its transformation
Jacobian determinant and curl of end velocity field. The new model of the
deformation field has three important advantages; firstly, it relaxes the need
for an explicit regularization term and the corresponding weight in the cost
function. The smoothness is implicitly embedded in the solution which results
in a physically plausible deformation field. Secondly, it guarantees
diffeomorphism through explicit constraints applied to the transformation
Jacobian determinant to keep it positive. Finally, it is suitable for cardiac
data processing, since the nature of this parameterization is to define the
deformation field in terms of the radial and rotational components. The
effectiveness of the algorithm is investigated by evaluating the proposed
method on three different data sets including 2D and 3D cardiac MRI scans. The
results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing

limit of periodic quantum systems and applied it successfully to the problem of
the quantum bouncer. It is well known that, for periodic systems, the classical
probability density does not follow the quantum probability density. Instead,
it follows the local average in the limit of large quantum numbers. Guided by
this fact, and expressing both the classical and quantum probability densities
as Fourier expansions, here we show that local averaging implies that the
Fourier coefficients approach each other in the limit of large quantum numbers.
The leading term in the quantum Fourier coefficient yields the exact classical
limit, but subdominant terms also emerge, which we may interpret as quantum
corrections at the macroscopic level. We apply this theory to the problem of a
particle bouncing under the gravity field and show that the classical
probability density is exactly recovered from the quantum distribution. We show
that for realistic systems, the quantum corrections are strongly suppressed (by
a factor of $\sim 10^{-10}$) with respect to the classical result.

and perform analyses of variance (ANOVA) on the ratio of infections per
profile. With this, we identify which machine profile is targeted by
cybercriminals at different points in time.
  Our results show that a number of downloaders present different behaviors
depending on a number of features of a machine. Notably, a higher number of
infections for specific malware families were observed when using different
browser profiles, keyboard layouts and operating systems, while one keyboard
layout obtained fewer infections of a specific malware family.
  Our findings bring light to the importance of the features of a machine
running malicious downloader software, particularly for malware research.

data-driven fault detection and diagnostics models can be employed. In
practice, however, the performance of data-driven models can be compromised if

We propose to approach this problem by learning a feature representation that
is, on the one hand, invariant to operating or environmental factors but, on
the other hand, sensitive to changes in the asset's health condition. We
evaluate how contrastive learning can be employed on supervised and
unsupervised fault detection and diagnostics tasks given real condition
monitoring datasets within a railway system - one image dataset from
infrastructure assets and one time-series dataset from rolling stock assets.
First, we evaluate the performance of supervised contrastive feature learning
on a railway sleeper defect classification task given a labeled image dataset.
Second, we evaluate the performance of unsupervised contrastive feature
learning without access to faulty samples on an anomaly detection task given a
railway wheel dataset. Here, we test the hypothesis of whether a feature
encoder's sensitivity to degradation is also sensitive to novel fault patterns
in the data. Our results demonstrate that contrastive feature learning improves
the performance on the supervised classification task regarding sleepers
compared to a state-of-the-art method. Moreover, on the anomaly detection task
concerning the railway wheels, the detection of shelling defects is improved
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

at tackling the problem of divergence (or shift) between the labeled training
and validation datasets (source domain) and a potentially large unlabeled
dataset (target domain). The task is to embed both datasets red into a common
space in which the source dataset is informative for training while the
divergence between source and target is minimized. The most popular domain
adaptation solutions are based on training neural networks that combine
classification and adversarial learning modules, frequently making them both
data-hungry and difficult to train. We present a method called Domain
Adaptation Principal Component Analysis (DAPCA) that identifies a linear
reduced data representation useful for solving the domain adaptation task.
DAPCA algorithm introduces positive and negative weights between pairs of data
points, and generalizes the supervised extension of principal component
analysis. DAPCA is an iterative algorithm that solves a simple quadratic
optimization problem at each iteration. The convergence of the algorithm is
guaranteed, and the number of iterations is small in practice. We validate the
suggested algorithm on previously proposed benchmarks for solving the domain
adaptation task. We also show the benefit of using DAPCA in analyzing the
single-cell omics datasets in biomedical applications. Overall, DAPCA can serve
as a practical preprocessing step in many machine learning applications leading
to reduced dataset representations, taking into account possible divergence
between source and target domains.

small number of available data remains the main challenge. TC can be

compared to the more resource-demanding first-principles calculations. Here, we
demonstrate the use of transfer learning (TL) to improve the machine learning
models trained on small but high-fidelity TC data from experiments and
first-principles calculations, by leveraging a large but low-fidelity data
generated from empirical TC models, where the trainings on high- and
low-fidelity TC data are treated as different but related tasks. TL improves
the model accuracy by as much as 23% in R2 and reduces the average factor
difference by as much as 30%. Using the TL model, a large semiconductor
database is screened, and several candidates with room temperature TC > 350
W/mK are identified and further verified using first-principles simulations.
This study demonstrates that TL can leverage big low-fidelity data as a proxy

affects the rewards obtained during that episode but does not affect the
dynamics. Various techniques have been proposed to improve performance in
goal-conditioned environments, such as automatic curriculum generation and goal
relabeling. In this work, we explore a connection between off-policy
reinforcement learning in goal-conditioned settings and knowledge distillation.
In particular: the current Q-value function and the target Q-value estimate are
both functions of the goal, and we would like to train the Q-value function to
match its target for all goals. We therefore apply Gradient-Based Attention
Transfer (Zagoruyko and Komodakis 2017), a knowledge distillation technique, to
the Q-function update. We empirically show that this can improve the
performance of goal-conditioned off-policy reinforcement learning when the
space of goals is high-dimensional. We also show that this technique can be
adapted to allow for efficient learning in the case of multiple simultaneous
sparse goals, where the agent can attain a reward by achieving any one of a
large set of objectives, all specified at test time. Finally, to provide
theoretical support, we give examples of classes of environments where (under
some assumptions) standard off-policy algorithms such as DDPG require at least
O(d^2) replay buffer transitions to learn an optimal policy, while our proposed
technique requires only O(d) transitions, where d is the dimensionality of the
goal and state space. Code is available at

large amount, many series are canceled due to a lack of originality that
generates a low audience.
  Problem: Having a decision support system that can show why some shows are a
huge success or not would facilitate the choices of renewing or starting a
show.
  Solution: We studied the case of the series Arrow broadcasted by CW Network
and used descriptive and predictive modeling techniques to predict the IMDb
rating. We assumed that the theme of the episode would affect its evaluation by
users, so the dataset is composed only by the director of the episode, the
number of reviews that episode got, the percentual of each theme extracted by
the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model of an episode, the number of
viewers from Wikipedia and the rating from IMDb. The LDA model is a generative
probabilistic model of a collection of documents made up of words.
  Method: In this prescriptive research, the case study method was used, and
its results were analyzed using a quantitative approach.
  Summary of Results: With the features of each episode, the model that
performed the best to predict the rating was Catboost due to a similar mean
squared error of the KNN model but a better standard deviation during the test
phase. It was possible to predict IMDb ratings with an acceptable root mean
squared error of 0.55.

  with Applications to Inverse Problems","22 pages, 1 figure",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The remarkable successes of neural networks in a huge variety of inverse
problems have fueled their adoption in disciplines ranging from medical imaging
to seismic analysis over the past decade. However, the high dimensionality of
such inverse problems has simultaneously left current theory, which predicts
that networks should scale exponentially in the dimension of the problem,
unable to explain why the seemingly small networks used in these settings work
as well as they do in practice. To reduce this gap between theory and practice,
we provide a general method for bounding the complexity required for a neural
network to approximate a H\""older (or uniformly) continuous function defined on
a high-dimensional set with a low-complexity structure. The approach is based
on the observation that the existence of a Johnson-Lindenstrauss embedding
$A\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times D}$ of a given high-dimensional set
$S\subset\mathbb{R}^D$ into a low dimensional cube $[-M,M]^d$ implies that for
any H\""older (or uniformly) continuous function $f:S\to\mathbb{R}^p$, there
exists a H\""older (or uniformly) continuous function
$g:[-M,M]^d\to\mathbb{R}^p$ such that $g(Ax)=f(x)$ for all $x\in S$. Hence, if
one has a neural network which approximates $g:[-M,M]^d\to\mathbb{R}^p$, then a
layer can be added that implements the JL embedding $A$ to obtain a neural
network that approximates $f:S\to\mathbb{R}^p$. By pairing JL embedding results
along with results on approximation of H\""older (or uniformly) continuous
functions by neural networks, one then obtains results which bound the
complexity required for a neural network to approximate H\""older (or uniformly)
continuous functions on high dimensional sets. The end result is a general
theoretical framework which can then be used to better explain the observed
empirical successes of smaller networks in a wider variety of inverse problems
than current theory allows.

turn-taking, in addition to disfluencies. These disfluencies include pausing to

this paper, we present a turntaking predictor built on top of the end-to-end

evaluation with observational data. The RD design enables the identification of
the local average treatment effect (LATE) at the treatment cutoff by exploiting
known deterministic treatment assignment mechanisms. The primary focus of the
existing literature has been the development of rigorous estimation methods for
the LATE. In contrast, we consider policy learning under the RD design. We
develop a robust optimization approach to finding an optimal treatment cutoff
that improves upon the existing one. Under the RD design, policy learning
requires extrapolation. We address this problem by partially identifying the
conditional expectation function of counterfactual outcome under a smoothness
assumption commonly used for the estimation of LATE. We then minimize the worst
case regret relative to the status quo policy. The resulting new treatment
cutoffs have a safety guarantee, enabling policy makers to limit the
probability that they yield a worse outcome than the existing cutoff. Going
beyond the standard single-cutoff case, we generalize the proposed methodology
to the multi-cutoff RD design by developing a doubly robust estimator. We
establish the asymptotic regret bounds for the learned policy using
semi-parametric efficiency theory. Finally, we apply the proposed methodology

Taiwan's Diversion protocol involves diverting those in self-quarantine due to
exposure, thus preventing them from mingling with the general public at a
congregate shelter. The Diversion protocol, combined with sufficient vaccine
uptake, can decrease the maximum number of infections and delay outbreaks
relative to scenarios without such strategies. When the diversion of all

Diversion protocol is still valuable. Furthermore, a group of evacuees that

when the Diversion protocol is not enforced, the majority elderly group suffers
from up to 20% more severe cases than the majority young adult group.

into the white matter development. However, slice thickness in fetal dMRI is
typically high (i.e., 3-5 mm) to freeze the in-plane motion, which reduces the
sensitivity of the dMRI signal to the underlying anatomy. In this study, we aim
at overcoming this problem by using autoencoders to learn unsupervised
efficient representations of brain slices in a latent space, using raw dMRI
signals and their spherical harmonics (SH) representation. We first learn and
quantitatively validate the autoencoders on the developing Human Connectome
Project pre-term newborn data, and further test the method on fetal data. Our
results show that the autoencoder in the signal domain better synthesized the
raw signal. Interestingly, the fractional anisotropy and, to a lesser extent,
the mean diffusivity, are best recovered in missing slices by using the
autoencoder trained with SH coefficients. A comparison was performed with the
same maps reconstructed using an autoencoder trained with raw signals, as well
as conventional interpolation methods of raw signals and SH coefficients. From
these results, we conclude that the recovery of missing/corrupted slices should
be performed in the signal domain if the raw signal is aimed to be recovered,
and in the SH domain if diffusion tensor properties (i.e., fractional
anisotropy) are targeted. Notably, the trained autoencoders were able to
generalize to fetal dMRI data acquired using a much smaller number of diffusion
gradients and a lower b-value, where we qualitatively show the consistency of
the estimated diffusion tensor maps.

  To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a Time-aware

mechanism into reasoning-based recommendation. Specially, temporal patterns
represented by relative time, provide context and auxiliary information to

leveraged to distill informative patterns and suppress irrelevances. Therefore,
the fusion of self-attentive temporal information provides deeper

cooperative path planning algorithm for multiple UAVs based on the stag hunt
game and particle swarm optimization (PSO). First, a cost function for each UAV

proposed to obtain optimal paths for the UAVs. Simulation results for a large

proposed algorithm in generating feasible and efficient flight paths for UAV

extensive interest and several intriguing phenomena have been reported in
recent experiments, such as the emergence of zero-bias conductance peaks upon
the adsorption of single-helical protein on superconducting films. Here, we
study theoretically the electron transport through a two-terminal
single-helical protein sandwiched between a superconducting electrode and a
normal-metal one in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. As the
proximity-induced superconductivity attenuates with the distance from
superconducting media, the pairing potential along the helix axis of the
single-helical protein is expected to decrease exponentially, which is
characterized by the decay exponent $\lambda$ and closely related to the
experiments. Our results indicate that (i) a zero-bias conductance peak of
$2e^2/h$ appears at zero temperature and the peak height (width) decreases
(broadens) with increasing temperature, and (ii) this zero-bias peak can split
into two peaks, which are in agreement with the experiments [see, e.g., Nano
Lett. 19, 5167 (2019)]. Remarkably, Majorana zero modes are observed in this
protein-superconductor setup in a wide range of model parameters, as manifested
by the $Z_2$ topological invariant and the Majoroana oscillation.
Interestingly, a specific region is demonstrated for decaying
superconductivity, where topologically nontrivial and trivial zero modes
coexist and the bandgap remains constant. With increasing the pairing
potential, the topologically nontrivial zero modes will transform to the
trivial ones without any bandgap closing-reopening, and the critical pairing
potential of the phase transition attenuates exponentially with $\lambda$.
Additionally, one of the two zero modes can be continuously shifted from one
end of the protein toward the other end contacted by the normal-metal
electrode.

user can bring to a business. It is widely used in a variety of business
scenarios to make operational decisions when acquiring new customers. Modeling
LTV is a challenging problem, due to its complex and mutable data distribution.
Existing approaches either directly learn from posterior feature distributions
or leverage statistical models that make strong assumption on prior
distributions, both of which fail to capture those mutable distributions. In
this paper, we propose a complete set of industrial-level LTV modeling
solutions. Specifically, we introduce an Order Dependency Monotonic Network
(ODMN) that models the ordered dependencies between LTVs of different time
spans, which greatly improves model performance. We further introduce a Multi
Distribution Multi Experts (MDME) module based on the Divide-and-Conquer idea,
which transforms the severely imbalanced distribution modeling problem into a
series of relatively balanced sub-distribution modeling problems hence greatly
reduces the modeling complexity. In addition, a novel evaluation metric Mutual
Gini is introduced to better measure the distribution difference between the
estimated value and the ground-truth label based on the Lorenz Curve. The ODMN
framework has been successfully deployed in many business scenarios of
Kuaishou, and achieved great performance. Extensive experiments on real-world
industrial data demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods compared to
state-of-the-art baselines including ZILN and Two-Stage XGBoost models.

numerically solve equations from the Bondi radius to near the black hole. The
focus of our discussion will be on the properties of slightly rotating
accretion flows in which radiative losses have been ignored. This study
discusses how outer boundary conditions (the temperature and specific angular
momentum at the outer boundary) influence accretion flow dynamics. We
investigate two physically discontinuous regimes: The Bondi-like type accretion
and the Disk-like type accretion. A Bondi-like accretion occurs when the
specific angular momentum at the Bondi radius $ \ell_{B} $ is smaller than the
specific angular momentum at the marginally stable orbit $ \ell_{ms} $. In
comparison, a Disk-like accretion occurs when the specific angular momentum at
the Bondi radius $ \ell_{B} $ is larger than the specific angular momentum of
the marginally stable orbit $ \ell_{ms} $. We also keep the assumption of
hydrostatic equilibrium and compare our results with the case in which it is

intra-city flows are generally along a negative population density gradient,

flows are anisotropic and generally directed towards external counties of
cities, driving asymmetrical urban sprawl. Such domestic migration dynamics are
also responsible for tempering local population shocks by redistributing

accuracy than local and semilocal approximations to the exchange-correlation
functional, but this comes with drastically increased computational cost.
Practical implementations of HDFs inevitably involve numerical approximations
-- even more so than their local and semilocal counterparts due to the
additional numerical complexity arising from treating the exact-exchange
component. This raises the question regarding the reproducibility of the HDF
results yielded by different implementations. In this work, we benchmark the
numerical precision of four independent implementations of the popular
Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) range-separated HDF on describing key materials'
properties, including both properties derived from equations of states (EOS)
and band gaps of 20 crystalline solids. We find that the energy band gaps
obtained by the four codes agree with each other rather satisfactorily.
However, for lattice constants and bulk moduli, the deviations between the
results computed by different codes are of the same order of magnitude as the
deviations between the computational and experimental results. On the one hand,
this means that the HSE functional is rather accurate for describing the
cohesive properties of simple insulating solids. On the other hand, this also
suggests that the numerical precision achieved with current major HSE
implementation is not sufficiently high to unambiguously assess the physical

  Similarity","COLING2022",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Semantically meaningful sentence embeddings are important for numerous tasks
in natural language processing. To obtain such embeddings, recent studies
explored the idea of utilizing synthetically generated data from pretrained
language models (PLMs) as a training corpus. However, PLMs often generate
sentences much different from the ones written by human. We hypothesize that
treating all these synthetic examples equally for training deep neural networks
can have an adverse effect on learning semantically meaningful embeddings. To
analyze this, we first train a classifier that identifies machine-written
sentences, and observe that the linguistic features of the sentences identified
as written by a machine are significantly different from those of human-written
sentences. Based on this, we propose a novel approach that first trains the
classifier to measure the importance of each sentence. The distilled
information from the classifier is then used to train a reliable sentence
embedding model. Through extensive evaluation on four real-world datasets, we
demonstrate that our model trained on synthetic data generalizes well and
outperforms the existing baselines. Our implementation is publicly available at

operations (or gates) between two quantum bits (or qubits). A physical machine
typically provides a set of basis gates that include primitive 2-qubit (2Q) and
1-qubit (1Q) gates that can be implemented in a given technology. 2Q entangling
gates, coupled with some 1Q gates, allow for universal quantum computation. In
superconducting technologies, the current state of the art is to implement the
same 2Q gate between every pair of qubits (typically an XX- or XY-type gate).
This strict hardware uniformity requirement for 2Q gates in a large quantum
computer has made scaling up a time and resource-intensive endeavor in the lab.
We propose a radical idea -- allow the 2Q basis gate(s) to differ between every
pair of qubits, selecting the best entangling gates that can be calibrated
between given pairs of qubits. This work aims to give quantum scientists the
ability to run meaningful algorithms with qubit systems that are not perfectly
uniform. Scientists will also be able to use a much broader variety of novel 2Q
gates for quantum computing. We develop a theoretical framework for identifying
good 2Q basis gates on ""nonstandard"" Cartan trajectories that deviate from
""standard"" trajectories like XX. We then introduce practical methods for
calibration and compilation with nonstandard 2Q gates, and discuss possible
ways to improve the compilation. To demonstrate our methods in a case study, we
simulated both standard XY-type trajectories and faster, nonstandard
trajectories using an entangling gate architecture with far-detuned transmon
qubits. We identify efficient 2Q basis gates on these nonstandard trajectories
and use them to compile a number of standard benchmark circuits such as QFT and
QAOA. Our results demonstrate an 8x improvement over the baseline 2Q gates with

important area of causal inference. Recent approaches for multiple mediators
are often based on parametric models and thus may suffer from model
misspecification. Also, much of the existing literature either only allow
estimation of the joint mediation effect, or, estimate the joint mediation
effect as the sum of individual mediator effects, which often is not a
reasonable assumption. In this paper, we propose a methodology which overcomes
the two aforementioned drawbacks. Our method is based on a novel Bayesian
nonparametric (BNP) approach, wherein the joint distribution of the observed
data (outcome, mediators, treatment, and confounders) is modeled flexibly using
an enriched Dirichlet process mixture with three levels: the first level
characterizing the conditional distribution of the outcome given the mediators,
treatment and the confounders, the second level corresponding to the
conditional distribution of each of the mediators given the treatment and the
confounders, and the third level corresponding to the distribution of the
treatment and the confounders. We use standardization (g-computation) to
compute causal mediation effects under three uncheckable assumptions that allow
identification of the individual and joint mediation effects. The efficacy of
our proposed method is demonstrated with simulations. We apply our proposed
method to analyze data from a study of Ventilator-associated Pneumonia (VAP)
co-infected patients, where the effect of the abundance of Pseudomonas on VAP

and conclude that the central gas depletion time does not depend on galactic
mass. In turn, the ratio of the gas outflow rate to the gas consumption rate by
the star formation is low in massive galaxies and high in low-mass objects,
while the star formation is a more rapid process of the gas consumption. We
compare properties of the FSFB galaxies with a control sample of 375 comparison
galaxies and find that the FSFB objects have high central concentration of star
formation, and also younger central stellar population with respect to their
periphery. We analysed the environment of the galaxies and identified nearby
satellites and elements of low surface brightness structure. We see that many

react differently for certain demographic groups compared to reference groups.
The outcome of these analyses interestingly aligns well with the results of

perceive in an environment from different flight heights. Unlike autonomous

semi-supervised learning methods are not effective under viewpoint differences.
In this paper, we introduce the ground-to-aerial perception knowledge transfer
and propose a progressive semi-supervised learning framework that enables drone
perception using only labeled data of ground viewpoint and unlabeled data of
flying viewpoints. Our framework has four core components: i) a dense viewpoint
sampling strategy that splits the range of vertical flight height into a set of
small pieces with evenly-distributed intervals, ii) nearest neighbor
pseudo-labeling that infers labels of the nearest neighbor viewpoint with a
model learned on the preceding viewpoint, iii) MixView that generates augmented
images among different viewpoints to alleviate viewpoint differences, and iv) a
progressive distillation strategy to gradually learn until reaching the maximum
flying height. We collect a synthesized and a real-world dataset, and we
perform extensive experimental analyses to show that our method yields 22.2%

  Datasets","This paper is currently under review in a journal",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to outperform traditional machine
learning algorithms in a broad variety of application domains due to their
effectiveness in modeling complex problems and handling high-dimensional
datasets. Many real-life datasets, however, are of increasingly high
dimensionality, where a large number of features may be irrelevant for both
supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. The inclusion of such features
would not only introduce unwanted noise but also increase computational
complexity. Furthermore, due to high non-linearity and dependency among a large
number of features, DNN models tend to be unavoidably opaque and perceived as
black-box methods because of their not well-understood internal functioning.
Their algorithmic complexity is often simply beyond the capacities of humans to
understand the interplay among myriads of hyperparameters. A well-interpretable
model can identify statistically significant features and explain the way they
affect the model's outcome. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to
improve the interpretability of black-box models for classification tasks in
the case of high-dimensional datasets. First, we train a black-box model on a
high-dimensional dataset to learn the embeddings on which the classification is
performed. To decompose the inner working principles of the black-box model and
to identify top-k important features, we employ different probing and
perturbing techniques. We then approximate the behavior of the black-box model
by means of an interpretable surrogate model on the top-k feature space.
Finally, we derive decision rules and local explanations from the surrogate
model to explain individual decisions. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods like TabNet and XGboost when tested on different
datasets with varying dimensionality between 50 and 20,000 w.r.t metrics and
explainability.

combined with the sub-mm dust emission over 80 per cent of the sky at a

distinguished from the optical absorption line measurements toward bright stars
which cover a tiny fraction of the gas. On the assumption that the dust-to-gas
ratio is proportional to the metallicity, we derived the metallicity of all the
HI components, i.e., the intermediate velocity clouds (IVCs), the high velocity
clouds (HVCs), as well as the local HI gas. Major results include that the
metallicity of the IVCs is in a range of 0.1 -- 1.5 (relative to the majority
of local diffuse HI gas) with a mode at 0.6, and that a significant fraction,
$\sim$30 per cent, of the IVCs includes the low metallicity gas of <0.3. In
addition, it is revealed that 80 per cent of the HVC Complex C has a
metallicity of <0.3, and that the Magellanic Stream has a uniform very low
metallicity of <0.1. We argue that a large fraction of the low metallicity IVC
gas may favor a picture of the external low-metallicity HI gas accretion
instead of the Galactic-fountain model. In addition, we find that the IVCs show
a trend that metallicity of the IVCs increases with velocity decrease,
suggesting that the IVCs are accumulating high metallicity halo gas via
dynamical interaction at z<1 kpc.

traffic throughput and reduce energy consumption. However, the uncertain
lane-change behaviors (LCBs) of surrounding vehicles (SVs) as an uncontrollable
factor significantly threaten the driving safety and the consistent movement of
a group of platoon CAVs. How to ensure safe, efficient, and fuel economic
platoon control poses a key challenge faced by researchers in complex traffic
environments. This study proposes a dynamic platoon management and cooperative
driving framework for a mixed traffic flow consisting of multiple CAVs and
possible human-driven vehicles (HDVs) as the SVs on unsignalized roads. In the
proposed framework, the leader CAV of the platoon provides a high-level
automatic driving decision to the follower CAVs by developing an optimal
trajectory estimation of the HDVs while distributed observers and tracking
controllers are properly implemented by the follower CAVs. Specifically, the
proposed framework consists of three stages. At the observation stage, the
cruising information of all the SVs will be collected by the leader CAV through
the Cellular-Vehicle-to-X (C-V2X) infrastructure, while an automatic
decision-making driving assistance system (ADMDSS) is constructed to determine
the driving states of the platoon. When the HDVs approach the communication
range of the platoon, in the prediction stage, the trajectories of the HDVs as
the target vehicles will be estimated and the reference trajectory planning for
the leader CAV and the cooperative controller design for the follower CAVs will
be respectively activated by using C-V2X infrastructure. Simulation cases are
presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

formulations studied are two regularized versions of the original variational
inequality: the penalty formulation and the augmented Lagrangian formulation.

representation of shapes. The algorithm also benefits from a mesh-cutting
technique, which gives an explicit representation of the shape at each

and the background points in outdoor LiDAR point clouds. It hinders
cutting-edge detectors from focusing on informative areas to produce accurate
3D object detection results. This paper proposes a novel object detection
network by semantical point-voxel feature interaction, dubbed PV-RCNN++. Unlike
most of existing methods, PV-RCNN++ explores the semantic information to
enhance the quality of object detection. First, a semantic segmentation module
is proposed to retain more discriminative foreground keypoints. Such a module
will guide our PV-RCNN++ to integrate more object-related point-wise and
voxel-wise features in the pivotal areas. Then, to make points and voxels
interact efficiently, we utilize voxel query based on Manhattan distance to
quickly sample voxel-wise features around keypoints. Such the voxel query will
reduce the time complexity from O(N) to O(K), compared to the ball query.
Further, to avoid being stuck in learning only local features, an
attention-based residual PointNet module is designed to expand the receptive
field to adaptively aggregate the neighboring voxel-wise features into
keypoints. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset show that PV-RCNN++
achieves 81.60$\%$, 40.18$\%$, 68.21$\%$ 3D mAP on Car, Pedestrian, and
Cyclist, achieving comparable or even better performance to the

can cause apps to crash at runtime on specific Android devices, resulting in
poor user experiences for both apps and the Android ecosystem. To mitigate this
impact, various approaches have been proposed to automatically detect such
compatibility issues. Unfortunately, these approaches have only focused on
detecting signature-induced compatibility issues (i.e., a certain API does not
exist in certain Android versions), leaving other equally important types of
compatibility issues unresolved. In this work, we propose a novel prototype
tool, JUnitTestGen, to fill this gap by mining existing Android API usage to
generate unit test cases. After locating Android API usage in given real-world
Android apps, JUnitTestGen performs inter-procedural backward data-flow
analysis to generate a minimal executable code snippet (i.e., test case).
Experimental results on thousands of real-world Android apps show that
JUnitTestGen is effective in generating valid unit test cases for Android APIs.
We show that these generated test cases are indeed helpful for pinpointing
compatibility issues, including ones involving semantic code changes.

complicated author linguistic preferences such as discourse structures than

author-style transfer, which requires transferring an input story into a
specified author style while maintaining source semantics. To tackle this
problem, we propose a generation model, named StoryTrans, which leverages
discourse representations to capture source content information and transfer
them to target styles with learnable style embeddings. We use an additional
training objective to disentangle stylistic features from the learned discourse
representation to prevent the model from degenerating to an auto-encoder.
Moreover, to enhance content preservation, we design a mask-and-fill framework
to explicitly fuse style-specific keywords of source texts into generation.
Furthermore, we constructed new datasets for this task in Chinese and English,
respectively. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms strong

concerns. To address these issues, in this paper, we investigate cooperative

assume that the external inputs of the leader CAV contain unknown but bounded

to a few neighboring follower CAVs in a free-design but directed communication
network. To solve these problems, a distributed observer law is developed to
provide a reference signal expressed as an estimated unknown jerk dynamic of
the leader CAV and implemented by each follower CAV. Then, a novel distributed
platooning tracking control protocol is proposed to construct the cooperative
tracking controllers under identical inter-vehicle constraints, which can
ensure a desired safety distance among the CAVs and allow each follower CAV to
track their leader CAV by using only local information interaction. We also
present a novel intermittent sampling condition and a robust intermittent
optimization design that can ensure optimally scheduled feedback gains for the
cooperative platooning tracking controllers to minimize the control cost under
nonidentical inter-vehicle constraints and unknown jerk dynamics. Simulation

CDSR contains three newly-established modules: (1) a Lightweight Patch-based

be able to distinguish, or discriminate, which model best represents a
phenomenon, one is interested, e.g., in so-called T-optimal designs. These
consist of the (design) points from a generally continuous design space at
which the models deviate most from each other, under the condition that they
are best fitted to those points. Thus, the T-criterion represents a bi-level
optimization problem, which can be transferred into a semi-infinite one, but
whose solution is very unstable or time consuming for non-linear models and
non-convex lower- and upper-level problems.
  If one considers only a finite number of possible design points, a
numerically well tractable linear semi-infinite optimization problem arises.
Since this is only an approximation of the original model discrimination
problem, we propose an algorithm which alternately and adaptively refines
discretizations of the parameter as well as of the design space and, thus,
solves a sequence of LSIPs. We prove convergence of our method and its
subroutine and show on the basis of discrimination tasks from process
engineering that our approach is stable and can outperform the known methods.

Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), remains the most international collaborative effort
and synergy between theorists and experimentalists in modern nuclear physics to
date. The experimentalists around the world not only collect an unprecedented
amount of data in heavy-ion collisions, at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC), at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in New York, USA, and the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC), at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland but also analyze these
data to unravel the mystery of this new phase of matter that filled a few
microseconds old universe, just after the Big Bang. In the meantime,
advancements in theoretical works and computing capability extend our wisdom
about the hot-dense QCD matter and its dynamics through mathematical equations.
The exchange of ideas between experimentalists and theoreticians is crucial for
the progress of our knowledge. The motivation of this first conference named
""HOT QCD Matter 2022"" is to bring the community together to have a discourse on
this topic. In this article, there are 36 sections discussing various topics in
the field of relativistic heavy-ion collisions and related phenomena that cover
a snapshot of the current experimental observations and theoretical progress.
This article begins with the theoretical overview of relativistic
spin-hydrodynamics in the presence of the external magnetic field, followed by
the Lattice QCD results on heavy quarks in QGP, and finally, it ends with an
overview of experiment results.

paradigm has been widely employed to jointly predict diverse user feedbacks
(e.g. click and purchase). While, existing MTL approaches are either rigid to
adapt to different scenarios, or only capture coarse-grained task relatedness,
thus making it difficult to effectively transfer knowledge across tasks.
  To address these issues, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Fine-grained
Task Relatedness modeling approach, AdaFTR, for joint CTR-CVR estimation. Our
approach is developed based on a parameter-sharing MTL architecture, and
introduces a novel adaptive inter-task representation alignment method based on
contrastive learning.Given an instance, the inter-task representations of the
same instance are considered as positive, while the representations of another
random instance are considered as negative. Furthermore, we explicitly model
fine-grained task relatedness as the contrast strength (i.e. the temperature
coefficient in InfoNCE loss) at the instance level. For this purpose, we build
a relatedness prediction network, so that it can predict the contrast strength
for inter-task representations of an instance. In this way, we can adaptively
set the temperature for contrastive learning in a fine-grained way (i.e.
instance level), so as to better capture task relatedness. Both offline
evaluation with public e-commerce datasets and online test in a real
advertising system at Alibaba have demonstrated the effectiveness of our
approach.

has forced many such endeavours to move to an online setting. While the
gender-dependent differences in programming courses have been studied
previously, for example revealing that girls may feel safer in same-sex groups,
much less is known about gender-specific differences in online programming
courses. In order to investigate whether gender-specific differences can be
observed in online courses, we conducted an online introductory programming
course for Scratch, in which we observed the gender-specific characteristics of
participants with respect to how they interact, their enjoyment, the code they
produce, and the creativity exposed by their programs. Overall, we observed no
significant differences between how girls participated in all-female vs. mixed
groups, and girls generally engaged with the course more actively than boys.
This suggests that online courses can be a useful means to avoid
gender-dependent group dynamics. However, when encouraging creative freedom in
programming, girls and boys seem to fall back to socially inherited
stereotypical behavior also in an online setting, influencing the choice of
programming concepts applied. This may inhibit learning and is a challenge that
needs to be addressed independently of whether courses are held online.

numerous effects which occur when electromagnetic waves propagate through such
media. In general, the inhomogeneity of a certain medium means that the
refraction index of the medium is not constant and has some sort of spatial
dependency. These types of media are called gradient index (GRIN) media.
Different optical effects related to GRIN media are described by GRIN optics.
GRIN optics examines different phenomena related to the gradient of the
refractive index of the medium and/or the material. Electromagnetic waves
propagating in such materials result in many effects that are being exploited
to produce lenses, optical fibers, and other devices. By symmetric
inhomogeneity, we refer to the case when the inhomogeneity of the medium or
material is not an arbitrary function of position but has some sort of
symmetry. In this dissertation, our primary focus is on two types of
inhomogeneous media. Firstly, we examine photonic crystals which are optical
structures where the refractive index changes periodically. The other type of
inhomogeneity, that is examined, is the case when the refractive index of a
medium is a continuous function of position. Moreover, the central focus is
given to profiles possessing different symmetries. Specifically, we investigate
the effects occurring in Maxwell Fish eye profile which has spherical symmetry
as well as an extended symmetry which will be thoroughly studied in Chapters 3
and 4.

is by identifying and pointing out patterns in the code that are indicative of
good or bad solutions. While such patterns have been defined for regular
block-based programs, robot-specific programming aspects have not been
considered so far. The aim of this paper is therefore to identify patterns
specific to robot programming for the Scratch-based mBlock programming
language, which is used for the popular mBot and Codey Rocky robots. We
identify: (1) 26 bug patterns, which indicate erroneous code; (2) three code
smells, which indicate code that may work but is written in a confusing or

of code that are likely good. We extend the LitterBox analysis framework to
automatically identify these patterns in mBlock programs. Evaluated on a

property of interest, e.g., stabilizability and structural properties. In sharp
contrast to the model-based analysis, we approach it by directly using the
input and state feedback data of the unknown system. Via a new concept of
sufficient richness of input sectional data, we first establish the necessary
and sufficient condition for the minimum input design to excite the system for
property ID. Specifically, the input sectional data is sufficiently rich for
property ID {\em if and only if} it spans a linear subspace that contains a
property dependent minimum linear subspace, any basis of which can also be
easily used to form the minimum excitation input. Interestingly, we show that
many structural properties can be identified with the minimum input that is

rigorously quantify the advantages of the direct data-driven analysis over the

a rich natural laboratory for astronomical X-rays with each region showcasing
its own X-ray production processes: scattering and fluorescence of solar corona
emissions; charge exchange emissions from energetic ions; Inverse-Compton,
thermal and non-thermal bremsstrahlung emissions from relativistic electrons;
and fingerprint fluorescence lines indicative of elemental composition and the
potential for life on the Galilean satellites. For the high energy astrophysics
domain, perhaps Jupiter's greatest attribute is the opportunity to connect
observed X-ray emissions with in-situ plasma and magnetic field measurements of
the precise physical processes that lead to them - irreplaceable ground truths
for systems that cannot be visited in-situ. Such simultaneous studies have
revealed that Jupiter's spectacular soft X-ray flares and pulsations are
produced by wave-particle interactions, while the bremsstrahlung aurorae vary
with magnetodisk reconnection and dipolarisation. While many remote signatures
remain to be linked with their source processes, the future is bright, with
synergistic Chandra, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton and Juno in-situ measurements
continuing to provide revolutionary insights in the coming years, while JUICE

However, to truly characterise some emissions (e.g. mapping Galilean satellite

usually with some form of programming activity. In particular, educational
robots provide an opportunity for engaging students with programming through
hands-on experiences. However, primary school teachers might not be adequately
prepared for teaching computer science related topics, and giving feedback to
students can often be challenging: Besides the content of the feedback (e.g.,
what problems have to be handled), the way the feedback is given is also
important, as it can lead to negative emotional effects. To support teachers
with the way of giving feedback on common problems when teaching programming
with robotics, we conducted a study consisting of seven workshops with three
third and four fourth grade primary school classes. Within seven different
activities, the 116 primary school children first programmed the Ozobot Evo
robot in the pen-and-paper mode and then on a digital device. Throughout these
activities we collected data on the problems the students encountered, the
feedback given, and the fun they experienced. Our analysis reveals eight
categories of problems, which we summarise in this paper together with
corresponding possible feedback. We observed that problems that are urgent or
can harm the students' self-efficacy have a negative impact on how enjoyable an
activity is perceived. While direct instruction significantly decreased the
experienced fun, hints had a positive effect. Generally, we found programming
the Ozobot Evo to be encouraging for both girls and boys. To support teachers,
we discuss ideas for giving encouraging feedback on common problems of Ozobot
Evo programming activities and how our findings transfer to other robots.

find the origin of the reflectance resonances, we model the reflectance spectra

Gaussian efficiency of the MAD is only 37% which is not always enough. In this
paper, we introduce the quantile absolute deviation (QAD) as a generalization
of the MAD. This measure of dispersion provides a flexible approach to
analyzing properties of non-parametric distributions. It also allows
controlling the trade-off between robustness and statistical efficiency. We use
the trimmed Harrell-Davis median estimator based on the highest density
interval of the given width as a complimentary median estimator that gives
increased finite-sample Gaussian efficiency compared to the sample median and a
breakdown point matched to the QAD. As a rule of thumb, we suggest using two
new measures of dispersion called the standard QAD and the optimal QAD. They
give 54% and 65% of Gaussian efficiency having breakdown points of 32% and 14%

In fact, we observe that the deviations from a perfect homologous expansion are
about 30% at roughly 100ms after the merger. To determine how these deviations

which gives rise to different optimal strategies to extract MEV. The strategic

to date, no sufficiently formal and abstract definition of MEV games have been

from different sources cannot be shared due to data privacy or transmission
limitation. To resolve this problem, federated learning has been introduced to
transfer knowledge across multiple sources (clients) with non-shared data while
optimising a globally generalised central model (server). Existing federated
learning paradigms mostly focus on transferring holistic high-level knowledge
(such as class) across models, which are closely related to specific objects of
interest so may suffer from inverse attack. In contrast, in this work, we
consider transferring mid-level semantic knowledge (such as attribute) which is
not sensitive to specific objects of interest and therefore is more
privacy-preserving and scalable. To this end, we formulate a new Federated
Zero-Shot Learning (FZSL) paradigm to learn mid-level semantic knowledge at
multiple local clients with non-shared local data and cumulatively aggregate a
globally generalised central model for deployment. To improve model
discriminative ability, we propose to explore semantic knowledge augmentation
from external knowledge for enriching the mid-level semantic space in FZSL.
Extensive experiments on five zeroshot learning benchmark datasets validate the
effectiveness of our approach for optimising a generalisable federated learning

challenges in both domains. Nonetheless, some key challenges include
scalability and deployment within real-world networks. This paper presents an
approach to integrating IOTA and ROS 2 for more scalable DLT-based robotic

is, to the best of our knowledge, the first implementation of IOTA smart

is in comparison to the vast majority of the literature which relies on
Ethereum. We present a general IOTA+ROS 2 architecture leading to
partition-tolerant decision-making processes that also inherit byzantine
tolerance properties from the embedded blockchain structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework for a cooperative mapping
application in a system with intermittent network connectivity. We show both
superior performance with respect to Ethereum in the presence of network
partitions, and a low impact in terms of computational resource utilization.
These results open the path for wider integration of blockchain solutions in

of free-flying telescope spacecrafts moving around a central combiner in order
to modulating the planet signal, within accuracy better than one micrometer at
least. Moreover, the whole array must be reconfigured regularly in order to
observe different celestial targets, thus increasing the risk of loosing one or
more spacecrafts and aborting the mission before its normal end. In this paper
is described a simplified optical configuration where the telescopes do not
need to be rotated, and the number of necessary array reconfigurations is
minimized. It allows efficient modulation of the planet signal, only making use
of rotating prisms or mirrors located into the central combiner. In this paper
the general principle of a nulling interferometer with a fixed telescope array

pressure model is first constructed. Applying the atmospheric pressure model
and realistic bathymetric data in the LSWE model, tsunami generation and
propagation are simulated in the Pacific Ocean. The numerical results show
clearly the co-existence of the leading locked waves, propagating with the
speed of the atmospheric pressure waves (~1,100 km/hr), and the trailing free
waves, propagating with long gravity ocean wave celerity (~ 750 km/hr). During
the event, tsunamis were reported by 41 DART buoys in the Pacific Ocean, which
require corrections because of the occurrence of atmospheric pressure waves.
The numerically simulated tsunami arrival time and the amplitudes of the wave
crest and trough of the leading locked waves compare reasonably well with the
corrected DART measurements. The comparisons for the trailing waves are less
satisfactory, since free waves could also have been generated by other tsunami
generation mechanisms, which have not been considered in the present model, and
by the scattering of locked waves over changing bathymetry. In this regard, the
numerical results show clearly that the deep Tonga trench (~ 10 km) amplifies

more and more crucial. Among many factors, data with missing values is one
primary issue, and thus developing effective imputation models is a key topic
in the research community. Recently, a major research direction is to employ
neural network models such as selforganizing mappings or automatic encoders for
filling missing values. However, these classical methods can hardly discover
correlation features and common features simultaneously among data attributes.
Especially,it is a very typical problem for classical autoencoders that they
often learn invalid constant mappings, thus dramatically hurting the filling
performance. To solve the above problems, we propose and develop a
missing-value-filling model based on a feature-fusion-enhanced autoencoder. We
first design and incorporate into an autoencoder a hidden layer that consists
of de-tracking neurons and radial basis function neurons, which can enhance the
ability to learn correlated features and common features. Besides, we develop a
missing value filling strategy based on dynamic clustering (MVDC) that is
incorporated into an iterative optimization process. This design can enhance
the multi-dimensional feature fusion ability and thus improves the dynamic
collaborative missing-value-filling performance. The effectiveness of our model
is validated by experimental comparisons to many missing-value-filling methods
that are tested on seven datasets with different missing rates.

the leading astronomical research institutes in the world. When van Rhijn took
over at the retirement of Kapteyn, it was in the process of coordinating
Kapteyn's Plan of Selected Areas. Van Rhijn's research was solid and
professional work, but in his papers he invariably stopped before discussing
how his findings did fit into the larger scheme of things. He maybe was
unimaginative but it did lack the link to the larger view towards the emerging
picture of the structure of the Galaxy. Van Rhijn was unfortunate to be
hampered throughout almost his complete directorate by factors, that severely
limited his attempts to obtain more funding in spite of local support by his
university. These were of course in the first place the Great Depression of the
1930s and the Second World War and its aftermath, while during most of the
1940s he suffered from tuberculosis. But also the remote location of Groningen
compared to Leiden, where a major infrastructure led by three important
protegees of Kapteyn was in place, and the governmental bias towards support
for Leiden over Groningen was an important factor. Finally I examine the
developments in the 1950s and the circumstances that made Adriaan Blaauw accept

($\left|b\right|> 1^{\circ}$) in the Galactic bulge region ($-8^{\circ}.3<
l<9^{\circ}.4$) using a clean sample of the photometric data of $7,440$ stars
recently released by the OGLE-IV project. The geometrical parameters of the
bulge are determined based on Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis in
five-dimensional parameter space. More refined values of these parameters as
well as their uncertainties are obtained from a fully Bayesian Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. Approximating the bulge as an ellipsoid, the
distribution of the number density of stars as a function of Galacto-centric
distance has been modelled using three distribution functions: two Exponential
($\rm E_{1},\rm E_{2}$) types and one Gaussian ($\rm G$) type. Based on the AIC
and BIC values, the exponential model $\rm E_{1}$ is chosen as the best
statistical model for the parameter values obtained from the MCMC analysis. The
MCMC analysis yields the following results: the mean distance to the Galactic
center (GC) is found to be $R_{0}=8.034\pm0.012_{\rm stat}\pm0.586_{\rm sys}$
kpc; the bulge $\delta$ Scuti distribution has a triaxial shape with normalized
($a\equiv1$) axes ratios ($a:b:c$) as $1.000\pm
0.005:0.348\pm0.002:0.421\pm0.002$. Here $a$ is the semi-major axis lying in
the Galactic plane and pointing towards us; $b$ and $c$ are the two semi-minor
axes, the former lying in the Galactic plane and the later perpendicular to it.
Smaller values of $b$ as compared to $a$ obtained for Galacto-centric distances
$R\ge 2.0$~kpc indicate the presence of a bar-like structure of the bulge with
a bar angle of $22^{\circ}.006\pm2^{\circ}.078$.

such problems without having to commit to early trade-offs. Surprisingly,
statistical learning theory so far offers almost no insight into the

demonstrate spatio-temporal control of the BEC density distribution through the
excitation of magnon supercurrents in an inhomogeneously magnetized yttrium
iron garnet film. The BEC is created by microwave parametric pumping and probed
by Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy. The desired magnetization profile
is prepared by heating the film with optical patterns projected onto its

observe a pronounced spatially localized magnon accumulation caused by magnon
supercurrents flowing toward each other originating in two heated regions. This
accumulation effect increases the BEC lifetime due to the constant influx of
condensed magnons into the confinement region. The shown approach to manipulate
coherent waves provides an opportunity to extend the lifetime of freely
evolving magnon BECs, create dynamic magnon textures, and study the interaction
of magnon condensates formed in different regions of the sample.

modal functions, where general boundary conditions are prescribed. For this
purpose, the modal function each is expressed as a linear combination of the
corner function, the two boundary functions and the internal function, to
ensure the series expressions obtained uniformly convergent and termwise
differentiable up to second order. Meanwhile, the sum of the corner function
and the internal function corresponds to the particular solution, and the two
boundary functions correspond to the general solutions which satisfy the
homogeneous form of the equations. Since the general solutions have
appropriately interpreted the meaning of the differential equations, the

designing any process reengineering procedure is to find process improvement
opportunities. In existing work, it is usually assumed that the set of

finding the root causes and the treatments for the problem in those process

many process enhancement opportunities, not captured by these problematic

random assemblies of macroscale chains -- including steel bead chains and
cooked spaghetti -- under oscillatory shear. We show that a universal
transition from localized to wide shear zones occurs upon increasing the strain
amplitude, for a wide range of lengths, flexibilities, and other structural
parameters of the constituent elements. The critical strain amplitude coincides
with the onset of strain stiffening development in the system. We obtain
scaling laws for transition sharpness, shear-zone width, and stiffness
enhancement as a function of chain length. Our findings suggest that the
entanglements between the constituent elements strengthen when approaching the
critical strain amplitude and rapidly become long range, even spanning the
entire finite system for long enough chains. We show that the nonlinear
rheological response is governed by the interplay between increasing stored
elastic forces due to entanglements and increasing contribution of dissipation
with shear rate and interlocking between chains.

of four studied diffuse bands (5780, 5797, 6196 and 6614 \AA) demonstrate
strong variability sometimes doubling the features' width. Despite the high
magnitude of the effect, our current analysis is restricted to the strongest
diffuse bands because the weaker ones require a much higher S/N ratio. The
profile broadening in the studied DIBs moves the profile's centers towards
longer wavelengths, probably due to the excitation of higher levels of the P
branch of the unknown molecular carrier. Moreover, diffuse bands are broader in
clouds with abundantly populated vibrationally excited states of the hydrogen
molecules, i.e. DIB's broadening correlates with the rotational temperature
estimated on H$_2$ $\nu$=2 vibrational level. However, objects demonstrating
extremely broadened profiles of DIBs are scarce. The extreme peculiarity of
DIBs' profiles was detected in Herschel~36. Here we show the gradual growths of
the widths of diffuse bands, confirmed in spectra from different instruments.

million papers indexed in the Web of Science published by 1.1 million authors
from MENA between 2008 and 2020. We used bibliometric indicators to analyse
potential disparities between men and women in the share of authors, research
productivity, and seniority in authorship. The results show that gender parity
is far from being achieved in MENA. Overall, men authors obtain higher
representation, research productivity, and seniority. But some countries
standout: Tunisia, Lebanon, Turkey, Algeria and Egypt have higher shares or
women researchers compared to the rest of MENA countries. The UAE, Qatar, and
Jordan have shown progress in terms of women participation in science, but
Saudi Arabia lags behind. We find that women are more likely to stop publishing
than men and that men publish on average between 11% and 51% more than women,
with this gap increasing over time. Finally, men, on average, achieved senior
positions in authorship faster than women. Our longitudinal study contributes
to a better understanding of gender disparities in science in MENA which is
catching up in terms of policy engagement and women representation. However,
the results suggest that the effects of the policy changes have yet to

microscopic theoretical study of the leading superconducting instabilities on
the kagome lattice based on spin- and charge-fluctuation mediated Cooper
pairing. The applied methodology includes effects of both on-site and
nearest-neighbor repulsive Coulomb interactions. Near the upper van Hove
filling -- relevant for the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ materials -- we find a rich phase
diagram with several pairing symmetries being nearly degenerate. In particular,
while a substantial fraction of the phase diagram is occupied by a spin-singlet
order parameter transforming as a two-dimensional irreducible representation of
the point group, several nodal spin-triplet pairing states remain competitive.
We compute the band and interaction parameter-dependence of the hierarchy of
the leading superconducting instabilities, and determine the detailed momentum
dependence of the resulting preferred gap structures. Crucially, for moderate
values of the interaction parameters, the individual pairing states depend
strongly on momentum and exhibit multiple nodes on the Fermi surface. We
discuss the properties of these superconducting gap structures in light of
recent experimental developments of the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ materials.

scenarios remain uncertain. Whether thick disks form through slow or fast,
internal or environmental, processes is unclear. The physical origin of outer
truncations in thin and thick disks, observed as a drop in optical and
near-infrared (NIR) surface brightness profiles, is also a much debated topic.
These truncations have been linked to star formation (SF) thresholds in
Milky-Way type galaxies, but no such connection has been made for their
low-mass counterparts or in thick disks. Our photometric analysis of the
edge-on galaxy UGC 7321 offers a possible breakthrough. This well-studied
diffuse, isolated, bulgeless, ultra-thin galaxy is thought to be under-evolved
both dynamically and in SF. It is an ideal target to disentangle internal
effects in the formation of thick disks and truncations. Our axial light
profiles from deep far- and near-ultraviolet (UV; GALEX) images, tracing recent
SF, and optical (DESI grz) and NIR (Spitzer 3.6 microns) images, tracing old
stellar populations, enable a detailed identification of an outer truncation in
all probed wavelengths in both the thin and thick disks. After deprojecting to
a face-on view, a sharp truncation signature is found at a stellar density of
roughly 1.5 solar masses per square parsec, in agreement with theoretical
expectations of gas density SF thresholds. The redder colours beyond the
truncation radius are indicative of stellar migration towards the outer
regions. We thus show that thick disks and truncations can form via internal
mechanisms alone, given the pristine nature of UGC 7321. We report the
discovery of a truncation at and above the mid-plane of a diffuse galaxy that
is linked to a SF threshold; this poses a constraint on physically-motivated
disk size measurements among low-mass galaxies.

particularly in ad-hoc deployments. Recent solutions include dynamic allocation
of active and passive localization modes for different robots or nodes in the
system. With larger-scale systems becoming more distributed, key research
questions arise in the areas of security and trustability of such localization
systems. This paper studies the potential integration of collaborative-decision
making processes with distributed ledger technologies. Specifically, we
investigate the design and implementation of a methodology for running an UWB
role allocation algorithm within smart contracts in a blockchain. In previous
works, we have separately studied the integration of ROS2 with the Hyperledger
Fabric blockchain, and introduced a new algorithm for scalable UWB-based
localization. In this paper, we extend these works by (i) running experiments
with larger number of mobile robots switching between different spatial
configurations and (ii) integrating the dynamic UWB role allocation algorithm
into Fabric smart contracts for distributed decision-making in a system of
multiple mobile robots. This enables us to deliver the same functionality
within a secure and trustable process, with enhanced identity and data access
management. Our results show the effectiveness of the UWB role allocation for
continuously varying spatial formations of six autonomous mobile robots, while
demonstrating a low impact on latency and computational resources of adding the

of single qubit gates that anticommutes with some subset of terms in the
quantum Hamiltonian, and the controlled reversal gate $C_R$ is the
implementation of $R$ controlled by the ancilla qubit. By flipping the sign of
terms in the Hamiltonian, the flow of time is toggled forwards and backwards
depending on the state of the ancilla. In this work, we use controlled reversal
gates and the rodeo algorithm to compute the energy spectrum of a two-qubit
Hamiltonian; the use of controlled reversal gates provides a five-fold
reduction in the number of two-qubit entangling gates needed for the example
considered here. We use the Quantinuum H1-2 and IBM Perth devices to realize
the quantum circuits. While the Quantinuum H1-2 achieves a significantly lower
error rate than the IBM Perth, we were able to determine the energy levels on
both devices with an error of less than 0.06% of the full span of the energy

supernovae. The quasi-periodic variability has been detected in the optical
light curves of SSSs. However, the exact origin of such quasi-periodic
observable features remains a mystery. In this paper, we aim to reproduce the
observed optical quasi-periodic variability of SSSs by proposing a white dwarf
(WD) accretion model with a periodic mass transfer caused by the irradiation of
supersoft X-ray onto the companion star. Methods. Assuming that a periodic mass
transfer from the companion star to the WD can be caused while the supersoft
X-ray irradiates the companion star, we used MESA to simulate the WD accretion
process and the subsequent WD evolution by adopting a periodic jagged accretion
rate. Comparing our results to the optical light curves of a well-observed SSS
RX J0513.9-6951, we find that our models can reproduce the quasi-periodic
transition between the optical high and low states of RX J0513.9-6951 because
the periodic accretion rate can lead to the WD photosphere expands and
contracts periodically in our models. In addition, we find that the
transitional periods of the SSSs in our models strongly depend on the mass of
the accreting WDs. The more massive the WD mass is, the shorter the
transitional period. Based on our results, we suggest that the periodic mass
transfer caused by the irradiation of supersoft X-ray onto the companion star
may be the origin of the observed optical quasi-periodic variability in SSSs.
In addition, our results indicate that the observed optical transition period
of a SSS may be useful for the rough estimate of the mass of an accreting WD.

advances in fine- and coarse-grained dynamic information-flow control (IFC)
security. Since the 70s, the programming language and the operating system
communities have proposed different IFC approaches. IFC operating systems track
information flows in a coarse-grained fashion, at the granularity of a process.
In contrast, traditional language-based approaches to IFC are fine-grained:
they track information flows at the granularity of program variables. For
decades, researchers believed coarse-grained IFC to be strictly less permissive
than fine-grained IFC -- coarse-grained IFC systems seem inherently less
precise because they track less information -- and so granularity appeared to
be a fundamental feature of IFC systems. We show that the granularity of the
tracking system does not fundamentally restrict how precise or permissive
dynamic IFC systems can be. To this end, we mechanize two mostly standard
languages, one with a fine-grained dynamic IFC system and the other with a
coarse-grained dynamic IFC system, and prove a semantics-preserving translation
from each language to the other. In addition, we derive the standard security
property of non-interference of each language from that of the other via our
verified translation. These translations stand to have important implications
on the usability of IFC approaches. The coarse- to fine-grained direction can
be used to remove the label annotation burden that fine-grained systems impose
on developers, while the fine- to coarse-grained translation shows that
coarse-grained systems -- which are easier to design and implement -- can track
information as precisely as fine-grained systems and provides an algorithm for
automatically retrofitting legacy applications to run on existing
coarse-grained systems.

measurements of accretion variability from the youngest protostars are rare, as
they are still deeply embedded within their envelopes. Sub-mm/mm observations
can trace the thermal response of dust in the envelope to accretion luminosity
changes, allowing variations in the accretion rate to be quantified. In this
paper, we present contemporaneous sub-mm/mm light curves of variable protostars
in Serpens Main, as observed by the ALMA ACA, SMA, and JCMT. The most recent
outburst of EC 53 (V371 Ser), an $\sim 18$ month periodic variable, is
well-sampled in the SMA and JCMT observations. The SMA light curve of EC 53 is
observed to peak weeks earlier and exhibit a stronger amplitude than at the
JCMT. Stochastic variations in the ACA observations are detected for SMM 10 IR
with a factor $\sim 2$ greater amplitude than as seen by the JCMT. We develop a
toy model of the envelope response to accretion outbursts to show EC 53's light
curves are plausibly explained by the delay associated with the light travel
time across the envelope and the additional dilution of the JCMT response by
the incorporation of cold envelope material in the beam. The larger JCMT beam
can also wash out the response to rapid variations, which may be occurring for
SMM 10 IR. Our work thus provides a valuable proof of concept for the usage of
sub-mm/mm observations as a probe of both the underlying accretion luminosity
variations and the protostellar environment.

after its discovery, its chemistry remains poorly known and even basic
questions are not yet satisfactorily addressed. In this work, we perform a
systematic study of the geometries, interactions energies and bonding in basic
polonium(IV) species, namely the hydrated [Po(H$_2$O)$_n$]$^{4+}$ and
chlorinated [PoCl$_n$]$^{4-n}$ complexes by means of gas-phase electronic

in the first coordination sphere of the polonium(IV) ion, its coordination
sphere can already be filled with eight chloride ligands. Capitalising on
previous theoretical studies, a focused methodological study based on
interaction energies and bond distances allows us to validate the MP2/def2-
TZVP level of theory for future ground-state studies. After discussing
similarities and differences between complexes with the same number of ligands,
we perform topological analyses of the MP2 electron densities in the quantum
theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) fashion. While the water complexes display
typical signatures of closed-shell interactions, we reveal large Po-Cl
delocalisation indices, especially in the hypothetical [PoCl]$^{3+}$ complex.
This ""enhanced"" covalency opens the way for a significant spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) effect on the corresponding bond distance, which has been studied by two
independent approaches (i.e. one a priori and one a posteriori). We finally
conclude by stressing that while the SOC may not affect much the geometries of
high-coordinated polonium(IV) complexes, it should definitely not be neglected
in the case of low-coordinated ones.

causally interpretable dependence structure in multivariate data by treating
each independent observation as a one-time cross-sectional snapshot of a
temporal process. Specifically, the models assume the observations to be
cross-sections of independent multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes in
equilibrium. The Gaussian equilibrium exists under a stability assumption on
the drift matrix, and the equilibrium covariance matrix is determined by the
continuous Lyapunov equation. Each graphical continuous Lyapunov model assumes
the drift matrix to be sparse with a support determined by a directed graph. A
natural approach to model selection in this setting is to use an
$\ell_1$-regularization approach that seeks to find a sparse approximate
solution to the Lyapunov equation when given a sample covariance matrix. We
study the model selection properties of the resulting lasso technique by
applying the primal-dual witness technique for support recovery. Our analysis
uses special spectral properties of the Hessian of the considered loss function
in order to arrive at a consistency result. While the lasso technique is able
to recover useful structure, our results also demonstrate that the relevant
irrepresentability condition may be violated in subtle ways, preventing perfect

of about 0.2 at room temperature regardless of the magnetic alloys, which is
comparable to typical heavy metals (HMs). Furthermore, we achieve SOT-driven

parameters and partly to unqualified claims in the literature stating that
geostatistical data have little or no information about the smoothness

languages like C and C++. Unfortunately, memory-unsafe C code remains unsafe
when compiled to Wasm -- and attackers can exploit buffer overflows and
use-after-frees in Wasm almost as easily as they can on native platforms.
Memory-Safe WebAssembly (MSWasm) proposes to extend Wasm with language-level
memory-safety abstractions to precisely address this problem. In this paper, we
build on the original MSWasm position paper to realize this vision. We give a
precise and formal semantics of MSWasm, and prove that well-typed MSWasm
programs are, by construction, robustly memory safe. To this end, we develop a
novel, language-independent memory-safety property based on colored memory
locations and pointers. This property also lets us reason about the security
guarantees of a formal C-to-MSWasm compiler -- and prove that it always
produces memory-safe programs (and preserves the semantics of safe programs).
We use these formal results to then guide several implementations: Two
compilers of MSWasm to native code, and a C-to-MSWasm compiler (that extends
Clang). Our MSWasm compilers support different enforcement mechanisms, allowing
developers to make security-performance trade-offs according to their needs.
Our evaluation shows that the overhead of enforcing memory safety in software
ranges from 22% (enforcing spatial safety alone) to 198% (enforcing full memory
safety) on the PolyBenchC suite. More importantly, MSWasm's design makes it
easy to swap between enforcement mechanisms; as fast (especially
hardware-based) enforcement techniques become available, MSWasm will be able to
take advantage of these advances almost for free.

the Norwegian continental shelf. The study aims to leverage spatial
dependencies through the relative physical location of different measurement
stations to improve local wind forecasts. Our multi-step forecasting models
produce either 10-minute, 1- or 4-hour forecasts, with 10-minute resolution,
meaning that the models produce more informative time series for predicted
future trends. A graph neural network (GNN) architecture was used to extract
spatial dependencies, with different update functions to learn temporal
correlations. These update functions were implemented using different neural
network architectures. One such architecture, the Transformer, has become
increasingly popular for sequence modelling in recent years. Various
alterations have been proposed to better facilitate time series forecasting, of
which this study focused on the Informer, LogSparse Transformer and Autoformer.
This is the first time the LogSparse Transformer and Autoformer have been
applied to wind forecasting and the first time any of these or the Informer
have been formulated in a spatio-temporal setting for wind forecasting. By
comparing against spatio-temporal Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) models, the study showed that the models using the altered
Transformer architectures as update functions in GNNs were able to outperform
these. Furthermore, we propose the Fast Fourier Transformer (FFTransformer),
which is a novel Transformer architecture based on signal decomposition and
consists of two separate streams that analyse the trend and periodic components
separately. The FFTransformer and Autoformer were found to achieve superior
results for the 10-minute and 1-hour ahead forecasts, with the FFTransformer
significantly outperforming all other models for the 4-hour ahead forecasts.

electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, enabled by the development
of operational Single Microwave Photon Detectors (SMPD) at millikelvin

fluorescence signal. The echo manifests itself as a coherent modulation of the
number of photons spontaneously emitted after a $\pi/2_X - \tau - \pi_Y - \tau

experimentally this detection method using an ensemble of $\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$
ion spins in a scheelite crystal of $\mathrm{CaWO}_4$. We use
fluorescence-detected echoes to measure the erbium spin coherence time, as well
as the echo envelope modulation due to the coupling to the $^{183}\mathrm{W}$
nuclear spins surrounding each ion. We finally compare the signal-to-noise
ratio of inductively-detected and fluorescence-detected echoes, and show that
it is larger with the fluorescence method.

This phenomenon appears in many forms, of which the concept of non-joint
measurability has received considerable attention in the recent years. In order
to characterise this non-classical phenomenon, various analytical and numerical
methods have been developed. The analytical approaches have mostly concentrated
on the qubit case, as well as to scenarios involving sets of measurements with
symmetries, such as position and momentum or sets of mutually unbiased bases.
The numerical methods can, in principle, decide any finite-dimensional and
discrete joint measurability problem, but they naturally have practical
limitations in terms of computational power. These methods exclusively start
from a given set of measurements and ask whether the set possesses
incompatibility. Here, we take a complementary approach by asking which
measurements are compatible with a given measurement. It turns out, that this
question can be answered in full generality through a minimal Naimark dilation
of the given measurement: the set of interest is exactly those measurements
that have a block-diagonal representation in such dilation. We demonstrate the
use of the technique through various qubit examples, leading to an alternative
characterisation of all compatible pairs of binary qubit measurements, which
retrieves the celebrated Busch criterion. We further apply the technique to
special examples of trinary and continuous qubit measurements.

  overlap with arXiv:2112.09697",,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a sampling best-first method to search for
optimal decisions. The success of MCTS depends heavily on how the tree is built
and the selection process plays a fundamental role in this. One particular
selection mechanism that has proved to be reliable is based on the Upper
Confidence Bounds for Trees (UCT). The UCT attempts to balance exploration and
exploitation by considering the values stored in the statistical tree of the
MCTS. However, some tuning of the MCTS UCT is necessary for this to work well.
In this work, we use Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to evolve mathematical
expressions with the goal to substitute the UCT formula and use the evolved
expressions in MCTS. More specifically, we evolve expressions by means of our
proposed Semantic-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm in MCTS approach (SIEA-MCTS).
This is inspired by semantics in Genetic Programming (GP), where the use of
fitness cases is seen as a requirement to be adopted in GP. Fitness cases are
normally used to determine the fitness of individuals and can be used to
compute the semantic similarity (or dissimilarity) of individuals. However,
fitness cases are not available in MCTS. We extend this notion by using
multiple reward values from MCTS that allow us to determine both the fitness of
an individual and its semantics. By doing so, we show how SIEA-MCTS is able to
successfully evolve mathematical expressions that yield better or competitive
results compared to UCT without the need of tuning these evolved expressions.
We compare the performance of the proposed SIEA-MCTS against MCTS algorithms,
MCTS Rapid Action Value Estimation algorithms, three variants of the *-minimax
family of algorithms, a random controller and two more EA approaches. We
consistently show how SIEA-MCTS outperforms most of these intelligent
controllers in the challenging game of Carcassonne.

parton distribution functions of nucleons and nuclei to transport properties in

physics. This real-time physics often defies a perturbative treatment and the
most successful strategy so far is to deploy lattice QCD simulations. These
numerical computations are based on Monte-Carlo sampling and formulated in an
artificial Euclidean time. Real-time physics is most conveniently formulated in
terms of spectral functions, which are hidden in lattice QCD behind an
ill-posed inverse problem. I will discuss the current methods state-of-the art
in the extraction of spectral functions from lattice QCD simulations, based on
Bayesian inference and emphasize the importance of prior domain knowledge,
vital to regularizing the otherwise ill-posed extraction task. With Bayesian
inference allowing us to make explicit the uncertainty in both observations and
in our prior knowledge, a systematic estimation of the total uncertainties in
the extracted spectral functions is nowadays possible. Two implementations of
the Bayesian Reconstruction (BR) method for spectral function extraction, one
for MAP point estimates and one based on an open access Monte-Carlo sampler are
provided.I will briefly touch on the use of machine learning for spectral
function reconstruction and discuss some new insight it has brought to the
Bayesian community.

O}(1/T)$, must reveal quark- and gluon-like quasi-particles when probed with
sufficiently high momentum transfer, since QCD is asymptotically free. High
energy jet partons traversing the droplet of QGP produced in a heavy ion
collision can trigger these high-momentum exchanges with medium constituents
and so have the potential to reveal the presence of such quasi-particles, a key
step toward the experimental study of the microscopic structure of QGP. We
implement this physics within the hybrid strong/weak coupling model which,
prior to this work, only accounted for nonperturbative aspects of parton energy
loss. Elastic Moli\`ere scatterings between partons from a jet shower and
medium quasi-particles result in deflection of the propagating jet partons and
struck thermal medium partons recoiling at large angles. We discuss the effect
of Moli\`ere scatterings on some of the most widely used groomed and ungroomed
jet substructure observables. Given the large impact on jet observables of the
wakes generated by the hydrodynamic response of the QGP fluid as the shower and
scattered partons lose energy and momentum to it, as well as the presence of
selection biases, finding distinctive signatures of Moli\`ere scattering, and
hence the presence of quasi-particles in QGP, is a challenge. Toward this end,
we emphasize the discovery potential of subjet (jets within jets)
distributions.

This framework allows for both explicit and spontaneous CP violation. CP can be
explicitly violated when the coefficients of the potential are taken to be
complex. With coefficients chosen to be real, CP can be spontaneously violated
via complex vacuum expectation values (vevs). In the absence of the terms
leading to the possibility of CP violation, either explicit or induced by
complex vevs, the potential has two global U(1) symmetries. In this case,
spontaneous symmetry breaking would in general give rise to massless states. In
a realistic implementation, those terms must be included, thus preventing the
existence of Goldstone bosons. A scan over parameters, imposing the existence
of a neutral state at 125 GeV that is nearly CP-even, typically results in the
existence of one or two states with masses below 125 GeV that have a
significant CP-odd component. These light states would have a low production
rate via the Bjorken process and could thus have escaped detection at LEP.

sampling points used in several approaches are (1) structured points connected
with fast algorithms or (2) unstructured points coming from, e.g., an initial
random draw to achieve an improved information complexity. We connect both
approaches and propose a subsampling of structured points in an offline step.
In particular, we start with structured quadrature points (QMC), which provide
stable $L_2$ reconstruction properties. The subsampling procedure consists of a
computationally inexpensive random step followed by a deterministic procedure
to further reduce the number of points while keeping its information. In these
points functions (belonging to a RKHS of bounded functions) will be sampled and
reconstructed from whilst achieving state of the art error decay. Our method is
dimension-independent and is applicable as soon as we know some initial
quadrature points. We apply our general findings on the $d$-dimensional torus
to subsample rank-1 lattices, where it is known that full rank-1 lattices lose
half the optimal order of convergence (expressed in terms of the size of the
lattice). In contrast to that, our subsampled version regains the optimal rate
since many of the lattice points are not needed. Moreover, we utilize fast and

magnetic field where these terms compete with the gyration effect of the
magnetic field. In this latter case, we concentrate on the ultra-quantum limit
where the Fermi level lies in the chiral Landau level and the Kerr and
ellipticity angles have more complex frequency and magnetic field behaviors.

cores (FHSC) have been searched for in the interstellar medium for nearly two
decades now. Distinguishing them from other types of more evolved but still
embedded objects remains a challenge because these objects have a short
lifetime, are small, and embedded in a dense cocoon. One possible lead to
finding them is the characterization of the outflows that are launched by these
objects. We observed the L1451-mm FHSC candidate with the NOEMA interferometer
in order to study the emission of several molecules. A nonlocal thermodynamic
equilibrium analysis of the CH$_3$OH detected lines was performed to retrieve
the physical conditions of the emitting region around the central source,
together with the CH$_3$OH, SiO, CS, and H$_2$CO column densities. Of the
targeted molecules, we detected lines of c-C$_3$H$_2$, CH$_3$OH, CS, C$^{34}$S,
SO, DCN, DCO$^+$, H$_2$CO, HC$_3$N, HDCO, and SiO. One of the methanol lines
appears to be a maser line. The detection of this class I maser and the SiO
line in L1451-mm support the presence of a low-velocity and compact outflow.
The excitation conditions of the thermal lines of methanol are also compatible
with shocks (H$_2$ density of $\sim 3\times 10^6$~cm$^{-3}$ and a temperature
higher than 40~K). Although these low-velocity outflows are theoretically
predicted by some models of FHSC, these models also predict the shock
temperature to be below 20~K, that is, not evaporating methanol. In addition,
the predicted velocities would not erode the grains and release silicon in the
gas phase. We therefore conclude that these new observations favor the
hypothesis that L1451-mm would be at a very early protostellar stage, launching
an outflow nearly on the plane of the sky with a higher velocity than is
observed.

three aspects of this mapping. First, our original mapping was not valid
non-perturbatively in $1/N$, since it did not include non-local correlations
between the gravity fields which appear at finite $N$. We show that by using a
bi-local $G-\Sigma$ type formalism similar to the one used in the SYK model, we
can construct an exact mapping to the bulk that is valid also at finite $N$.
The theory in the bulk contains additional auxiliary fields which implement the
finite $N$ constraints. Second, we discuss the generalization of our mapping to
the field theory on $S^d$, and in particular how the sphere free energy matches
exactly between the two sides, and how the mapping can be consistently
regularized. Finally, we discuss the field theory at finite temperature, and
show that the low-temperature phase of the vector models can be mapped to a
high-spin gravity theory on thermal AdS space.

methods to approximate multivariate integrals.
  A rank-$1$ lattice rule to approximate an $s$-dimensional integral is fully
specified by its \emph{generating vector} $\boldsymbol{z} \in \mathbb{Z}^s$ and
its number of points~$N$.
  While there are many results on the existence of ``good'' rank-$1$ lattice
rules, there are no explicit constructions of good generating vectors for
dimensions $s \ge 3$.
  This is why one usually resorts to computer search algorithms. In a recent
paper by Ebert et al. in the Journal of Complexity, we showed a

  limited to product weights. In the present paper, we shall generalize this
result to arbitrary positive weights, thereby answering an open question posed
  in the paper of Ebert et al. We also include a short section on how the
algorithm can be implemented in the case of POD weights, by which we see that
the CBC-DBD construction is competitive with the classical CBC construction.

calculations, we demonstrate that the Janus 2H-GdIBr monolayer exhibits an
intrinsic ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductor character with an indirect band gap
of 0.75 eV, high Curie temperature T$_{c}$ of 260 K, significant magnetic
moment of 8 $\mu_{B}$/f.u. (f.u.=formula unit), in-plane magnetic anisotropy
(IMA) and large spontaneous valley polarization of 118 meV. The MAE,
inter-atomic distance or angle, and T$_{c}$ can be efficiently modulated by
in-plane strains and charge carrier doping. Under the strain range from $-$5%
to 5% and charge carrier doping from $-$0.3e to 0.3e/f.u., the system still
remains FM ordering and the corresponding T$_{c}$ can be modulated by strains
from 233 K to 281 K and by charge carrier doping from 140 K to 245 K.
Interestingly, under various strains, the matrix elements differences
($d_{z^{2}}$, $d_{yz}$), ($d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$, $d_{xy}$) and ($p_{x}$, $p_{y}$)
of Gd atoms dominate the MAE behaviors, which originates from the competition
between the contributions of Gd-$d$, Gd-$p$ orbitals, and $p$ orbitals of
halogen atoms based on the second-order perturbation theory. Inequivalent Dirac
valleys are not energetic degenerate due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking
in the Janus 2H-GdIBr monolayer. A considerable valley gap between the Berry
curvature at the K and K$^{\prime}$ points provides an opportunity to
selectively control the valley freedom and to manipulate the anomalous Hall
effect. External tensile (compressive) strain further increases (decreases) the
valley gap up to a maximum (minimum) value of 158 (37) meV, indicating that the
valley polarization in the Janus 2H-GdIBr monolayer is robust to the external
strains.

emits at mid-infrared wavelengths via highly excited rotational lines. These
lines have only been detected with Spitzer in several proto-planetary disks and
shocks. Previous studies have shown they are a unique diagnostic for water
photodissociation. Thanks to its high sensitivity and angular resolution, the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could be able to detect them in other
environments such as interstellar Photo-Dissociation Regions (PDRs). In order
to predict the emerging spectrum of OH, we use the Meudon PDR Code to compute
the thermal and chemical structure of PDRs. The influence of thermal pressure
($P_{\rm th}/k$ = $n_{\rm H} T_{\rm K}$) and UV field strength on the
integrated intensities, as well as their detectability with the JWST are
studied in details. OH mid-IR emission is predicted to originate very close to
the H$^0$/H$_2$ transition and is directly proportional to the column density
of water photodissociated in that layer. Because neutral gas-phase formation of
water requires relatively high temperatures ($T_{\rm K} \gtrsim 300~$K), the
resulting OH mid-IR lines are primarily correlated with the temperature at this
position, and are therefore brighter in regions with high pressure. This
implies that these lines are predicted to be only detectable in strongly
irradiated PDRs ($G_0^{\rm incident}$ $>$ 10$^3$) with high thermal pressure
($P_{\rm th}/k$ $\gtrsim$ 5$\times$10$^7$ K cm$^{-3}$). In the latter case, OH
mid-IR lines are less dependent on the strength of the incident UV field. The
detection in PDRs like the Orion bar, which should be possible, is also
investigated. To conclude, OH mid-IR lines observable by JWST are a promising
diagnostics for dense and strongly irradiated PDRs.

happen when they are sent to a full queue. In this work, we implemented a
communication channel for the agents to share their information in order to
reduce the packet drop rate. For efficient information sharing we use an
attention-based communication model, called ATVC, to select informative
messages from other agents. The agents then infer the state of queues using a
combination of the variational auto-encoder, VAE, and product-of-experts, PoE,

Balanced Neural Ratio Estimation (BNRE), a variation of the NRE algorithm
designed to produce posterior approximations that tend to be more conservative,
hence improving their reliability, while sharing the same Bayes optimal
solution. We achieve this by enforcing a balancing condition that increases the
quantified uncertainty in small simulation budget regimes while still
converging to the exact posterior as the budget increases. We provide
theoretical arguments showing that BNRE tends to produce posterior surrogates
that are more conservative than NRE's. We evaluate BNRE on a wide variety of
tasks and show that it produces conservative posterior surrogates on all tested
benchmarks and simulation budgets. Finally, we emphasize that BNRE is
straightforward to implement over NRE and does not introduce any computational

existing foundation models such as CLIP to boost the performance of the image
encoder. Although pretrained on four times less data, our ViCHA strategy

In this survey, we present a comprehensive review on deep learning approaches

engineering domains such as mobile apps, web applications, or programming

challenging human players is a daunting task for automatic test generators.
Even if test generation succeeds in finding a relevant sequence of events to
exercise a program, the randomized nature of games means that it may neither be
possible to reproduce the exact program behavior underlying this sequence, nor
to create test assertions checking if observed randomized game behavior is
correct. To overcome these problems, we propose Neatest, a novel test generator
based on the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm. Neatest
systematically explores a program's statements, and creates neural networks
that operate the program in order to reliably reach each statement -- that is,
Neatest learns to play the game in a way to reliably cover different parts of
the code. As the networks learn the actual game behavior, they can also serve
as test oracles by evaluating how surprising the observed behavior of a program
under test is compared to a supposedly correct version of the program. We
evaluate this approach in the context of Scratch, an educational programming
environment. Our empirical study on 25 non-trivial Scratch games demonstrates
that our approach can successfully train neural networks that are not only far
more resilient to random influences than traditional test suites consisting of
static input sequences, but are also highly effective with an average mutation
score of more than 65%.

understand how the first galaxies form stars and grow. Here we present deep
spectroscopic and continuum ALMA observations towards GHZ2/GLASS-z12, one of
the brightest and most robust candidates at $z > 10$ identified in the
GLASS-JWST Early Release Science Program. We detect a $5.8 \sigma$ line, offset
0.5"" from the JWST position of GHZ2/GLASS-z12 that, associating it with the
[OIII] 88 micron transition, implies a spectroscopic redshift of $z = 12.117

oxygen line luminosity places GHZ2/GLASS-z12 above the [OIII]-SFR relation for
metal-poor galaxies, implying an enhancement of [OIII] emission in this system
while the JWST-observed emission is likely a lower-metallicity region. The lack
of dust emission seen by these observations is consistent with the blue UV
slope observed by JWST, which suggest little dust attenuation in galaxies at
this early epoch. Further observations will unambiguously confirm the redshift

graphs for which data reduction techniques do not work well. To be more
precise, state-of-the-art branch-and-reduce algorithms can solve many
large-scale graphs if reductions are applicable. Otherwise, their performance
quickly degrades due to branching requiring exponential time. In this paper, we
develop an advanced memetic algorithm to tackle the problem, which incorporates
recent data reduction techniques to compute near-optimal weighted independent
sets in huge sparse networks. More precisely, we use a memetic approach to
recursively choose vertices that are likely to be in a large-weight independent

We show that identifying and removing vertices likely to be in large-weight
independent sets opens up the reduction space and speeds up the computation of
large-weight independent sets remarkably. Our experimental evaluation indicates
that we are able to outperform state-of-the-art algorithms. For example, our
two algorithm configurations compute the best results among all competing

Several scenarios may produce a narrow disk. However, simultaneously

massive disk beyond ~1.5 au on a 5-10 Myr timescale. The resulting terrestrial
systems reproduced the current orbits and masses of Venus, Earth and Mars.
Adding an inner region disk component within ~0.8-0.9 au allowed several
terrestrial systems to simultaneously form analogues of the four terrestrial

late impactors represented by disk objects formed within 2 au, and effective

demanding in computational power and memory. Light-based platforms promise
ultra-fast and energy-efficient hardware, which may help in realizing
next-generation data processing devices. However, current photonic networks are
limited by the number of input-output nodes that can be processed in a single
shot. This restricted network capacity prevents their application to relevant
large-scale problems such as natural language processing. Here, we realize a
photonic processor with a capacity exceeding $1.5 \times 10^{10}$ optical
nodes, more than one order of magnitude larger than any previous
implementation, which enables photonic large-scale text encoding and
classification. By exploiting the full three-dimensional structure of the
optical field propagating in free space, we overcome the interpolation
threshold and reach the over-parametrized region of machine learning, a
condition that allows high-performance natural language processing with a
minimal fraction of training points. Our results provide a novel solution to
scale-up light-driven computing and open the route to photonic language
processing.

combining two sets of observations: oxygen emissions at 1304 {\AA} and 1356
{\AA} from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectral images, and Galileo magnetic
field measurements from its closest encounter, the E12 flyby. We describe
Europa's atmosphere with three neutral gas species: global molecular
($\mathrm{O_2}$) and atomic oxygen (O), and localized water ($\mathrm{H_2O}$)
present as a near-equatorial plume and as a stable distribution concentrated
around the subsolar point on the moon's trailing hemisphere. Our combined
modelling based on the ratio of OI 1356 {\AA} to OI 1304 {\AA} emissions from
Roth (2021) and on magnetic field data allows us to derive constraints on the
density and location of $\mathrm{O_2}$ and $\mathrm{H_2O}$ in Europa's
atmosphere. We demonstrate that $50\%$ of the $\mathrm{O_2}$ and between $50\%$
and $75\%$ of the $\mathrm{H_2O}$ abundances from Roth (2021) are required to
jointly explain the HST and Galileo measurements. These values are conditioned
on a column density of $\mathrm{O}$ close to the upper limit of $6
\times10^{16}~\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ derived by Roth (2021), and on a strongly
confined stable $\mathrm{H_2O}$ atmosphere around the subsolar point. Our
analysis yields column densities of $1.2 \times10^{18}~\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ for
$\mathrm{O_2}$, and $1.5 \times10^{19}~\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ to $2.2

investigates whether the pixel centroids are located on a regular grid by
projecting laser speckle patterns through a double slit aperture onto a

centroid offsets from the stochastic speckle pattern. Due to the orientation of
the test setup, only x-offsets are measured here. We test the method both on
simulations, and by injecting artificial offsets into the real images. We use
cross-correlations of the reconstructions from different speckle realizations
to determine how much of the variance in the pixel offset maps is signal (fixed
to the detector) and how much is noise. After performing this reconstruction on
64x64 pixel patches, and fitting out the best-fit linear mapping from pixel
index to position, we find that there are residual centroid offsets in the x
(column) direction from a regular grid of 0.0107 pixels RMS (excluding shifts
of an entire row relative to another, which our speckle patterns cannot
constrain). This decreases to 0.0097 pix RMS if we consider residuals from a
quadratic rather than linear mapping. These RMS offsets include both the
physical pixel offsets, as well as any apparent offsets due to cross-talk and
remaining systematic errors in the reconstruction. We comment on the advantages

specifics of the radio emission mechanisms is still an open question. In order
to provide more information about the emission mechanisms, we studied a moving
type IV radio burst with fine structures (spike group) by using the high
resolution capability of Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) on Aug 25, 2014\textbf{
(SOLA-D-21-00188)}. We present a comparison of Nan\c{c}ay RadioHeliograph (NRH)
and the first LOFAR imaging data of type IV radio burst. The degree of circular
polarization (DCP) is calculated at frequencies in the range 20$\sim$180 MHz
using LOFAR data, and it was found that the value of DCP gradually increased
during the event, with values of 10\%$\sim$20\%. LOFAR interferometric data
were combined with white light observations in order to track the propagation
of this type IV. The kinematics shows a westward motion of the radio sources,
slower than the CME leading edge. The dynamic spectrum of LOFAR shows a large
number of fine structures with duration of less than 1s and high brightness
temperature ($T_\mathrm{B}$), i.e. $10^{12}$$\sim$$10^{13}$ K. The gradual
increase of DCP supports gyrosynchrotron emission as the most plausible
mechanism for the type IV. However, coherent emissions such as Electron
Cyclotron Maser (ECM) instability can be responsible for small scale fine
structures. Countless fine structures altogether were responsible for such high
$T_\mathrm{B}$.

intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices to achieve quantum advantage in
classically-intractable sampling tasks, the use of these devices for solving
more practically relevant computational problems remains a challenge. Proposals
for attaining practical quantum advantage typically involve parametrized
quantum circuits (PQCs), whose parameters can be optimized to find solutions to
diverse problems throughout quantum simulation and machine learning. However,
training PQCs for real-world problems remains a significant practical
challenge, largely due to the phenomenon of barren plateaus in the optimization
landscapes of randomly-initialized quantum circuits. In this work, we introduce
a scalable procedure for harnessing classical computing resources to determine
task-specific initializations of PQCs, which we show significantly improves the
trainability and performance of PQCs on a variety of problems. Given a specific
optimization task, this method first utilizes tensor network (TN) simulations
to identify a promising quantum state, which is then converted into gate
parameters of a PQC by means of a high-performance decomposition procedure. We
show that this task-specific initialization avoids barren plateaus, and
effectively translates increases in classical resources to enhanced performance
and speed in training quantum circuits. By demonstrating a means of boosting
limited quantum resources using classical computers, our approach illustrates
the promise of this synergy between quantum and quantum-inspired models in
quantum computing, and opens up new avenues to harness the power of modern
quantum hardware for realizing practical quantum advantage.

optical data alone is common in many astrophysical studies. However this
process is prone to large errors because at those temperatures the optical
bands are mostly sampling the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the spectrum. Here we
quantify these errors by simulating different blackbodies, sampling them in
various bands with realistic measurement errors, and re-fitting them to
blackbodies using two different methods and two different priors. We find that
when using only optical data, log-uniform priors perform better than uniform
priors. Still, measured temperatures of blackbodies above ~35,000K can be wrong
by ~10,000K, and only lower limits can be obtained for temperatures of
blackbodies hotter than ~50,000K. Bolometric luminosities estimated from
optical-only blackbody fits can be wrong by factors of 3-5. When adding
space-based ultraviolet data, these errors shrink significantly. For when such
data are not available, we provide plots and tables of the distributions of
true temperatures that can result in various measured temperatures. It is
important to take these distributions into account as systematic uncertainties

motion and later fully engulfing the drop. We study this flow using both
3-phase Lattice-Boltzmann simulations based on the conservative phase field
model and experiments. Inertially and viscously limited dynamics are explored
using the Ohnesorge number $Oh$ as a function of $R/H$, the ratio between the
initial drop radius $R$ and the film height $H$. Both regimes show that the
apparent spreading radius $r$ is fairly independent of the film height, and
scales with time $T$ as $r\sim T^{1/2}$ for $Oh\ll 1$ and for $Oh\gg 1$ as
$r\sim T^{2/5}$. For $Oh\gg 1$ we show experimentally that this immiscible
apparent spreading motion is analogous with the miscible drop-film coalescence

sufficient to measure a statistically significant variation in DM over a

training and inference stages that share the same feed-forward path through a
spatial transformation-based network (STN). The STN consists of a global
generative adversarial network (GlobalGAN) and a local GAN (LocalGAN) to
predict the coarse- and fine-scale motions, respectively. The network was
trained by minimizing the image similarity loss and the deformable vector field
(DVF) regularization loss without the supervision of ground truth DVFs. During
the inference stage, patches of local DVF were predicted by the trained
LocalGAN and fused to form a whole-image DVF. The local whole-image DVF was
subsequently combined with the GlobalGAN generated DVF to obtain final DVF. The
proposed method was evaluated using 100 fractional CBCTs from 20 abdominal
cancer patients in the experiments and 105 fractional CBCTs from a cohort of 21
different abdominal cancer patients in a holdout test. Qualitatively, the
registration results show great alignment between the deformed CBCT images and

propagation environment at such high frequencies, however, introduces
challenges throughout the whole protocol stack design, from physical layer
signal processing to application design. Therefore, it is fundamental to
develop a holistic understanding of the channel propagation and fading
characteristics over realistic deployment scenarios and ultra-wide bands. In
this paper, we conduct an extensive measurement campaign to evaluate the impact
of weather conditions on a wireless link in the 130-150 GHz band through a
channel sounding campaign with clear weather, rain, and snow in a typical urban
backhaul scenario. We present a novel channel sounder design that captures
signals with -82 dBm sensitivity and 20 GHz of bandwidth. We analyze link
budget, capacity, as well as channel parameters such as the delay spread and
the K-factor. Our experimental results indicate that in the considered context
the adverse weather does not interrupt the link, but introduces some additional
constraints (e.g., high delay spread and increase in path loss in snow
conditions) that need to be accounted for in the design of reliable Sixth

Although numerous deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in many

remains challenging, due to the varying sizes of abdominal organs and the
ambiguous boundaries among them. In this paper, we propose a boundary-aware
network (BA-Net) to segment abdominal organs on CT scans and MRI scans. This
model contains a shared encoder, a boundary decoder, and a segmentation
decoder. The multi-scale deep supervision strategy is adopted on both decoders,
which can alleviate the issues caused by variable organ sizes. The boundary
probability maps produced by the boundary decoder at each scale are used as
attention to enhance the segmentation feature maps. We evaluated the BA-Net on
the Abdominal Multi-Organ Segmentation (AMOS) Challenge dataset and achieved an
average Dice score of 89.29$\%$ for multi-organ segmentation on CT scans and an
average Dice score of 71.92$\%$ on MRI scans. The results demonstrate that
BA-Net is superior to nnUNet on both segmentation tasks.

  Background: Immersive technologies for education have been used for some
years. Despite this, there are few works that aim to support the development
and use of virtual environments for immersive learning.
  Research Questions: This systematic review has the following main research
question: What is the state of the art of immersive learning frameworks? In
order to answer this question, secondary research questions were defined: 1)
what definitions of immersive learning were adopted in primary studies? 2) what
are the purposes of use by the frameworks? 3) what are the elements that
compose the frameworks? 4) what are the methods used to validate the
frameworks?
  Methodology: As per the systematic review guidelines, this study followed a
rigorous and replicable process for collecting and analyzing data. From 1721
articles identified in the search engines, 15 were selected after the inclusion
and exclusion criteria.
  Findings: Most frameworks are models that investigate the causal relationship
between immersive learning factors that influence learning outcomes. Although
this theoretical aspect is important for the advancement of research, the area
still lacks more practical frameworks that address more technical details and
support development, as well as the use of immersive virtual environments by

focuses on configuring the simulation to accurately reflect real market

superior to the original Expectation-Maximisation parameter estimation in terms
of the distance between historical and simulated stylised facts. With the same
underlying model, the proposed methodology is capable of generating realistic

visual displays through each of the two filters. The measured RG and YB colour
thresholds were then compared with similar measurements made without coloured
filters in front of the eye. The blue-blocking filter absorbs only a small
amount of short-wavelength light whilst the orange filter attenuates
preferentially more short wavelength and some middle-wavelength light. The
results show that the blue-blocking filter does not affect significantly either

However, comparable or even identical performance may be realized by different

detection of cardiac arrhythmias is of great importance, computerized and
automated classification and identification of these abnormal heart signals
have received much attention for the past decades. Methods: This paper
introduces a light deep learning approach for high accuracy detection of 8
different cardiac arrhythmias and normal rhythm. To leverage deep learning
method, resampling and baseline wander removal techniques are applied to ECG
signals. In this study, 500 sample ECG segments were used as model inputs. The
rhythm classification was done by an 11-layer network in an end-to-end manner

to Schwarzschild metric. We calculate gravitational redshift, geodetic
precession, Shapiro time delay, precession of Mercury and S2 star's orbits.
Using the results of experiments and observations, we obtain the lower bounds
for the EUP fundamental length scale $L_{*}$. We obtain the smallest bound
$L_{*} \sim9\times 10^{-2}$m for gravitational redshift, and the largest bound
$L_{*} \sim4\times 10^{10}$m for the precession of S2's orbit.

  error in mathematical notation in the ""definition (iii)"" section. This
  preprint is currently under review and still subject to changes",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Research on perception without awareness primarily relies on the dissociation
paradigm, which compares a measure of awareness of a critical stimulus (direct
measures) with a measure indicating that the stimulus has been processed at all
(indirect measure). We argue that dissociations between direct and indirect
measures can only be demonstrated with respect to the critical stimulus feature
that generates the indirect effect, and the observer's awareness of that
feature, the critical cue. We expand Kahneman's (1968) concept of criterion
content to comprise the set of all cues than an observer actually uses to
perform the direct task. Different direct measures can then be compared by
studying the overlap of their criterion contents and their containment of the
critical cue. Because objective and subjective measures may integrate different
sets of cues, one measure generally cannot replace the other without
sacrificing important information. Using a simple mathematical formalization,
we redefine and clarify the concepts of validity, exclusiveness, and
exhaustiveness in the dissociation paradigm, show how dissociations among
different awareness measures falsify simple theories of consciousness, and
formulate the demand that theories of visual awareness should be sufficiently
specific to explain dissociations among different facets of awareness.

  Legal, Technical, and Policy",,,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Today's large-scale algorithmic and automated deployment of decision-making
systems threatens to exclude marginalized communities. Thus, the emergent
danger comes from the effectiveness and the propensity of such systems to
replicate, reinforce, or amplify harmful existing discriminatory acts.
Algorithmic bias exposes a deeply entrenched encoding of a range of unwanted
biases that can have profound real-world effects that manifest in domains from
employment, to housing, to healthcare. The last decade of research and examples
on these effects further underscores the need to examine any claim of a
value-neutral technology. This work examines the intersection of algorithmic
bias in consumer mobile health technologies (mHealth). We include mHealth, a
term used to describe mobile technology and associated sensors to provide
healthcare solutions through patient journeys. We also include mental and
behavioral health (mental and physiological) as part of our study. Furthermore,
we explore to what extent current mechanisms - legal, technical, and or
normative - help mitigate potential risks associated with unwanted bias in
intelligent systems that make up the mHealth domain. We provide additional
guidance on the role and responsibilities technologists and policymakers have
to ensure that such systems empower patients equitably.

businesses, and governments. The general objective of real estate price
prediction is to identify and exploit socioeconomic patterns arising from real
estate transactions over multiple aspects, ranging from the property itself to
other contributing factors. However, price prediction is a challenging
multidimensional problem that involves estimating many characteristics beyond
the property itself. In this paper, we use multiple sources of data to evaluate
the economic contribution of different socioeconomic characteristics such as
surrounding amenities, traffic conditions and social emotions. Our experiments
were conducted on 28,550 houses in Beijing, China and we rank each
characteristic by its importance. Since the use of multi-source information
improves the accuracy of predictions, the aforementioned characteristics can be
an invaluable resource to assess the economic and social value of real estate.

  Vaccination Rates",,,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous countries worldwide sought to
mobilize vaccination campaigns in an attempt to curb the spread and number of
deaths caused by the virus. One avenue in which information regarding COVID
vaccinations is propagated is that of scientific articles, which provide a
certain level of credibility regarding this. Hence, this increases the
probability that people who view these articles would get vaccinated if the
articles convey a positive message on vaccinations and conversely decreases the
probability of vaccinations if the articles convey a negative message. This
being said, this study aims to investigate the correlation between article
sentiments and the corresponding increase or decrease in vaccinations in the
United States. To do this, a lexicon-based sentiment analysis was performed in
two steps: first, article content was scraped via a Python library called
BeautifulSoup, and second, VADER was used to obtain the sentiment analysis
scores for each article based on the scraped text content. Results suggest that
there was a relatively weak correlation between the average sentiment score of
articles and the corresponding increase or decrease in COVID vaccination rates
in the US.

Web-based chatbots and personalized recommendation. Conversations containing
rich personal knowledge can be regarded as a main source to populate the PKB.
Given a user, a user attribute, and user utterances from a conversational
system, we aim to predict the personal attribute value for the user, which is
helpful for the enrichment of PKBs. However, there are three issues existing in
previous studies: (1) manually labeled utterances are required for model
training; (2) personal attribute knowledge embedded in both utterances and
external resources is underutilized; (3) the performance on predicting some
difficult personal attributes is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a
framework DSCGN based on the pre-trained language model with a noise-robust
loss function to predict personal attributes from conversations without
requiring any labeled utterances. We yield two categories of supervision, i.e.,
document-level supervision via a distant supervision strategy and
contextualized word-level supervision via a label guessing method, by mining
the personal attribute knowledge embedded in both unlabeled utterances and
external resources to fine-tune the language model. Extensive experiments over
two real-world data sets (i.e., a profession data set and a hobby data set)
show our framework obtains the best performance compared with all the twelve
baselines in terms of nDCG and MRR.

discovery the soliton mapping between two function spaces, where one is the
fractional-order index space $\{\epsilon|\epsilon\in (0, 1)\}$ in the
fractional integrable nonlinear wave equations while another denotes the
solitonic solution function space. To be specific, the fractional nonlinear
Schr\""{o}dinger (fNLS), fractional Korteweg-de Vries (fKdV), fractional
modified Korteweg-de Vries (fmKdV) and fractional sine-Gordon (fsineG)
equations proposed recently are studied in this paper. We present the train and
evaluate progress by recording the train and test loss. To illustrate the
accuracies, the data-driven solitons are also compared to the exact solutions.
Moreover, we consider the influences of several critical factors (e.g.,
activation functions containing Relu$(x)$, Sigmoid$(x)$, Swish$(x)$ and
$x\tanh(x)$, depths of fully connected layer) on the performance of the FNO
algorithm. We also use a new activation function, namely, $x\tanh(x)$, which is
not used in the field of deep learning. The results obtained in this paper may
be useful to further understand the neural networks in the fractional
integrable nonlinear wave systems and the mappings between two spaces.
