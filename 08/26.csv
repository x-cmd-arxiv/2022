to overestimate fluctuations. In addition, we find that as the rapidity

spectral models are considered to explain the multi-epoch X-ray variability of

multiple partially-covering absorbers combined with the warm corona model, and
a hybrid model. In the first model, the X-ray variability of UGC 11763 is
caused by the emission from a compact coronal region with a variable size. The
resulting disc reflection component changes accordingly. A warm absorption
model with a modest column density is required in this model too. In the
partially-covering absorption scenario, the X-ray variability of UGC 11763 is
caused by the variable covering factors of two absorbers located within a
region of $r<\approx100r_{\rm g}$. Moreover, the temperature and strength of
the warm corona have to change significantly too to explain the variable
underlying soft X-ray emission. Lastly, we investigate the possibility of
variable intrinsic power-law emission from the hot corona combined with
variable absorption in UGC 11763 without changing the geometry of the corona in
the third model. This hybrid model provides a slightly better fit than the
partially-covering absorption model with improvements in fitting the iron

called virtual decomposition control (VDC) to control the orientation and
position of the end-effector of a 7 degrees of freedom (DoF) right-hand

13n adaptation gains along with 26n upper and lower parameter bounds, where n
is the number of rigid bodies. Therefore, utilizing the VDC scheme to control
high DoF robots like the 7-DoF upper-limb exoskeleton can be an arduous task.
In this paper, a new adaptation function, so-called natural adaptation law
(NAL), is employed to eliminate these burdens from VDC, which results in
reducing all 13n gains to one and removing dependency on upper and lower
bounds. In doing so, VDC-based dynamic equations are restructured, and inertial
parameter vectors are made compatible with NAL. Then, the NAL adaptation
function is exploited to design a new adaptive VDC scheme. This novel adaptive
VDC approach ensures physical consistency conditions for estimated parameters
with no need for upper and lower bounds. Finally, the asymptotic stability of
the algorithm is proved with the virtual stability concept and the accompanying
function. The experimental results are utilized to demonstrate the excellent
performance of the proposed new adaptive VDC scheme.

some delicate aspects related to the definition of Morse index when allowing

dissertation, we study free boundary minimal surfaces with bounded Morse index
in a three-dimensional ambient manifold. More specifically, we present a
degeneration analysis of a sequence of such surfaces, proving that (up to
subsequence) they converge smoothly away from finitely many points and that,
around such `bad' points, we can at least `uniformly' control the topology and
the area of the surfaces in question. As a corollary, we obtain a complete
picture of the way different `complexity criteria' (in particular: topology,
area and Morse index) compare for free boundary minimal surfaces in ambient
manifolds with positive scalar curvature and mean convex boundary. In the
second part, we focus on an equivariant min-max scheme to prove the existence
of free boundary minimal surfaces with a prescribed topological type. The
principle is to choose a suitable group of isometries of the ambient manifold
in order to obtain exactly the topology we are looking for. We recall a proof
of the equivariant min-max theorem, and we also prove a bound on the Morse
index of the resulting surfaces. Finally, we apply this procedure to show the
existence of a new family of free boundary minimal surfaces with connected
boundary and arbitrary genus in the three-dimensional unit ball.

points arises in many applications in scientific computing, e.g., in
computational Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for science and engineering. In
these applications, the target function may represent a desired quantity of
interest of a parameterized Partial Differential Equation (PDE). Due to the
large cost of solving such problems, where each sample is computed by solving a
PDE, sample efficiency is a key concerning these applications. Recently, there
has been increasing focus on the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Deep
Learning (DL) for learning such functions from data. In this work, we propose
an adaptive sampling strategy, CAS4DL (Christoffel Adaptive Sampling for Deep
Learning) to increase the sample efficiency of DL for multivariate function
approximation. Our novel approach is based on interpreting the second to last
layer of a DNN as a dictionary of functions defined by the nodes on that layer.
With this viewpoint, we then define an adaptive sampling strategy motivated by
adaptive sampling schemes recently proposed for linear approximation schemes,
wherein samples are drawn randomly with respect to the Christoffel function of
the subspace spanned by this dictionary. We present numerical experiments
comparing CAS4DL with standard Monte Carlo (MC) sampling. Our results
demonstrate that CAS4DL often yields substantial savings in the number of
samples required to achieve a given accuracy, particularly in the case of
smooth activation functions, and it shows a better stability in comparison to
MC. These results therefore are a promising step towards fully adapting DL
towards scientific computing applications.

game? We consider the integer feasibility problem, a challenge of deciding
whether a system of linear equations and inequalities has a solution with
integer values. This is a famous NP-complete problem with applications in many
areas of Mathematics and Computer Science. Our paper describes a novel
algebraic reinforcement learning framework that allows an agent to play a game
equivalent to the integer feasibility problem. We explain how to transform the
integer feasibility problem into a game over a set of arrays with fixed margin
sums. The game starts with an initial state (an array), and by applying a legal
move that leaves the margins unchanged, we aim to eventually reach a winning
state with zeros in specific positions. To win the game the player must find a
path between the initial state and a final terminal winning state if one
exists. Finding such a winning state is equivalent to solving the integer
feasibility problem. The key algebraic ingredient is a Gr\""obner basis of the
toric ideal for the underlying axial transportation polyhedron. The Gr\""obner
basis can be seen as a set of connecting moves (actions) of the game. We then
propose a novel RL approach that trains an agent to predict moves in continuous
space to cope with the large size of action space. The continuous move is then
projected onto the set of legal moves so that the path always leads to valid
states. As a proof of concept we demonstrate in experiments that our agent can
play well the simplest version of our game for 2-way tables. Our work
highlights the potential to train agents to solve non-trivial mathematical
queries through contemporary machine learning methods used to train agents to

be present. It has been suggested that these outlier or dropout events can be
explained by the resonant cyclotron heating process, because these ions all
have the same cyclotron frequency as He2+. We investigate the region in the
corona where these outlier events form. It must be above the ionization
freeze-in height and the transition to collisionless plasma conditions, but low
enough that the wind still feels the effects of solar gravity. We suggest that
the dropout events correspond to relatively dense blobs of gas in which the
heating is reduced because local variations in the Alfven speed change the
reflection of Alfven waves and the turbulent cascade. As a result, the wave
power at the cyclotron frequency of the fully stripped ions is absorbed by He2+
and may not be able to heat the other fully-stripped ions enough to overcome
solar gravity. If this picture is borne out, it may help to discriminate

inequalities: the Holevo bound on the quantity of information transmitted by a
quantum communication channel, and, much more generally, the monotonicity of
quantum relative entropy under trace-preserving positive linear maps --
complete positivity of the map need not be assumed. The latter result was first
proved by M\""uller-Hermes and Reeb, based on work of Beigi. For a simple
application of such monotonicities, we consider any `divergence' that is
non-increasing under quantum measurements, such as the concavity of von Neumann
entropy, or various known quantum divergences. An elegant argument due to Hiai,
Ohya, and Tsukada is used to show that the infimum of such a `divergence' on
pairs of quantum states with prescribed trace distance is the same as the
corresponding infimum on pairs of binary classical states. Applications of the
new integral formulae to the general probabilistic model of information theory,
and a related integral formula for the classical R\'enyi divergence, are also
discussed.

  ExpoCloud enables maximal possible levels of concurrency by creating compute
instances on-the-fly, saves money by terminating unneeded instances, provides a
mechanism for saving both time and money by avoiding the exploration of
parameter settings that are as hard or harder than the parameter settings whose
exploration timed out. Effective fault tolerance mechanisms make ExpoCloud
suitable for large experiments.
  ExpoCloud provides an interface that allows its use under various cloud

for wind farm planning, performance evaluation, and demonstrating the utility
of advanced control algorithms in increasing the annual energy production. In
practice, however, it remains challenging to correctly estimate the flow and
achieve significant performance gains using conventional low-fidelity models.
This is due to the over-simplified static nature of wake predictions from
models that are agnostic to the effects of atmospheric boundary layer
turbulence and the complex aerodynamic interactions among wind turbines. To
improve the predictive capability of low-fidelity models while remaining
amenable to control design, we offer a stochastic dynamical modeling framework
for capturing the effect of atmospheric turbulence on the thrust force and
power generation as determined by the actuator disk concept. In this approach,
we use stochastically forced linear models of the turbulent velocity field to
augment the analytically computed wake velocity and achieve consistency with
higher-fidelity models in capturing power and thrust force measurements. The
power-spectral densities of our stochastic models are identified via convex
optimization to ensure consistency with partially available velocity statistics
or power and thrust force measurements while preserving model parsimony. We
demonstrate the utility of our approach in capturing turbulence intensity
variations behind wind turbines and estimating thrust force and power signals
generated by large-eddy simulations of the flow over a cascade of turbines. Our
results provide insight into the significance of sparse field measurements in
recovering the statistical signature of wind farm turbulence using stochastic

magnetic and anomalous thermoelectric responses in order to capture the
topological signatures of a driven $\alpha$-$T_3$ lattice. It is revealed that
both the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment associated with the
flat band change their respective signs across $\alpha=1/\sqrt{2}$. The
off-resonant light distorts the flat band near the Dirac points when
$0<\alpha<1$ which eventually introduces two distinct well separated forbidden
gaps of equal width in the quasienergy spectrum. The orbital magnetization
varies linearly with the chemical potential, in the forbidden gaps. The slopes
of the linear regions in the orbital magnetization are closely related to the
respective Chern numbers on either side of $\alpha=1/\sqrt{2}$. We find that
the slope for $\alpha>1/\sqrt{2}$ is approximately two times of that for
$\alpha<1/\sqrt{2}$ which essentially indicates a topological phase transition
across $\alpha=1/\sqrt{2}$. However, the anomalous Nernst coefficient vanishes
when the chemical potential is tuned in the forbidden gaps. The anomalous Hall
conductivity in the forbidden gap(s) approaches different quantized values on
either side of $\alpha=1/\sqrt{2}$. All these topological signatures can be
observed experimentally.

Fe3+-, Al3+-, or (Al3+, Fe3+)-alloying increases the transition pressure, while
Fe2+-alloying has the opposite effect; b) in the absence of coexisting phases,
the pressure-depth range of the Pv-PPv transition seems quite broad to cause a
sharp D"" discontinuity (< 30 km); c) the average Clapeyron slope of the
two-phase regions are consistent with previous measurements, calculations in
MgSiO3, and inferences from seismic data. In addition, d) we observe a

examine the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a constraint-based
relational causal discovery algorithm is sound and complete for cyclic
relational causal models. We introduce relational acyclification, an operation
specifically designed for relational models that enables reasoning about the
identifiability of cyclic relational causal models. We show that under the

remain fair with changes in the task or demographic distribution. To ensure
fairness in the wild, it is important for a system to adapt to such changes as
it accesses new data in an incremental fashion. In this work, we propose to
address this issue by introducing the problem of learning fair representations
in an incremental learning setting. To this end, we present Fairness-aware
Incremental Representation Learning (FaIRL), a representation learning system
that can sustain fairness while incrementally learning new tasks. FaIRL is able
to achieve fairness and learn new tasks by controlling the rate-distortion
function of the learned representations. Our empirical evaluations show that
FaIRL is able to make fair decisions while achieving high performance on the
target task, outperforming several baselines.

parabolic-elliptic pdes at any given time $T>0$. More precisely, we consider
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky--Korteweg-de Vries equation coupled with a second
order elliptic equation posed in the interval $(0,1)$. We first show that the
linearized system is globally null-controllable by means of a localized
interior control acting on either the KS-KdV or the elliptic equation. Using
the Carleman approach we provide the existence of a control with the explicit
cost $Ke^{K/T}$ with some constant $K>0$ independent in $T$. Then, applying the
source term method and the Banach fixed point argument, we conclude the
small-time local null-controllability result of the nonlinear systems.
  Besides, we also established a uniform null-controllability result for an
asymptotic two-parabolic system (fourth and second order) that converges to the
concerned parabolic-elliptic model when the control is acting on the second
order pde.

evaluation costs are commonly seen in the real world. Such problems are now
known as multi-objective optimization problems with heterogeneous objectives

HE-MOPs, and most of them focus on bi-objective problems with one fast

develop a multi-objective Bayesian evolutionary optimization approach to
HE-MOPs by exploiting the different data sets on the cheap and expensive
objectives in HE-MOPs to alleviate the search bias caused by the heterogeneous
evaluation costs for evaluating different objectives. To make the best use of
two different training data sets, one with solutions evaluated on all
objectives and the other with those only evaluated on the fast objectives, two
separate Gaussian process models are constructed. In addition, a new
acquisition function that mitigates search bias towards the fast objectives is
suggested, thereby achieving a balance between convergence and diversity. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by testing it on widely

solve optimally even when simplifying assumptions are adopted, e.g. planar
graphs (typically -- grids), discretized time, uniform duration of move and
wait actions etc. On the other hand, MAPF under such restrictive assumptions
(also known as the Classical MAPF) is equivalent to the so-called pebble motion
problem for which non-optimal polynomial time algorithms do exist. Recently, a
body of works emerged that investigated MAPF beyond the basic setting and, in
particular, considered agents of arbitrary size and shape. Still, to the best
of our knowledge no complete algorithms for such MAPF variant exists. In this
work we attempt to narrow this gap by considering MAPF for large agents and
suggesting how this problem can be reduced to pebble motion on (general)
graphs. The crux of this reduction is the procedure that moves away the agents
away from the edge which is needed to perform a move action of the current
agent. We consider different variants of how this procedure can be implemented
and present a variant of the pebble motion algorithm which incorporates this
procedure. Unfortunately, the algorithm is still incomplete, but empirically we
show that it is able to solve much more MAPF instances (under the strict time
limit) with large agents on arbitrary non-planar graphs (roadmaps) compared to
the state-of-the-art MAPF solver -- Continous Conflict-Based Search (CCBS).

equation, a Lorentz covariant Dirac-like equation whose positive and
``negative'' frequency plane wave solutions' dispersion relations are no longer
degenerate. At the second quantization level, we show that this implies that
particles and antiparticles sharing the same wave number have different
energies and momenta. In spite of that, we prove that by properly fixing the
values of the relativistic invariants that define the asymmetric Dirac free
field Lagrangian density, we can build a consistent, fully relativistic, and
renormalizable quantum electrodynamics (QED) that is empirically equivalent to
the standard QED. We discuss the reasons and implications of this non-trivial
equivalence, exploring qualitatively other scenarios in which the asymmetric
Dirac fields may lead to beyond the standard model predictions. We conjecture
that this non-degeneracy in the energies for particles and antiparticles may
lead to a fully relativistic understanding of the asymmetry between matter and
antimatter in the present day universe as well as to an alternative way of
modeling the gravitational interaction between a particle and an antiparticle.
We give a complete account of how the asymmetric Dirac fields and the
corresponding annihilation and creation operators transform under improper
Lorentz transformations (parity and time reversal operations) and under the
charge conjugation operation. We also prove that the present theory respects
the CPT theorem.

enabling high-quality and diverse synthesis of images from a given text prompt.
However, these models lack the ability to mimic the appearance of subjects in a
given reference set and synthesize novel renditions of them in different
contexts. In this work, we present a new approach for ""personalization"" of
text-to-image diffusion models. Given as input just a few images of a subject,
we fine-tune a pretrained text-to-image model such that it learns to bind a
unique identifier with that specific subject. Once the subject is embedded in
the output domain of the model, the unique identifier can be used to synthesize
novel photorealistic images of the subject contextualized in different scenes.
By leveraging the semantic prior embedded in the model with a new autogenous
class-specific prior preservation loss, our technique enables synthesizing the
subject in diverse scenes, poses, views and lighting conditions that do not
appear in the reference images. We apply our technique to several
previously-unassailable tasks, including subject recontextualization,
text-guided view synthesis, and artistic rendering, all while preserving the
subject's key features. We also provide a new dataset and evaluation protocol
for this new task of subject-driven generation. Project page:

density can be calculated one of two ways. The line integral can be conducted
along the coil's wire, summing up the differential force contribution. For each
differential line segment, the force is obtained as a cross product with the
magnetic flux density. Alternatively, the coil's energy in the field is the
current times the flux threading the coil. Hence, the energy is obtained by
executing a surface integral over the coil's open surface. Here, a dot product
of the differential surface element with the magnetic flux density is executed
under the integral sign. The forces and torques can then be obtained from the
negative derivative of the energy with respect to the appropriate coordinate.
For yoke-based Kibble balances, the latter method is much simpler since most of
the flux is contained in the inner yoke of the magnet and can be written as a
simple equation. Here, we use this method to provide simple equations and their
results for finding the torques and forces that act on a coil in a yoke-based
magnet system. We further introduce a simple method that allows the calculation
of the position and orientation difference between the coil and the magnet from
three measurements.

presents Grasp'D, an approach for grasp synthesis with a differentiable contact

gradient-based methods as an alternative to sampling-based grasp synthesis,
which fails without simplifying assumptions, such as pre-specified contact
locations and eigengrasps. Such assumptions limit grasp discovery and, in
particular, exclude high-contact power grasps. In contrast, our
simulation-based approach allows for stable, efficient, physically realistic,
high-contact grasp synthesis, even for gripper morphologies with high-degrees
of freedom. We identify and address challenges in making grasp simulation
amenable to gradient-based optimization, such as non-smooth object surface
geometry, contact sparsity, and a rugged optimization landscape. Grasp'D
compares favorably to analytic grasp synthesis on human and robotic hand
models, and resultant grasps achieve over 4x denser contact, leading to
significantly higher grasp stability. Video and code available at

  Deep Learning","Paper published at SENSORS 2022 Conference",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The Global Positioning System (GPS) has become a part of our daily life with
the primary goal of providing geopositioning service. For an unmanned aerial
system (UAS), geolocalization ability is an extremely important necessity which
is achieved using Inertial Navigation System (INS) with the GPS at its heart.
Without geopositioning service, UAS is unable to fly to its destination or come
back home. Unfortunately, GPS signals can be jammed and suffer from a multipath
problem in urban canyons. Our goal is to propose an alternative approach to
geolocalize a UAS when GPS signal is degraded or denied. Considering UAS has a
downward-looking camera on its platform that can acquire real-time images as
the platform flies, we apply modern deep learning techniques to achieve
geolocalization. In particular, we perform image matching to establish latent
feature conjugates between UAS acquired imagery and satellite orthophotos. A
typical application of feature matching suffers from high-rise buildings and
new constructions in the field that introduce uncertainties into homography
estimation, hence results in poor geolocalization performance. Instead, we
extract GIS information from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to semantically segment
matched features into building and terrain classes. The GIS mask works as a
filter in selecting semantically matched features that enhance coplanarity

  Robust Safe Control For Dynamic Systems with Relative Degree Two Safety
  Indices",,,,,"math.OC cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this draft article, we consider the problem of achieving safe control of a
dynamic system for which the safety index or (control barrier function
(loosely)) has relative degree equal to two. We consider parameter affine
nonlinear dynamic systems and assume that the parametric uncertainty is uniform
and known a-priori or being updated online through an estimator/parameter
adaptation law. Under this uncertainty, the usual CBF-QP safe control approach
takes the form of a robust optimization problem. Both the right hand side and
left hand side of the inequality constraints depend on the unknown parameter.
With the given representation of uncertainty, the CBF-QP safe control ends up
being a convex semi-infinite problem. Using two different philosophies, one
based on weak duality and another based on the Lossless s-procedure, we arrive
at identical SDP formulations of this robust CBF-QP problem. Thus we show that
the problem of computing safe controls with known parametric uncertainty can be
posed as a tractable convex problem and be solved online. (This is work in
progress).

optimizing the pixel reconstruction loss on masked inputs, we minimize the
distance between the intermediate feature map of the teacher model and that of
the student model. This design leads to a computationally efficient knowledge
distillation framework, given 1) only a small visible subset of patches is
used, and 2) the (cumbersome) teacher model only needs to be partially
executed, ie, forward propagate inputs through the first few layers, for
obtaining intermediate feature maps. Compared to directly distilling fine-tuned
models, distilling pre-trained models substantially improves downstream
performance. For example, by distilling the knowledge from an MAE pre-trained
ViT-L into a ViT-B, our method achieves 84.0% ImageNet top-1 accuracy,
outperforming the baseline of directly distilling a fine-tuned ViT-L by 1.2%.
More intriguingly, our method can robustly distill knowledge from teacher
models even with extremely high masking ratios: e.g., with 95% masking ratio
where merely TEN patches are visible during distillation, our ViT-B
competitively attains a top-1 ImageNet accuracy of 83.6%; surprisingly, it can
still secure 82.4% top-1 ImageNet accuracy by aggressively training with just

transition of a 1+1D gapless system. Such novel boundary phenomena can occur at
phase transitions between distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases,
whose protected edge modes are incompatible and compete at criticality. We
consider a minimal symmetry class $\mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$ which
protects two non-trivial SPT phases in 1+1D. Tuning between these, we find a
critical point with central charge $c=8/5$ and two stable boundary phases

Subsequently tuning a single boundary parameter leads to a direct continuous

which exacerbates the issue of training ST models for 3D tasks. In this work,
we propose two contributions to improve ST models on point clouds. First, we
contribute a new ST-based point cloud network, by using Progressive Point Patch
Embedding as the tokenizer and Feature Propagation with global representation
appending as the decoder. Our network is shown to be less hungry for data, and
enables ST to achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art. Second,
we formulate a simple yet effective pipeline dubbed \textit{Pix4Point}, which
allows harnessing Transformers pretrained in the image domain to enhance
downstream point cloud understanding. This is achieved through a
modality-agnostic ST backbone with the help of our proposed tokenizer and

practice to script scenario tests validating the system's compliance with a

the type of end-user activity to which the system is required to respond in a
live instance. It is especially true as compliance might also break in
scenarios of interactions with external events or processes, such as other
users. State-of-the-art approaches aim at inducing the software into runtime
errors by generating tests that maximize some target metrics, such as code
coverage. As a result, they suffer from targeting an infinitely large search
space, are severely limited in recognizing error states that do not result in
runtime errors, and the test cases they generate are often challenging to
interpret. Other forms of testing, such as Record-Replay, instead fail to
capture the end-users' decision-making process, hence producing largely
scripted test scenarios. Therefore, it is impossible to test a software's
compliance with unknown but otherwise plausible states. This paper introduces
""Synthetic End-User Testing,"" a novel testing strategy for complex systems in
which real-world users are synthesized into reusable agents and employed to
test and validate the software in a simulation environment. Hence, it discusses
how end-user behavioral examples can be obtained and used to create agents that
operate the target software in a reduced search space of likely action

learned compliance of the system, is also introduced. Finally, a prototype

complementary to vision-language contrastive focusing on text-related
representation. Second, masked self-distillation is also consistent with
vision-language contrastive from the perspective of training objective as both
utilize the visual encoder for feature aligning, and thus is able to learn
local semantics getting indirect supervision from the language. We provide
specially designed experiments with a comprehensive analysis to validate the
two benefits. Symmetrically, we also introduce the local semantic supervision
into the text branch, which further improves the pretraining performance. With

between the integrated-Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect and gravitational lensing can
significantly bias primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) searches, recent work by
Hill (2018) has suggested that other combinations of secondary anisotropies can
also produce significant biases. Building on that work, we use the WebSky and
Sehgal et al.(2010) simulations to perform an extensive examination of possible
biases to PNG measurements for the local, equilateral and orthogonal shapes.
For a Planck-like CMB experiment, without foreground cleaning, we find
significant biases from cosmic infrared background (CIB)-lensing and thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ)-lensing bispectra for the local and orthogonal
templates, and from CIB and tSZ bispectra for the equilateral template. For
future experiments, such as the Simons Observatory, biases from correlations
between the ISW effect and the tSZ and CIB will also become important. Finally
we investigate whether foreground-cleaning techniques are able to suppress
these biases sufficiently. We find that the majority of these biases are
effectively suppressed by the internal-linear-combination method and the total
bias to Planck-like and SO-like experiments is less than the $1\,\sigma$
statistical error. However, the small total bias arises from the cancellation
of several $1\,\sigma$ biases for Planck-like experiments and $2\,\sigma$
biases for SO-like. As this cancellation is likely sensitive to the precise
modelling, to ensure robustness against these biases explicit removal methods
should be used, likely at the cost of decreased constraining power.

nonstandard gravity. The latter claim is realized for holographically-defined
continuum models. We demonstrate this by computing the deviations from standard
gravity in a specific 5D scalar-gravity system that gives rise to a gapped
continuum (i.e the linear dilaton background). We find an $R^{-2}$ deviation
from the Newtonian potential. At finite temperature we find an energy density
with matter-like behavior in the brane Friedmann equation, holographically
induced from the bulk geometry. Thus, remarkably, a brane-world living in the
linear dilaton background automatically contains dark matter. We also present a
slightly more evolved asymptotically-AdS linear dilaton model, for which the
deviations exhibit a transition between AdS and linear dilaton behaviors.

bright stars and has found thousands of planet candidates. However, mainly
because of the low spatial resolution of its cameras ($\approx$ 21
arcsec/pixel), TESS is expected to detect several false positives (FPs); hence,
vetting needs to be done. Here, we present a follow-up program of TESS
candidates orbiting solar-analogue stars that are in the all-sky PLATO input
catalogue. Using Gaia photometry and astrometry we built an absolute
colour-magnitude diagram and isolated solar-analogue candidates' hosts. We
performed a probabilistic validation of each candidate using the VESPA software
and produced a prioritized list of objects that have the highest probability of
being genuine transiting planets. Following this procedure, we eliminated the
majority of FPs and statistically vetted 23 candidates. For this remaining set,
we performed a stellar neighbourhood analysis using Gaia Early Data Release 3
and centroid motion tests, greatly enhancing the on-target probability of 12 of
them. We then used publicly available high-resolution imaging data to confirm
their transit source and found five new, fully validated planets. For the
remaining candidates, we propose on-off photometry to further refine the list
of genuine candidates and prepare for the subsequent radial velocity follow-up.

interest from the astronomical community because it can be efficiently applied
to Cherenkov telescope arrays. Aims: We have investigated the accuracy that can
be achieved in reconstructing stellar sizes by fitting the visibility curve
measured on the ground. The large number of expected available astronomical
targets, the limited number of nights in a year, and the likely presence of
multiple baselines will require careful planning of the observational strategy
to maximise the scientific output. Methods: We studied the trend of the error
on the estimated angular size, considering the uniform disk model, by varying
several parameters related to the observations, such as the total number of
measurements, the integration time, the signal-to-noise ratio, and different
positions along the baseline. Results: We found that measuring the value of the
zero-baseline correlation is essential to obtain the best possible results.
Systems that can measure this value directly or for which it is known in
advance will have better sensitivity. We also found that to minimise the
integration time, it is sufficient to obtain a second measurement at a baseline
half-way between 0 and that corresponding to the first zero of the visibility
function. This function does not have to be measured at multiple positions.
Finally, we obtained some analytical expressions that can be used under
specific conditions to determine the accuracy that can be achieved in
reconstructing the angular size of a star in advance. This is useful to
optimise the observation schedule.

  https://armastuschen.github.io/projects/NPP_Net/",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Near-Periodic Patterns (NPP) are ubiquitous in man-made scenes and are
composed of tiled motifs with appearance differences caused by lighting,
defects, or design elements. A good NPP representation is useful for many
applications including image completion, segmentation, and geometric remapping.
But representing NPP is challenging because it needs to maintain global
consistency (tiled motifs layout) while preserving local variations (appearance
differences). Methods trained on general scenes using a large dataset or
single-image optimization struggle to satisfy these constraints, while methods
that explicitly model periodicity are not robust to periodicity detection
errors. To address these challenges, we learn a neural implicit representation
using a coordinate-based MLP with single image optimization. We design an input
feature warping module and a periodicity-guided patch loss to handle both
global consistency and local variations. To further improve the robustness, we
introduce a periodicity proposal module to search and use multiple candidate
periodicities in our pipeline. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on more than 500 images of building facades, friezes, wallpapers, ground, and
Mondrian patterns on single and multi-planar scenes.

the survival dynamics of a prey swarm while chased by a predator. With the
varying mass of the prey and predator, diverse escape patterns emerge, such as
circling, chasing, maneuvering, dividing into subgroups, and merging into a
unitary group, similar to the escape trajectories observed in nature. Moreover,
we find a transition from non-survival to survival of the prey swarm with
increasing predator mass. The transition regime is also sensitive to the
variation in prey mass. Further, the analysis of the prey group survival as a
function of predator-to-prey mass ratio unveils the existence of three distinct
regimes: (i) frequent chase and capture leading to the non-survival of the prey
swarm, (ii) an intermediate regime where competition between pursuit and
capture occurs, resembling an arms race, and (iii) the survival regime without
the capture of prey. Interestingly, our study demonstrates the existence of a
favourable predator-prey mass ratio for efficient predation, which corroborates

parallel-transported basis bears a close relationship to the singular-value

series expansions are effected through the projection operator, whose expansion
does not involve energy denominators or any type of singularity, and in terms
of which both the singular-value basis and the parallel-transported basis can
be expressed. The parallel-transported basis is a version of Poincar\'e gauge,
well known in electromagnetism, which provides a relationship between the

solitosynthesis, phase transitions can still form solitons from particles left

image formation, it is well-known that data collected over a wide azimuthal
angle violate the isotropic scattering property typically assumed. Many
techniques have been proposed to account for this issue, including both
full-aperture and sub-aperture methods based on filtering, regularized least
squares, and Bayesian methods. A full-aperture method that uses a hierarchical
Bayesian prior to incorporate appropriate speckle modeling and reduction was
recently introduced to produce samples of the posterior density rather than a
single image estimate. This uncertainty quantification information is more
robust as it can generate a variety of statistics for the scene. As proposed,
the method was not well-suited for large problems, however, as the sampling was
inefficient. Moreover, the method was not explicitly designed to mitigate the
effects of the faulty isotropic scattering assumption. In this work we
therefore propose a new sub-aperture SAR imaging method that uses a sparse
Bayesian learning-type algorithm to more efficiently produce approximate
posterior densities for each sub-aperture window. These estimates may be useful
in and of themselves, or when of interest, the statistics from these
distributions can be combined to form a composite image. Furthermore, unlike
the often-employed lp-regularized least squares methods, no user-defined
parameters are required. Application-specific adjustments are made to reduce
the typically burdensome runtime and storage requirements so that appropriately
large images can be generated. Finally, this paper focuses on incorporating
these techniques into SAR image formation process. That is, for the problem
starting with SAR phase history data, so that no additional processing errors

mass-to-light ratio ($M_*/L$) is widely used for efficient stellar mass
estimates. However, it remains unclear whether this low scatter comes from a
natural order in the galaxy population, or whether it is driven by simple
relationships in the models used to describe them. In this work we investigate
the origins of the relationship by contrasting the derived relationship from a
simple 4-parameter SED model with a more sophisticated 14-dimensional
Prospector-$\alpha$ model including nonparametric star formation histories
(SFHs). We apply these models to 63,430 galaxies at $0.5<z<3$ and fit a
hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) to the population distribution in the
$(g-r)$--$\log(M/L_g)$ plane. We find that Prospector-$\alpha$ infers
systematically higher $M_*/L$ by 0.12 dex, a result of nonparametric SFHs
producing older ages, and also systematically redder rest-frame $(g-r)$ by 0.06
mag owing to the contribution from nebular emission. Surprisingly, the combined
effects of the $M_*/L$ and $(g-r)$ offsets produce a similar average
relationship for the two models, though Prospector-$\alpha$ produces a higher
scatter of 0.28 dex compared to the simple model of 0.12 dex. Also, unlike the
simple model, the Prospector-$\alpha$ relationship shows substantial redshift
evolution due to stellar aging. These expected and testable effects produce
overall older and redder galaxies, though the color--$M_*/L$ relationship is
measured only at $0.5<z<3$. Finally, we demonstrate that the HBM produces
substantial shrinkage in the individual posteriors of faint galaxies, an
important first step toward using the observed galaxy population directly to
inform the SED fitting priors.

numerical simulations of convective envelopes of solar-type stars. These
profiles are characterized by a slow equator and fast poles (i.e., reversed
with respect to the Sun) and have been found in simulations for high Rossby
numbers (slow rotators). Rotation profiles like this have been reported
observationally in evolved stars, but have never been unambiguously observed
for cool solar-type stars on the main sequence. In this context, detecting this
regime in main-sequence solar-type stars would improve our understanding of
their magnetorotational evolution. The goal of this study is to identify the
most promising cool main-sequence stellar candidates for anti-solar
differential rotation in the \textit{Kepler} sample. First, we introduce a new
theoretical formula to estimate fluid Rossby numbers, $Ro_{\rm f}$, of
main-sequence solar-type stars, from observational quantities, and taking the
influences of the internal structure and metallicity into account. We obtain a
list of the most promising stars that are likely to show anti-solar
differential rotation. We identify two samples: one at solar metallicity,
including 14 targets, and another for other metallicities, including 8 targets.
We find that the targets with the highest $Ro_{\rm f}$ are likely to be early-G
or late-F stars at about log$_{10}g=4.37$~dex. We conclude that cool
main-sequence stellar candidates for anti-solar differential rotation exist in
the \textit{Kepler} sample. The most promising candidate is KIC~10907436, and
two other particularly interesting candidates are the solar analog KIC~7189915
and the seismic target KIC~12117868. Future characterization of these 22 stars
is expected to help us understand how dynamics can impact magnetic and
rotational evolution of old solar-type stars at high Rossby number.

an investigation involving the thermodynamics of coupled channels has not been

thermodynamic scenario associated with mechanoelectrical transduction channels
as a single and coupling of two-state channels. The modeling was inspired by
the Tsallis theory, in which we derived the open and closed probability
distributions, the joint probability distribution, the Tsallis entropy, and the
Shannon mutual information. Despite being well studied in many biological
systems, the literature has not addressed both entropy and mutual information
related to isolated and a pair of physically interacting mechanoelectrical
transduction channels. Inspired by the hair cell biophysics, we revealed how
the presence of nonextensivity modulates the degree of entropy and mutual
information as a function of stereocilia displacements. In this sense, we
showed how the non-extensivity regulates the current versus displacement curve
for a single and two interacting channels made up of a single open and closed
states. Overall, subadditivity and superadditivity yielded increments and
decrements in the entropy and mutual information compared with the extensive
regime. We also observed that the magnitude of the interaction between the two
channels significantly influences the amplitude of the joint entropy and the
mutual information. These results are directly related to the modulation of the
channel kinetics, given by changes evoked by hair cell displacements. Finally,
we found that the gating force modulates the contribution of subadditivity and

present findings shed light on the thermodynamic process involved in the

optimize metrics that are imperfectly aligned with the best-interest of users
but are easy to measure, like ad-clicks and user engagement. This has resulted
in a host of hard-to-measure side-effects: political polarization, addiction,
fake news. RS design faces a recommender alignment problem: that of aligning
recommendations with the goals of users, system designers, and society as a
whole. But how do we test and compare potential solutions to align RS? Their
massive scale makes them costly and risky to test in deployment. We synthesized
a simple abstract modelling framework to guide future work.
  To illustrate it, we construct a toy experiment where we ask: ""How can we
evaluate the consequences of using user retention as a reward function?"" To
answer the question, we learn recommender policies that optimize reward
functions by controlling graph dynamics on a toy environment. Based on the
effects that trained recommenders have on their environment, we conclude that
engagement maximizers generally lead to worse outcomes than aligned
recommenders but not always. After learning, we examine competition between RS
as a potential solution to RS alignment. We find that it generally makes our
toy-society better-off than it would be under the absence of recommendation or
engagement maximizers.
  In this work, we aimed for a broad scope, touching superficially on many
different points to shed light on how an end-to-end study of reward functions
for recommender systems might be done. Recommender alignment is a pressing and
important problem. Attempted solutions are sure to have far-reaching impacts.
Here, we take a first step in developing methods to evaluating and comparing
solutions with respect to their impacts on society.

decision theory (SDT), which relates information uptake in animals to Bayesian
inference. SDT effectively explains many learning tasks in animals, but
extending this theory to predict how animals will learn in changing
environments still poses a challenge for ecologists. We addressed this
shortcoming with a novel implementation of Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampling to simulate how animals sample environmental information and
learn as a result. We applied our framework to an individual-based model
simulating complex foraging tasks encountered by wild animals. Simulated
``animals"" learned behavioral strategies that optimized foraging returns simply
by following the principles of an MCMC sampler. In these simulations,
behavioral plasticity was most conducive to efficient foraging in unpredictable
and uncertain environments. Our model suggests that animals prioritize highly
concentrated resources even when these resources are less available overall, in
line with existing knowledge on optimal foraging and ideal free distribution
theory. Our innovative computational modelling framework can be applied more
widely to simulate the learning of many other tasks in animals and humans.

from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) archive toward the
high-mass star formation region IRAS 16076-5134. We identify fourteen dense
cores with masses between 0.3 to 22 M$_{\odot}$. We find an ensemble of
filament-like CO (3-2) ejections from -62 to +83 km s$^{-1}$ that appear to
arise radially from a common central position, close to the dense core MM8. The
ensemble of filaments, has a quasi-isotropic distribution in the plane of the
sky. The radial velocity of several filaments follow a linear velocity
gradient, incresing from a common origin. Considering the whole ensemble of
filaments, we estimate its total mass to be 138 and 216 M$_{\odot}$ from its CO
emission, for 70 K and 140 K respectively. Also, assuming a constant velocity
expansion of the filaments (of 83 km s$^{-1}$) we estimate the dynamical age of
the outflowing material (3500 years), its momentum (~10$^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$ km
s$^{-1}$) and its kinetic energy (~10$^{48-49}$ erg). The morphology and
kinematics presented by the filaments suggest the presence of a dispersal
outflow with explosive characteristics in IRAS 16076-5134. In addition, we make
a raw estimate of the lower limit of the frequency rate of the explosive
dispersal outflows in the Galaxy (one every 110 years) considering constant
star formation rate and efficiency with respect to the galactocentric radius of
the Galaxy. This may imply a comparable rate of dispersal outflows and
supernovae (approximately one every 50 years), which may be important for the
energy budget of the Interstellar Medium and the link between dispersal
outflows and high-mass star formation.

they are trained on fixed content domains with certain degradations (whether

view data, and across altitudes, is currently unknown. Nonetheless, pairing
drones with proper image super-resolution is of great value. It would enable
drones to fly higher covering larger fields of view, while maintaining a high

inconsistent data that violate pre-determined integrity constraints. Data
cleaning is an extensively studied paradigm that singles out a consistent
repair of the inconsistent data. Consistent query answering (CQA) is an
alternative approach to data cleaning that asks for all tuples guaranteed to be
returned by a given query on all (in most cases, exponentially many) repairs of
the inconsistent data. This paper identifies a class of acyclic
select-project-join (SPJ) queries for which CQA can be solved via SQL rewriting
with a linear time guarantee. Our rewriting method can be viewed as a
generalization of Yannakakis's algorithm for acyclic joins to the inconsistent
setting. We present LinCQA, a system that can output rewritings in both SQL and
non-recursive Datalog rules for every query in this class. We show that LinCQA
often outperforms the existing CQA systems on both synthetic and real-world

the plasma adiabatic response. The free plasma electrons migrate so as to
neutralize the space charge field of the bunch, and the bunch is therefore
focused by the azimuthal magnetic field generated by its own current, that is
not balanced by the radial electric field. Since the length of the bunch is
much longer than the plasma electron wavelength, the bunch also undergoes the
self-modulation instability. Thus, the amplitude of the wakefields grows along
the bunch and along the plasma, and the defocusing effect of the
self-modulation can become dominant over the adiabatic focusing effect. We show
that, when seeding the self-modulation with a preceding electron bunch, the
transition between the effect of the adiabatic response and that of the

requires specific Quality of Service (QoS) and network features. Therefore,
network slicing can be a solution to fulfill the requirements of various
services. Some services, such as infotainment, may have similar requirements to
serve flying and ground-based cars. Therefore, some slices can serve both kinds
of cars. However, when network slice resource sharing is too aggressive, slices
can not meet QoS requirements, where resource under-provisioning causes the
violation of QoS, and resource over-provisioning causes resource
under-utilization. We propose two closed loops for managing RAN slice resources
for cars to address these challenges. First, we present an auction mechanism
for allocating Resource Block (RB) to the tenants who provide services to the
cars using slices. Second, we design one closed loop that maps slices and
services of tenants to virtual Open Distributed Units (vO-DUs) and assigns RB
to vO-DUs for management purposes. Third, we design another closed loop for

  We interviewed 22 people with biological experience and varied levels of

complete lattice of subsets of a (system's state) space to the two-point

Robust analyses cannot discriminate between a subset of the metric space and
its closure, therefore one can restrict to the complete lattice of closed
subsets. When the metric space is compact, the complete lattice of closed
subsets ordered by reverse inclusion is w-continuous and robust analyses are
exactly the Scott continuous maps. Thus, one can also ask whether a robust
analysis is computable (with respect to a countable base). The main result of
this paper establishes a relation between robustness and Scott continuity, when
the metric space is not compact. The key idea is to replace the metric space
with a compact Hausdorff space, and relate robustness and Scott continuity by
an adjunction between the complete lattice of closed subsets of the metric
space and the w-continuous lattice of closed subsets of the compact Hausdorff
space. We demonstrate the applicability of this result with several examples

performance improvement similar to that of the hand-tuned version. This work
presents an in-depth analysis of the discovered optimizations, revealing that
the primary sources of improvement vary across applications; that most of the
optimizations generalize across GPU architectures; and that several of the most

  Neuroanatomy in Large Sets of 3D Medical Image Volumes","PhD thesis",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The contributions of this thesis stem from technology developed to analyse
large sets of volumetric images in terms of atom-like features extracted in 3D
image space, following SIFT algorithm in 2D image space. New feature properties
are introduced including a binary feature sign, analogous to an electrical
charge, and a discrete set of symmetric feature orientation states in 3D space.
These new properties are leveraged to extend feature invariance to include the
sign inversion and parity (SP) transform, analogous to the charge conjugation
and parity (CP) transform between a particle and its antiparticle in quantum
mechanics, thereby accounting for local intensity contrast inversion between
imaging modalities and axis reflections due to shape symmetry. A novel
exponential kernel is proposed to quantify the similarity of a pair of features
extracted in different images from their properties including location, scale,
orientation, sign and appearance. A novel measure entitled the soft Jaccard is
proposed to quantify the similarity of a pair of feature sets based on their
overlap or intersection-over-union, where a kernel establishes non-binary or
soft equivalence between a pair of feature elements. The soft Jaccard may be
used to identify pairs of feature sets extracted from the same individuals or
families with high accuracy, and a simple distance threshold led to the
surprising discovery of previously unknown individual and family labeling
errors in major public neuroimage datasets. A new algorithm is proposed to
register or spatially align a pair of feature sets, entitled SIFT Coherent
Point Drift (SIFT-CPD), by identifying a transform that maximizes the soft
Jaccard between a fixed feature set and a transformed set. SIFT-CPD achieves
faster and more accurate registration than the original CPD algorithm based on
feature location information alone, in a variety of challenging.

moderate focal lengths (tens to a few hundreds of metres), but provide only
rudimentary imaging capabilities. On the other hand, Fresnel lenses offer
extremely good imaging, but with a very small field of view and a requirement

these optics and describes their working principles, their main properties and

correlation functions of composite operators that serve as hadronic
interpolating fields. One of the challenges of loop corrections to QCD
correlation functions in conventional approaches is the renormalization-induced
mixing of composite operators. This involves a multi-step process of first
renormalizing the operators, and then calculating the correlation functions in
this mixed basis. This process becomes increasingly complicated as the number
of operators mixed under renormalization increases, a situation that is
exacerbated as the operator mass dimension increases in important physical
systems such as tetraquarks, pentaquarks, and hybrids. Diagrammatic
renormalization provides an alternative to the conventional operator
renormalization approach. Diagrammatic renormalization methods are outlined and
applied to a variety of QCD sum-rule examples of increasing complexity. The
results are benchmarked, and the diagrammatic method is contrasted with the
conventional operator mixing approach. Advantages and conceptual
interpretations of the diagrammatic renormalization approach are outlined and
technical subtleties are explored.

devices performing specialized functions such as predicting the trajectory of
cannon balls. In modern times, this idea has been extended, for example, to
ultrafast nonlinear optics serving as a surrogate analog computer to probe the
behavior of complex phenomena such as rogue waves. Here we discuss a new
paradigm where physical phenomena coded as an algorithm perform computational
imaging tasks. Specifically, diffraction followed by coherent detection, not in
its analog realization but when coded as an algorithm, becomes an image
enhancement tool. Vision Enhancement via Virtual diffraction and coherent
Detection (VEViD) introduced here reimagines a digital image as a spatially
varying metaphoric light field and then subjects the field to the physical
processes akin to diffraction and coherent detection. The term ""Virtual""
captures the deviation from the physical world. The light field is pixelated
and the propagation imparts a phase with an arbitrary dependence on frequency
which can be different from the quadratic behavior of physical diffraction.
Temporal frequencies exist in three bands corresponding to the RGB color
channels of a digital image. The phase of the output, not the intensity,
represents the output image. VEViD is a high-performance low-light-level and
color enhancement tool that emerges from this paradigm. The algorithm is
interpretable and computationally efficient. We demonstrate image enhancement
of 4k video at 200frames per second and show the utility of this physical
algorithm in improving the accuracy of object detection by neural networks

together. In the Martian atmosphere, dust coagulation would increase the
effective particle size, as small particles accrete to larger particles. Murphy
et al. (1990) showed that Brownian coagulation of dust in the Martian
atmosphere was not significant, due to the low dust particle mixing ratios,
while Montmessin et al. (2002) and Fedorova et al. (2014) showed that it mostly
involves particle radii smaller than 0.1 um. However, the effects of
coagulation have never been explored in 3D, during a global dust storm, i.e. in
presence of larger numbers of small particles. Here we revisit this issue by
using the NASA Ames Mars Global Climate Model (MGCM) to investigate the
temporal and spatial changes in dust particle sizes during the 2018 global
storm due to coagulation and the overall impact of these processes on Mars'
climate. Our parameterization for coagulation includes the effect of Brownian
motion, Brownian diffusion enhancement, and gravitational collection. We show
that Brownian motion and Brownian diffusion enhancement dominate gravitational
collection. The impact of coagulation is significant during the storm, with
coagulation rates increased by a factor of 10 compared to non-storm conditions.
The effective particle radius can be increased by a factor of 2 due to
coagulation, leading to a 20K colder atmosphere above 30 km altitude. Overall,
our parameterization improves the representation of the decay phase of the
storm relative to observations. The process remains significant outside the
storm period if large numbers of submicron-sized particles are involved. It may
be possible, in GCMs, to lift larger amounts of submicron-sized particles from
the surface without excess dust buildup in the atmosphere, thus improving the
agreement with some of the observations without diverging from the observed
column opacities.

become a magnet conductor that is manufactured at the scale needed for an
accelerator facility. Among the few materials that actually reach this scale,
Nb$_{3}$Sn is arguably the workhorse conductor for the next generation of
accelerators. Yet, a marketplace pull equivalent to the medical imaging magnet
industry, which consumes close to 1000 tons of commodity-scale Nb-Ti conductor
per year, has not emerged. This aspect greatly complicates the steps that must
be taken to assure readiness of manufacturing for the next accelerator

of extremely high fields at low temperature, are advancing rapidly as magnet
conductors, and the long horizons of large physics projects could provide time
for them to emerge and displace Nb-based materials. We close by examining in
more detail the ecosystem that connects accelerator magnet conductors with
broader industry applications, in particular areas that are presently in rapid
development such as fusion and wind turbines and which would potentially
require hundreds of tons of conductor.

introduce embeddings representing those trends. The embeddings represent
properties of the event which, coupled with the LSTM structure, can be
clustered to identify similar temporally unaligned events. In this paper, we
explore methods of seeding a multivariate LSTM from time-invariant data related
to the geophysical and demographic phenomena being modeled by the LSTM. We
apply these methods on the timeseries data derived from the COVID-19 detected
infection and death cases. We use publicly available socio-economic data to
seed the LSTM models, creating embeddings, to determine whether such seeding
improves case predictions. The embeddings produced by these LSTMs are clustered

communicate over only classical channels, and finally Bob gets a state
$|x_0\rangle+|x_1\rangle$ with some bit strings $x_0$ and $x_1$. Is it possible
that Alice can know $\{x_0,x_1\}$ but Bob cannot? Such a task, called {\it
remote state preparations}, is indeed possible under some complexity
assumptions, and is bases of many quantum cryptographic primitives such as
proofs of quantumness, (classical-client) blind quantum computing, (classical)
verifications of quantum computing, and quantum money. A typical technique to
realize remote state preparations is to use 2-to-1 trapdoor collision resistant
hash functions: Alice sends a 2-to-1 trapdoor collision resistant hash function
$f$ to Bob, and Bob evaluates it on superposition and measures the image. Bob's
post-measurement state is $|x_0\rangle+|x_1\rangle$, where $f(x_0)=f(x_1)=y$.
With the trapdoor, Alice can learn $\{x_0,x_1\}$, but due to the collision
resistance, Bob cannot. This Alice's advantage can be leveraged to realize the
quantum cryptographic primitives listed above. It seems that the collision
resistance is essential here. In this paper, surprisingly, we show that the
collision resistance is not necessary for a restricted case: we show that
(non-verifiable) remote state preparations of $|x_0\rangle+|x_1\rangle$ secure
against {\it classical} probabilistic polynomial-time Bob can be constructed
from classically-secure (full-domain) trapdoor permutations. Trapdoor
permutations are not likely to imply the collision resistance, because
black-box reductions from collision-resistant hash functions to trapdoor
permutations are known to be impossible. As an application of our result, we
construct proofs of quantumness from classically-secure (full-domain) trapdoor

equation is widely used in simulations and stability analyses of free and
wall-bounded viscoelastic shear flows due to its relative simplicity and
accuracy in predicting macroscopic properties of dilute polymer solutions. The
model contains three independent material parameters, which expressed in
dimensionless form correspond to a Weissenberg number ($\textrm{Wi}$), i.e.,
the ratio of the dumbbell relaxation time scale to a characteristic flow time
scale, a finite extensibility parameter ($L$), corresponding to the ratio of
the fully extended dumbbell length to the root mean square end-to-end
separation of the polymer chain under equilibrium conditions, and a solvent
viscosity ratio, commonly denoted $\beta$. An exact solution for the
rheological predictions of the FENE-P model in steady simple shear flow is
available [Sureshkumar et al., Phys Fluids (1997)], but the resulting nonlinear
and nested set of equations do not readily reveal the key shear-thinning
physics that dominates at high $\textrm{Wi}$ as a result of the finite
extensibility of the polymer chain. In this note we review a simple way of
evaluating the steady material functions characterizing the nonlinear evolution
of the polymeric contributions to the shear stress and first normal stress
difference as the shear rate increases, provide asymptotic expansions as a
function of $\textrm{Wi}$ , and show that it is in fact possible to construct
universal master curves for these two material functions as well as the
corresponding stress ratio. Steady shear flow experiments on three highly
elastic dilute polymer solutions of different finite extensibilities also
follow the identified master curves. The governing dimensionless parameter for
these master curves is $\textrm{Wi}/L$ and it is only in strong shear flows
exceeding $\textrm{Wi}/L \gtrsim 1$ that the effects of finite extensibility of
the polymer chains dominate the evolution of polymeric stresses in the flow
field. We suggest that reporting the magnitude of $\textrm{Wi}/L$ when

the correlation in data, such as behavioral correlation in collaborative
filtering, feature-feature, or feature-behavior correlation in click-through

rather than correlation, and correlation does not imply causation. For example,
the recommender systems can recommend a battery charger to a user after buying
a phone, in which the latter can serve as the cause of the former, and such a
causal relation cannot be reversed. Recently, to address it, researchers in
recommender systems have begun to utilize causal inference to extract
causality, enhancing the recommender system. In this survey, we comprehensively
review the literature on causal inference-based recommendation. At first, we
present the fundamental concepts of both recommendation and causal inference as
the basis of later content. We raise the typical issues that the non-causality
recommendation is faced. Afterward, we comprehensively review the existing work
of causal inference-based recommendation, based on a taxonomy of what kind of

  for Few-Shot Classification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Few-shot classification which aims to recognize unseen classes using very
limited samples has attracted more and more attention. Usually, it is
formulated as a metric learning problem. The core issue of few-shot
classification is how to learn (1) consistent representations for images in
both support and query sets and (2) effective metric learning for images
between support and query sets. In this paper, we show that the two challenges
can be well modeled simultaneously via a unified Query-Support TransFormer
(QSFormer) model. To be specific,the proposed QSFormer involves global
query-support sample Transformer (sampleFormer) branch and local patch
Transformer (patchFormer) learning branch. sampleFormer aims to capture the
dependence of samples in support and query sets for image representation. It
adopts the Encoder, Decoder and Cross-Attention to respectively model the
Support, Query (image) representation and Metric learning for few-shot
classification task. Also, as a complementary to global learning branch, we
adopt a local patch Transformer to extract structural representation for each
image sample by capturing the long-range dependence of local image patches. In
addition, a novel Cross-scale Interactive Feature Extractor (CIFE) is proposed
to extract and fuse multi-scale CNN features as an effective backbone module
for the proposed few-shot learning method. All modules are integrated into a
unified framework and trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on
four popular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the
proposed QSFormer.

system parameters as states and considers their uncertainty effect in the

of this work also apply within the Extended Kalman filter framework. More
importantly, they are shown to handle nonlinearities, larger initial
uncertainties, and poorly conditioned systems better than a typical Extended or

devising first principle models for human-like behaviors is generally
infeasible. In this work, we take a data-driven approach and propose a method
that can learn to generate traffic behaviors from real-world driving logs. The
method achieves high sample efficiency and behavior diversity by exploiting the
bi-level hierarchy of driving behaviors by decoupling the traffic simulation
problem into high-level intent inference and low-level driving behavior
imitation. The method also incorporates a planning module to obtain stable
long-horizon behaviors. We empirically validate our method, named Bi-level
Imitation for Traffic Simulation (BITS), with scenarios from two large-scale
driving datasets and show that BITS achieves balanced traffic simulation
performance in realism, diversity, and long-horizon stability. We also explore
ways to evaluate behavior realism and introduce a suite of evaluation metrics

directions and manipulates latent codes to edit various attributes in images
generated by generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, in previous work,
spatial control is limited to simple transformations (e.g., translation and
rotation), and it is laborious to identify appropriate latent directions and
adjust their parameters. In this paper, we tackle the problem of editing the
StyleGAN image layout by annotating the image directly. To do so, we propose an
interactive framework for manipulating latent codes in accordance with the user
inputs. In our framework, the user annotates a StyleGAN image with locations
they want to move or not and specifies a movement direction by mouse dragging.
From these user inputs and initial latent codes, our latent transformer based
on a transformer encoder-decoder architecture estimates the output latent
codes, which are fed to the StyleGAN generator to obtain a result image. To
train our latent transformer, we utilize synthetic data and pseudo-user inputs
generated by off-the-shelf StyleGAN and optical flow models, without manual
supervision. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method over existing methods.

Furthermore, the fractional charges form a new disordered anyon phase with a
highly distorted edge spin density wave, containing numerous localized magnetic
moments residing on the zigzag edges, thereby displaying spin-charge separation
and a strong non-local correlation between the opposite zigzag edges. We make
the following new predictions, which can be experimentally tested: (1) In the
low doping case and weak disorder regime, the soft gap in the tunneling density
of states is replaced by a sharp peak at the midgap energy with two
accompanying peaks. The $e^-/2$ fractional charges that reside on the boundary
of the zigzag edges are responsible for these peaks. (2) We find that the

Contrastive learning, as an unsupervised learning method, can more effectively
utilize unlabeled medical images. In this paper, we used a Transformer-based

establishing virtual gates to control each subsystem independently, a quantum

  arXiv:1812.01393 by other authors",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Arbitrary shape text detection is a challenging task due to the significantly
varied sizes and aspect ratios, arbitrary orientations or shapes, inaccurate
annotations, etc. Due to the scalability of pixel-level prediction,
segmentation-based methods can adapt to various shape texts and hence attracted
considerable attention recently. However, accurate pixel-level annotations of
texts are formidable, and the existing datasets for scene text detection only
provide coarse-grained boundary annotations. Consequently, numerous
misclassified text pixels or background pixels inside annotations always exist,
degrading the performance of segmentation-based text detection methods.
Generally speaking, whether a pixel belongs to text or not is highly related to
the distance with the adjacent annotation boundary. With this observation, in
this paper, we propose an innovative and robust segmentation-based detection
method via probability maps for accurately detecting text instances. To be
concrete, we adopt a Sigmoid Alpha Function (SAF) to transfer the distances
between boundaries and their inside pixels to a probability map. However, one
probability map can not cover complex probability distributions well because of
the uncertainty of coarse-grained text boundary annotations. Therefore, we
adopt a group of probability maps computed by a series of Sigmoid Alpha
Functions to describe the possible probability distributions. In addition, we
propose an iterative model to learn to predict and assimilate probability maps
for providing enough information to reconstruct text instances. Finally, simple
region growth algorithms are adopted to aggregate probability maps to complete
text instances. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of detection accuracy on several
benchmarks.

this challenge, here we propose parallel-tasking geometric phase metasurfaces.
Indeed, the broadband geometric phase of meta-atoms is divided into several

light phase, amplitude, and polarization through geometric phase, interference,
and orthogonal polarization beam superposition, respectively. Therefore, the
macroscopic group of meta-atoms leads to the metasurfaces that can achieve the
broadband full-dimensional spatial light meta-modulation. Finally, we fabricate
and experimentally demonstrate the meta-modulator that generates special

When only few labeled nodes are available, how to improve their robustness is a

Though self-training has been shown to be powerful for semi-supervised
learning, its application on graph-structured data may fail because (1) larger
receptive fields are not leveraged to capture long-range node interactions,
which exacerbates the difficulty of propagating feature-label patterns from

confinement is key to many emergent phenomena in active systems. For living
active matter consisting of animal cells or motile bacteria, the confinement
boundary is often a deformable interface, and it has been unclear how
activity-induced interface dynamics might lead to morphogenesis and pattern
formation. Here we studied the evolution of bacterial active matter confined by
a deformable boundary. We discovered that an ordered morphological pattern
emerged at the interface characterized by periodically-spaced interfacial
protrusions; behind the interfacial protrusions, bacterial swimmers
self-organized into multicellular clusters displaying +1/2 nematic defects.
Subsequently, a hierarchical sequence of transitions from interfacial
protrusions to creeping branches allowed the bacterial active drop to rapidly
invade surrounding space with a striking self-similar branch pattern. We found
that this interface patterning is controlled by the local curvature of the
interface, a phenomenon we denote as collective curvature sensing. Using a
continuum active model, we revealed that the collective curvature sensing
arises from enhanced active stresses near high-curvature regions, with the
active length-scale setting the characteristic distance between the interfacial
protrusions. Our findings reveal a protrusion-to-branch transition as a novel
mode of active matter invasion and suggest a new strategy to engineer pattern
formation of active materials.

effective technique to tackle imbalanced learning through generating synthetic
samples for the minority class. While numerous over-sampling algorithms have
been proposed, they heavily rely on heuristics, which could be sub-optimal
since we may need different sampling strategies for different datasets and base
classifiers, and they cannot directly optimize the performance metric.
Motivated by this, we investigate developing a learning-based over-sampling
algorithm to optimize the classification performance, which is a challenging
task because of the huge and hierarchical decision space. At the high level, we
need to decide how many synthetic samples to generate. At the low level, we
need to determine where the synthetic samples should be located, which depends
on the high-level decision since the optimal locations of the samples may
differ for different numbers of samples. To address the challenges, we propose
AutoSMOTE, an automated over-sampling algorithm that can jointly optimize
different levels of decisions. Motivated by the success of
SMOTE~\cite{chawla2002smote} and its extensions, we formulate the generation
process as a Markov decision process (MDP) consisting of three levels of
policies to generate synthetic samples within the SMOTE search space. Then we
leverage deep hierarchical reinforcement learning to optimize the performance
metric on the validation data. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets

amounts of temporal data. However, an inescapable problem of high utility
itemset mining is that its discovered results hide the quantities of patterns,
which causes poor interpretability. The results only reflect the shopping
trends of customers, which cannot help decision makers quantify collected
information. In linguistic terms, computers use mathematical or programming
languages that are precisely formalized, but the language used by humans is
always ambiguous. In this paper, we propose a novel one-phase temporal fuzzy
utility itemset mining approach called TFUM. It revises temporal fuzzy-lists to
maintain less but major information about potential high temporal fuzzy utility
itemsets in memory, and then discovers a complete set of real interesting
patterns in a short time. In particular, the remaining measure is the first
adopted in the temporal fuzzy utility itemset mining domain in this paper. The
remaining maximal temporal fuzzy utility is a tighter and stronger upper bound
than that of previous studies adopted. Hence, it plays an important role in
pruning the search space in TFUM. Finally, we also evaluate the efficiency and
effectiveness of TFUM on various datasets. Extensive experimental results
indicate that TFUM outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of
runtime cost, memory usage, and scalability. In addition, experiments prove
that the remaining measure can significantly prune unnecessary candidates

We report
results from a body-inclusive large eddy simulation (LES) of a wake in
nonlinear stratification, specifically for a circular disk at diameter-based
Reynolds number ($Re$) of $5000$. Five density profiles are considered; the
benchmark has linear stratification and the other four have hyperbolic tangent
profiles to model a pycnocline. The disk moves inside the central core of the
pycnocline in two of those four cases and, in the other two cases with {a}
shifted density profile, the disk moves partially/completely outside the
pycnocline. The maximum buoyancy frequency ($N_{max}$) for all the profiles is
the same. The first part of the study investigates the centered cases.
Nonuniform stratification results in increasing wake turbulence relative to the
benchmark owing to reduced suppression of turbulence production as well as the
wave trapping in the pycnocline. Steady lee waves are also quantified to
understand limitations of linear theory. The second part pays attention to the
effect of a relative shift between the pycnocline and the disk. The wake defect
velocity decays faster in the cases with a shift. The effect of disk location
on the Kelvin wake waves (a family of steady waves within the pycnocline) and
its modal form is obtained and explained by solving the Taylor-Goldstein
equation. The family of unsteady internal gravity waves that are generated by
the wake is also studied and the effect of disk shift is quantified.

skeleton modalities. Nevertheless, how to model and utilize this information
remains a challenging problem for self-supervised 3D action representation
learning. In this work, we formulate the cross-modal interaction as a
bidirectional knowledge distillation problem. Different from classic
distillation solutions that transfer the knowledge of a fixed and pre-trained
teacher to the student, in this work, the knowledge is continuously updated and
bidirectionally distilled between modalities. To this end, we propose a new
Cross-modal Mutual Distillation (CMD) framework with the following designs. On
the one hand, the neighboring similarity distribution is introduced to model
the knowledge learned in each modality, where the relational information is
naturally suitable for the contrastive frameworks. On the other hand,
asymmetrical configurations are used for teacher and student to stabilize the
distillation process and to transfer high-confidence information between
modalities. By derivation, we find that the cross-modal positive mining in
previous works can be regarded as a degenerated version of our CMD. We perform
extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD II datasets.
Our approach outperforms existing self-supervised methods and sets a series of

learning approaches, we instead propose to analyse suspicious URLs from SIEM
alerts via the perspective of malicious URL campaigns. By first grouping URLs
within 311M records gathered from VirusTotal into 2.6M suspicious clusters, we
thereafter discovered 77.8K malicious campaigns. Corroborating our suspicions,

confer insights on evasive tactics such as ever lengthier URLs and more diverse

recombining plasma from a number of dynamically evolved objects. To help
decipher its formation mechanism, we have developed a new simulation framework
capable of modeling the time evolution of the ionization state of the plasma in
an SNR. The platform is based on a one-dimensional hydrodynamics code coupled
to a fully time-dependent non-equilibrium ionization calculation, accompanied
by a spectral synthesis code to generate space-resolved broadband X-ray spectra
for SNRs at arbitrary ages. We perform a comprehensive parametric survey to
investigate the effects of different circumstellar environments on the
ionization state evolution in SNRs up to a few 10,000 years. A two-dimensional
parameter space, spanned by arrays of interstellar medium (ISM) densities and
mass-loss rates of the progenitor, is used to create a grid of models for the
surrounding environment, in which a core-collapse explosion is triggered. Our
results show that a recombining plasma can be successfully reproduced in the
case of a young SNR (a few 100 to 1,000 years old) expanding fast in a
spatially extended low-density wind, an old SNR (> a few 1,000 years) expanding

X-ray nuclear transient, eRASSt J045650.3-203750 (hereafter J0456-20),
uncovered by SRG/eROSITA in a quiescent galaxy at redshift of z~0.077. The main
results are: 1) J0456-20 cycles through four distinctive phases: an X-ray
rising phase leading into an X-ray plateau phase which lasts for ~2 months.
This is terminated by a rapid X-ray flux drop phase during which the X-ray flux
can drastically drop by more than a factor of 100 within 1 week followed by an
X-ray faint state for about two months before it starts the X-ray rising phase
again; 2) the X-ray spectra are generally soft in the rising phase with a
photon index >3.0, and become harder as the X-ray flux increases. There is
evidence of a multi-colour disk with inner region temperature of
$T_\text{in}=70$ eV at the beginning of the X-ray rising phase. The high
quality XMM-Newton data suggest that a warm and hot corona could be responsible
for the X-ray emission, through inverse Comptonisation of soft disk seed
photons, during the plateau phase and at the bright end of the rising phase; 3)
J0456-20 shows only moderate UV variability and no significant optical
variability; 4) radio emission is only detected (as yet) in the X-ray plateau
phase, and shows a rapid decline on a time-scale of 2 weeks. We conclude that
J0456-20 is likely a repeating nuclear transient with a tentative recurrence
time of ~223 days. We discuss several possibilities to explain J0456-20's
observational properties, and currently favour a repeating partial tidal
disruption event (TDE) as the most likely scenario. The long-term X-ray
evolution is explained as a transition between a thermal disk-dominated soft
state and a steep power-law state, implying that the corona can be formed
within a few months and destroyed within a few weeks.

quasiparticle bands near the Fermi level with strong momentum dependence: the
ferromagnetism manifests through possibly exchange-split bands (Q1) below $T_C$
, while the spin/orbital screenings lead to gradual development of
quasiparticles (Q2) upon cooling. Our results demonstrate how the
characteristic spin/orbital coherence in a Hund's metal could coexist and
compete with the magnetic order to form a weak itinerant ferromagnet, via
quasiparticle bands that are well separated in momentum space and exhibit
distinct temperature dependence. Our results imply that the competition between
the spin/orbital screening and the magnetic order in a Hund's metal bears
intriguing similarity to the Kondo lattice systems.

planar substrates are systematically studied within the entire spectrum of
microscopic to macroscopic length scales by means of a unified classical
density functional theory (DFT) approach. This is in contrast to previous
investigations, which are applicable either to short or to long length scales.
It turns out that interactions with microscopic ranges, e.g., due to the hard
cores of the fluid molecules and ions, have negligible influence on the
formation of non-uniform lateral structures of the electrolyte solutions. This
partly justifies the Debye-H\""uckel approximation schemes applied in previous
studies of that system. In general, a coupling between the lateral and the
normal fluid structures leads to the phenomenology that, upon increasing the
distance from the substrate, less details of the lateral non-uniformities
contribute to the fluid structure, such that ultimately only large-scale
surface features remain relevant. It can be expected that this picture also
applies to other fluids characterized by several length scales.

privacy-preserving integrated analysis across multiple institutions. DC
analysis centralizes individually constructed dimensionality-reduced
intermediate representations and realizes integrated analysis via collaboration
representations without sharing the original data. To construct the
collaboration representations, each institution generates and shares a
shareable anchor dataset and centralizes its intermediate representation.
Although, random anchor dataset functions well for DC analysis in general,
using an anchor dataset whose distribution is close to that of the raw dataset
is expected to improve the recognition performance, particularly for the
interpretable DC analysis. Based on an extension of the synthetic minority
over-sampling technique (SMOTE), this study proposes an anchor data
construction technique to improve the recognition performance without
increasing the risk of data leakage. Numerical results demonstrate the
efficiency of the proposed SMOTE-based method over the existing anchor data
constructions for artificial and real-world datasets. Specifically, the
proposed method achieves 9 percentage point and 38 percentage point performance
improvements regarding accuracy and essential feature selection, respectively,
over existing methods for an income dataset. The proposed method provides
another use of SMOTE not for imbalanced data classifications but for a key
technology of privacy-preserving integrated analysis.

framework, where each training instance is associated with a candidate label
set, among which only one label is valid. To solve PLL problems, typically
methods try to perform disambiguation for candidate sets by either using prior
knowledge, such as structure information of training data, or refining model
outputs in a self-training manner. Unfortunately, these methods often fail to
obtain a favorable performance due to the lack of prior information or
unreliable predictions in the early stage of model training. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework for partial label learning with meta objective guided
disambiguation (MoGD), which aims to recover the ground-truth label from
candidate labels set by solving a meta objective on a small validation set.
Specifically, to alleviate the negative impact of false positive labels, we
re-weight each candidate label based on the meta loss on the validation set.
Then, the classifier is trained by minimizing the weighted cross entropy loss.
The proposed method can be easily implemented by using various deep networks
with the ordinary SGD optimizer. Theoretically, we prove the convergence
property of meta objective and derive the estimation error bounds of the
proposed method. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and
real-world PLL datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve
competent performance when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Without the need for labeled anchor links, unsupervised alignment methods have

assumptions defined by existing methods are generally low-order and less
accurate because only the edge-indiscriminative topological pattern is
considered, which is especially risky in an unsupervised setting. To reposition
the focus of the alignment process from low-order to higher-order topological
consistency, in this paper, we propose a fully unsupervised network alignment
framework named HTC. The proposed higher-order topological consistency is
formulated based on edge orbits, which is merged into the information
aggregation process of a graph convolutional network so that the alignment
consistencies are transformed into the similarity of node embeddings.
Furthermore, the encoder is trained to be multi-orbit-aware and then be refined
to identify more trusted anchor links. Node correspondence is comprehensively
evaluated by integrating all different orders of consistency. {In addition to
sound theoretical analysis, the superiority of the proposed method is also
empirically demonstrated through extensive experimental evaluation. On three
pairs of real-world datasets and two pairs of synthetic datasets, our HTC
consistently outperforms a wide variety of unsupervised and supervised methods
with the least or comparable time consumption. It also exhibits robustness to
structural noise as a result of our multi-orbit-aware training mechanism.

class and their corresponding labels, (2) unlabeled observations from both
positive and negative classes. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been
used to reduce the problem to the supervised setting with the advantage that
supervised learning has state-of-the-art accuracy in classification tasks. In
order to generate \textit{pseudo}-negative observations, GANs are trained on
positive and unlabeled observations with a modified loss. Using both positive
and \textit{pseudo}-negative observations leads to a supervised learning
setting. The generation of pseudo-negative observations that are realistic
enough to replace missing negative class samples is a bottleneck for current
GAN-based algorithms. By including an additional classifier into the GAN
architecture, we provide a novel GAN-based approach. In our suggested method,
the GAN discriminator instructs the generator only to produce samples that fall
into the unlabeled data distribution, while a second classifier (observer)
network monitors the GAN training to: (i) prevent the generated samples from
falling into the positive distribution; and (ii) learn the features that are
the key distinction between the positive and negative observations. Experiments
on four image datasets demonstrate that our trained observer network performs
better than existing techniques in discriminating between real unseen positive
and negative samples.

science fireball observations. We derive key concepts for the identified
interoperability issues that are generalizable to observational data in other
fields of science. These key concepts contain several modeling challenges, and
we broadly describe each modeling challenges associated with its
interoperability issue. We believe, that addressing these challenges with a set
of ontology design patterns will be an effective means for unified semantic
modeling, paving the way for a unified approach for resolving interoperability
issues in observational data. We demonstrate this with one design pattern,
highlighting the importance and need for ontology design patterns for
observational data, and leave the remaining patterns to future work. Our paper
thus describes interoperability issues along with modeling challenges as a

line bundle $L$ on a projective variety $X$. Recently it is shown in
\cite{HLMP} that there are many cases where $(X,L)$ satisfies property
$\textsf{QR} (3)$ in the sense that the homogeneous ideal $I(X,L)$ of $X$ is
generated by quadratic polynomials of rank $3$. The locus $\Phi_3 (X,L)$ of
rank $3$ quadratic equations of $X$ in $\P \left( I(X,L)_2 \right)$ is a
projective algebraic set, and property $\textsf{QR} (3)$ of $(X,L)$ is
equivalent to that $\Phi_3 (X)$ is nondegenerate in $\P \left( I(X)_2 \right)$.
  In this paper we study geometric structures of $\Phi_3 (X,L)$ such as its
minimal irreducible decomposition. Let \begin{equation*} \Sigma (X,L) = \{
(A,B) ~|~ A,B \in {\rm Pic}(X),~L = A^2 \otimes B,~h^0 (X,A) \geq 2,~h^0 (X,B)
\geq 1 \}. \end{equation*} We first construct a projective subvariety $W(A,B)
\subset \Phi_3 (X,L)$ for each $(A,B)$ in $\Sigma (X,L)$. Then we prove that
the equality \begin{equation*} \Phi_3 (X,L) ~=~ \bigcup_{(A,B) \in \Sigma
(X,L)} W(A,B) \end{equation*} holds when $X$ is locally factorial. Thus this is
an irreducible decomposition of $\Phi_3 (X,L)$ when ${\rm Pic} (X)$ is finitely
generated and hence $\Sigma(X,L)$ is a finite set. Also we find a condition
that the above irreducible decomposition is minimal. For example, it is a
minimal irreducible decomposition of $\Phi_3 (X,L)$ if ${\rm Pic}(X)$ is
generated by a very ample line bundle.

the light-curve duration and X-ray S/N. We find that it is possible to
accurately measure the BH mass in AGN using excess variance measurements in the

applied. The minimum necessary S/N and duration of the light curves used to
compute the excess variance ought to be 3 and approximately 100 ks,

risks by focusing on polygenic scores and phenotypic information. Our
methodology is based on the tool-supported privacy risk analysis method Privug.
We demonstrate the use of Privug to assess privacy risks posed by disclosing a
polygenic trait score for bitter taste receptors, encoded by TAS2R38 and
TAS2R16, to a person's privacy in regards to their ethnicity. We provide an
extensive privacy risks analysis of different programs for genetic data

polygenic score.

Furthermore, the problem of high bubble depth in advanced devices can be
resolved with this method. Four examples are demonstrated, which were
implemented in a Xilinx Artix-7 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device,
and encoding method presented in this paper was employed to encode fine time
data for normal TDL TDC, a half-length delay line TDC, and double-edge and
four-edge wave union TDCs. Compared with TDCs from the latest published papers
that adopt traditional encoders, the logic utilization of TDCs in this paper
were reduced by a factor of 45% to 70% in different situations, while the
encoding dead time can be restricted in one clock cycle. Acceptable resolutions
of the demonstrated TDCs were also obtained, proving the functionality of the

Besides the linear regime, recently, nonlinear charge-spin conversion under the

with nontrivial spin textures, opening an emerging field of nonlinear
spintronics. Here, we report the investigation of both linear and nonlinear
charge-spin conversion in one single topological semimetal SrIrO3(110) thin

momentum space. In the nonlinear regime, the observation of crystalline
direction dependent response indicates the presence of anisotropic surface

spin textures also give rise to spin currents in the linear response regime,
which mainly contributes to the fieldlike SOT component. Our work demonstrates
the power of combination of linear and nonlinear approaches in understanding

that our semi-supervised approach achieves comparable performance to its fully

pre-trimmed with short duration, whilst the provided captions well describe the
gist of the video content. Consequently, for a given paired video and caption,
the video is supposed to be fully relevant to the caption. In reality, however,
as queries are not known a priori, pre-trimmed video clips may not contain
sufficient content to fully meet the query. This suggests a gap between the
literature and the real world. To fill the gap, we propose in this paper a
novel T2VR subtask termed Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR). An
untrimmed video is considered to be partially relevant w.r.t. a given textual

partially relevant videos from a large collection of untrimmed videos. PRVR
differs from single video moment retrieval and video corpus moment retrieval,
as the latter two are to retrieve moments rather than untrimmed videos. We
formulate PRVR as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, where a video is
simultaneously viewed as a bag of video clips and a bag of video frames. Clips
and frames represent video content at different time scales. We propose a
Multi-Scale Similarity Learning (MS-SL) network that jointly learns clip-scale

geometric entities and their projections into the image has been a widely
investigated problem. Although most state-of-the-art methods exploit low-level
primitives such as points or lines, the emergence of very effective CNN-based
object detectors in the recent years has paved the way to the use of
higher-level features carrying semantically meaningful information. Pioneering
works in that direction have shown that modelling 3D objects by ellipsoids and
2D detections by ellipses offers a convenient manner to link 2D and 3D data.
However, the mathematical formalism most often used in the related litterature
does not enable to easily distinguish ellipsoids and ellipses from other
quadrics and conics, leading to a loss of specificity potentially detrimental
in some developments. Moreover, the linearization process of the projection
equation creates an over-representation of the camera parameters, also possibly
causing an efficiency loss. In this paper, we therefore introduce an
ellipsoid-specific theoretical framework and demonstrate its beneficial
properties in the context of pose estimation. More precisely, we first show
that the proposed formalism enables to reduce the pose estimation problem to a
position or orientation-only estimation problem in which the remaining unknowns
can be derived in closed-form. Then, we demonstrate that it can be further
reduced to a 1 Degree-of-Freedom (1DoF) problem and provide the analytical
derivations of the pose as a function of that unique scalar unknown. We
illustrate our theoretical considerations by visual examples and include a
discussion on the practical aspects. Finally, we release this paper along with
the corresponding source code in order to contribute towards more efficient
resolutions of ellipsoid-related pose estimation problems.

the neutron star equation of state (EoS). A softer EoS will reduce the maximum

characteristic function (ChF), gained tremendous popularity among practitioners
and researchers. However, there is clear evidence that a linearity constraint
is insufficient for precise and consistent option pricing. Any non-affine model
must pass the strict requirement of quick calibration -- which is often
challenging. We focus here on Randomized AD (RAnD) models, i.e., we allow for
exogenous stochasticity of the model parameters. Randomization of a pricing
model occurs outside the affine model and, therefore, forms a generalization
that relaxes the affinity constraints. The method is generic and can apply to
any model parameter. It relies on the existence of moments of the so-called
randomizer- a random variable for the stochastic parameter. The RAnD model
allows flexibility while benefiting from fast calibration and well-established,
large-step Monte Carlo simulation, often available for AD processes. The
article will discuss theoretical and practical aspects of the RAnD method, like
derivations of the corresponding ChF, simulation, and computations of
sensitivities. We will also illustrate the advantages of the randomized
stochastic volatility models in the consistent pricing of options on the S&P

quantum objects are the same or different. It is one of the most basic
information processing tasks for learning property of quantum objects, and
comparison of quantum states, quantum channels, and quantum measurements have
been investigated. In general, repeated uses of quantum objects improve the
success probability of comparison. The optimal strategy of pure-state
comparison, the comparison of quantum states for the case of multiple copies of
each unknown pure state, is known, but the optimal strategy of unitary
comparison, the comparison of quantum channels for the case of multiple uses of
each unknown unitary channel, was not known due to the complication of the
varieties of causal order structures among the uses of each unitary channel. In
this paper, we investigate unitary comparison with multiple uses of unitary
channels based on the quantum tester formalism. We obtain the optimal
minimum-error and the optimal unambiguous strategies of unitary comparison of
two unknown $d$-dimensional unitary channels $U_1$ and $U_2$ when $U_1$ can be
used $N_1$ times and $U_2$ can be used $N_2$ times for $N_2 \ge (d-1)N_1$.
These optimal strategies are implemented by parallel uses of the unitary
channels, even though all sequential and adaptive strategies implementable by
the quantum circuit model are considered. When the number of the smaller uses
of the unitary channels $N_1$ is fixed, the optimal averaged success
probability cannot be improved by adding more uses of $U_2$ than $N_2 = (d-1)
N_1$. This feature is in contrast to the case of pure-state comparison, where
adding more copies of the unknown pure states always improves the optimal
averaged success probability. It highlights the difference between
corresponding tasks for states and channels, which has been previously shown
for quantum discrimination tasks.

differential inclusions. This notion finds a natural motivation in the context
of control loops subject to both measurement and actuation disturbances. For
this reason, we say that a dynamical system is strongly robustly safe provided
that it remains safe in the presence a continuous and positive perturbation,
named robustness margin, added to both the argument and the image of the
right-hand side. Therefore, in comparison with existing robust-safety notions,
where the continuous and positive perturbation is added only to the image if
the right-hand side, the proposed notion is shown to be relatively stronger,
especially when the right-hand side is a general set-valued map. Furthermore,
we distinguish between strong robust safety and an even stronger notion named
uniform strong robust safety, which requires the existence of a constant
robustness margin. The first part of this paper proposes sufficient conditions
for strong and uniform strong robust safety in terms of barrier functions. The
proposed conditions involve only the barrier function and the system's
right-hand side. The second part establishes the equivalence between strong
robust safety and the existence of a continuously differentiable barrier
function certifying the notion via an infinitesimal condition. Throughout this

based on an adaptation of the existing quantum non-Gaussianity criteria for

the detector with a vacuum state and two different thermal states to test its
quantum non-Gaussianity. The certification is experimentally demonstrated for
the detector formed by a spatially multiplexed array of ten single-photon
avalanche photodiodes. We confirm the quantum non-Gaussianity of POVM elements
$\hat{\Pi}_m$ associated with the $m$-fold coincidence counts, up to $m=7$. The
experimental ability to certify from the first principles the quantum
non-Gaussian character of $\hat{\Pi}_m$ is for large $m$ limited by low
probability of the measurement outcomes, especially for vacuum input state. We
find that the injection of independent Gaussian background noise into the

reliable confirmation of quantum non-Gaussianity. In addition, we modified and
experimentally verified the quantum non-Gaussianity certification protocol

successes, its methods are still data inefficient, which makes solving numerous
problems prohibitively expensive in terms of data. We aim to remedy this by
taking advantage of the rich supervisory signal in unlabeled data for learning
state representations. This thesis introduces three different representation
learning algorithms that have access to different subsets of the data sources
that traditional RL algorithms use:
  (i) GRICA is inspired by independent component analysis (ICA) and trains a
deep neural network to output statistically independent features of the input.
GrICA does so by minimizing the mutual information between each feature and the
other features. Additionally, GrICA only requires an unsorted collection of
environment states.
  (ii) Latent Representation Prediction (LARP) requires more context: in
addition to requiring a state as an input, it also needs the previous state and
an action that connects them. This method learns state representations by
predicting the representation of the environment's next state given a current
state and action. The predictor is used with a graph search algorithm.
  (iii) RewPred learns a state representation by training a deep neural network
to learn a smoothed version of the reward function. The representation is used
for preprocessing inputs to deep RL, while the reward predictor is used for
reward shaping. This method needs only state-reward pairs from the environment
for learning the representation.
  We discover that every method has their strengths and weaknesses, and
conclude from our experiments that including unsupervised representation
learning in RL problem-solving pipelines can speed up learning.

end, we use Machine Translation (MT) to construct pseudo-parallel sentence
pairs for low-resource languages. However, as MT is not perfect, it tends to
introduce noise during translation, rendering textual embeddings corrupted and
thereby compromising the retrieval performance. To alleviate this, we introduce
a multi-view self-distillation method to learn noise-robust target-language
representations, which employs a cross-attention module to generate soft
pseudo-targets to provide direct supervision from the similarity-based view and
feature-based view. Besides, inspired by the back-translation in unsupervised
MT, we minimize the semantic discrepancies between origin sentences and
back-translated sentences to further improve the noise robustness of the
textual encoder. Extensive experiments are conducted on three video-text and
image-text cross-modal retrieval benchmarks across different languages, and the
results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the overall
performance without using extra human-labeled data. In addition, equipped with
a pre-trained visual encoder from a recent vision-and-language pre-training

the vertex cover number and the treedepth of the constraint graph, as well as
by a selection of related modulator-based parameters. The main findings are as
follows:
  Binary CSP parameterized by the vertex cover number is
$\mathrm{W}[3]$-complete. More generally, for every positive integer $d$,
Binary CSP parameterized by the size of a modulator to a treedepth-d graph is
$\mathrm{W}[2d+1]$-complete. This provides a new family of natural problems
that are complete for odd levels of the W-hierarchy.
  We introduce a new complexity class XSLP, defined so that Binary CSP
parameterized by treedepth is complete for this class. We provide two
equivalent characterizations of XSLP: the first one relates XSLP to a model of
an alternating Turing machine with certain restrictions on conondeterminism and
space complexity, while the second one links XSLP to the problem of
model-checking first-order logic with suitably restricted universal
quantification. Interestingly, the proof of the machine characterization of
XSLP uses the concept of universal trees, which are prominently featured in the
recent work on parity games
  We describe a new complexity hierarchy sandwiched between the W-hierarchy and
the A-hierarchy: For every odd $t$, we introduce a parameterized complexity
class $\mathrm{S}[t]$ with $\mathrm{W}[t]\subseteq \mathrm{S}[t]\subseteq
\mathrm{A}[t]$, defined using a parameter that interpolates between the vertex
cover number and the treedepth.
  We expect that many of the studied classes will be useful in the future for
pinpointing the complexity of various structural parameterizations of graph
problems.

such as clustering and classification. However, there are two challenging
problems plaguing the community: i)how to learn robust multi-view
representation from mass unlabeled data and ii) how to balance the view
consistency and the view specificity. To this end, in this paper, we proposed a
hybrid contrastive fusion algorithm to extract robust view-common
representation from unlabeled data. Specifically, we found that introducing an
additional representation space and aligning representations on this space
enables the model to learn robust view-common representations. At the same
time, we designed an asymmetric contrastive strategy to ensure that the model
does not obtain trivial solutions. Experimental results demonstrated that the
proposed method outperforms 12 competitive multi-view methods on four

representation learning, where hypergraph has been widely used in recent
decades. The performance of hypergraph-based representation learning methods,
such as hypergraph neural networks, highly depends on the quality of the
hypergraph structure. How to generate the hypergraph structure among data is
still a challenging task. Missing and noisy data may lead to ""bad connections""
in the hypergraph structure and destroy the hypergraph-based representation
learning process. Therefore, revealing the high-order structure, i.e., the
hypergraph behind the observed data, becomes an urgent but important task. To
address this issue, we design a general paradigm of deep hypergraph structure
learning, namely DeepHGSL, to optimize the hypergraph structure for
hypergraph-based representation learning. Concretely, inspired by the
information bottleneck principle for the robustness issue, we first extend it
to the hypergraph case, named by the hypergraph information bottleneck (HIB)
principle. Then, we apply this principle to guide the hypergraph structure
learning, where the HIB is introduced to construct the loss function to
minimize the noisy information in the hypergraph structure. The hypergraph
structure can be optimized and this process can be regarded as enhancing the
correct connections and weakening the wrong connections in the training phase.
Therefore, the proposed method benefits to extract more robust representations
even on a heavily noisy structure. Finally, we evaluate the model on four
benchmark datasets for representation learning. The experimental results on
both graph- and hypergraph-structured data demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of our method compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

On Challenges in Anonymizing Source Code",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG cs.PL cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The source code of a program not only defines its semantics but also contains
subtle clues that can identify its author. Several studies have shown that
these clues can be automatically extracted using machine learning and allow for
determining a program's author among hundreds of programmers. This attribution
poses a significant threat to developers of anti-censorship and
privacy-enhancing technologies, as they become identifiable and may be
prosecuted. An ideal protection from this threat would be the anonymization of
source code. However, neither theoretical nor practical principles of such an
anonymization have been explored so far.
  In this paper, we tackle this problem and develop a framework for reasoning
about code anonymization. We prove that the task of generating a $k$-anonymous
program -- a program that cannot be attributed to one of $k$ authors -- is not
computable and thus a dead end for research. As a remedy, we introduce a
relaxed concept called $k$-uncertainty, which enables us to measure the
protection of developers. Based on this concept, we empirically study candidate
techniques for anonymization, such as code normalization, coding style
imitation, and code obfuscation. We find that none of the techniques provides
sufficient protection when the attacker is aware of the anonymization. While we
introduce an approach for removing remaining clues from the code, the main
result of our work is negative: Anonymization of source code is a hard and open

control flow paths i.e., these paths do not occur in any execution of the

is spurious. This affects the precision of the conventional maximum fixed point
(MFP) solution of the data flow analysis, because it includes the information
reaching along all control flow paths. The existing approaches for removing
this imprecision are either specific to a data flow problem with no
straightforward generalization or involve control flow graph restructuring
which may exponentially blow up the size of the CFG.
  We lift the notion of MFP solution to define the notion of feasible path MFP
(FPMFP) solutions that exclude the data flowing along known infeasible paths.
The notion of FPMFP is generic and does not involve CFG restructuring. Instead,
it takes externally supplied information about infeasible paths and lifts any
data flow analysis to an analysis that maintains the distinctions between
different paths where these distinctions are beneficial, and ignores them where
they are not. Thus it gets the benefit of a path-sensitive analysis where it is
useful without performing a conventional path-sensitive analysis.

genuine Bayesian solution out of reach. Here, for a challenging personalized
MCID problem, where the practically-significant threshold depends on patients'

working binary quantile regression model, that can be used for estimation and
inference. The advantage of this formulation is two-fold: we can theoretically
control the bias of the misspecified model and it has a latent variable
representation which we can leverage for efficient Gibbs sampling. To ensure
that the generalized Bayes inferences achieve a level of frequentist
reliability, we propose a variation on the so-called generalized posterior

resources of moving vehicles to offer timely and cost-effective computing
services. However, the dynamic nature of VCs (i.e., limited contact duration
among vehicles), caused by vehicles' mobility, poses unique challenges to the
execution of computation-intensive applications/tasks with directed acyclic
graph (DAG) structure, where each task consists of multiple interdependent
components (subtasks). In this paper, we study scheduling of DAG tasks over
dynamic VCs, where multiple subtasks of a DAG task are dispersed across
vehicles and then processed by cooperatively utilizing vehicles' resources. We
formulate DAG task scheduling as a 0-1 integer programming, aiming to minimize
the overall task completion time, while ensuring a high execution success rate,
which turns out to be NP-hard. To tackle the problem, we develop a ranking and
foresight-integrated dynamic scheduling scheme (RFID). RFID consists of (i) a
dynamic downward ranking mechanism that sorts the scheduling priority of
different subtasks, while explicitly taking into account for the sequential
execution nature of DAG; (ii) a resource scarcity-based priority changing
mechanism that overcomes possible performance degradations caused by the
volatility of VC resources; and (iii) a degree-based weighted earliest finish
time mechanism that assigns the subtask with the highest scheduling priority to
the vehicle which offers rapid task execution along with reliable transmission
links. Our simulation results reveal the effectiveness of our proposed scheme
in comparison to benchmark methods.

large-scale problems that seemed intractable decades ago are now a routine
task. This puts even more real-world applications into the reach of optimizers.
At the same time, solving optimization problems often turns out to be one of
the smaller difficulties when putting solutions into practice. One major
barrier is that the optimization software can be perceived as a black box,
which may produce solutions of high quality, but can create completely
different solutions when circumstances change leading to low acceptance of
optimized solutions. Such issues of interpretability and explainability have
seen significant attention in other areas, such as machine learning, but less
so in optimization. In this paper we propose an optimization framework that
inherently comes with an easily interpretable optimization rule, that explains
under which circumstances certain solutions are chosen. Focusing on decision
trees to represent interpretable optimization rules, we propose integer
programming formulations as well as a heuristic method that ensure
applicability of our approach even for large-scale problems. Computational
experiments using random and real-world data indicate that the costs of
inherent interpretability can be very small.

the novel use of a single bandpass filter (s-BPF) is developed for large-area
photovoltaic solar cells and solar cell precursors. This method images the
photoluminescence (PL) emission using a narrow BPF with centre energy in the
high-energy tail of the PL emission taking advantage of the close-to-unity
absorptivity of typical photovoltaic devices with low variability in this
energy range. As a result, the exact value of the sample's absorptivity within
the BPF transmission band is not required. The use of a s-BPF enables the
adaptation of a fully contactless approach to calibrate the absolute PL photon
flux for camera-based spectrally-integrated imaging tools. The method
eliminates the need for knowledge of the imaging system spectral response and
the use of the emission and excitation spectral shapes. Through an appropriate
choice of the BPF centre energy, a range of absorber compositions or a single
absorber with different surface morphologies (e.g., planar vs textured) can be
imaged, all without the need for additional detection optics. The feasibility
of this s-BPF method is first assessed using a high-quality
Cs0.05FA0.79MA0.16Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite neat film. The error in iVOC is
determined to be less than 1.5%. The efficacy of the method is then
demonstrated on device stacks with two different perovskite compositions
commonly used in single-junction and monolithic tandem solar cells.

This involve examination of hourly raw CR counts of an array of neutron
monitors (NMs) spread across different geographical latitudes and longitudes.
Using awk script and computer codes implemented in R-software, the pressure
corrected raw data plots of the NMs were grouped into low-, mid-, and,
high-latitudes. The results show both similarities and differences in the
structural patterns of the GLE signals. In an attempt to explain why the CR
count during the decay phase of GLEs is always higher than the count before
peak, we interpreted all counts prior to the peak as coming from direct solar
neutrons and those in the decay phase including the peak as coming from
secondary CR neutrons generated by the interactions of primary CRs with the
atoms and molecules in the atmosphere. We identified NMs that detected these
primary neutrons and found that they are close in longitudes. Previous authors
seemingly identified these two species as impulsive and gradual events.
Although there are a number of unexplained manifestations of GLE signals, some
of the results suggest that geomagnetic rigidity effectively determines the
intensity of CRs at low- and mid-latitudes. Its impact is apparently
insignificant in high-latitude regions. Nevertheless, the results presented
should be validated before making any firm statements. Principally, the
contributions of the ever-present and intractable CR diurnal anisotropies to
GLE signals should be accounted for in future work.

demonstrated its superior efficiency to accurately model the occupancy
probability for the compression of geometry component of dense object point

was largely limited. This is because 1) fixed receptive field of the
convolution cannot characterize extremely and unevenly distributed sparse LiDAR
points very well; and 2) pretrained convolutions with fixed weights are
insufficient to dynamically capture information conditioned on the input. This
work therefore suggests the neighborhood point attention (NPA) to tackle them,
where we first use k nearest neighbors (kNN) to construct adaptive local
neighborhood; and then leverage the self-attention mechanism to dynamically
aggregate information within this neighborhood. Such NPA is devised as a
NPAFormer to best exploit cross-scale and same-scale correlations for geometric
occupancy probability estimation. Compared with the anchor using standardized

mRNA with a ballistic model where particles advance along a filament without
excluded volume interactions. Unidirectional models of transport have
previously been used to fit the average density of ribosomes obtained by the
experimental ribo-sequencing (Ribo-seq) technique. In this case an inverse fit
gives access to the kinetic rates: the position-dependent speeds and the entry
rate of ribosomes onto mRNA. The degradation rate is not, however, accounted
for and experimental data from different experiments are needed to have enough
parameters for the fit. Here, we propose an entirely novel experimental setup

depending on the number of ribosomes from one to four. We solve analytically
the ballistic model for a fixed number of ribosomes per mRNA, study the
different regimes of degradation, and propose a criteria for the quality of the
inverse fit. The proposed method provides a high sensitivity to the mRNA
degradation rate. The additional equations coming from using the monosome

impact if we changed the design of the system (a task also known as causal
inference). We make three contributions. First, we expose the complexity of
causal inference in the context of adaptive bit rate video streaming, a
challenging domain where the network conditions during the session act as a
sequence of latent and confounding variables, and a change at any point in the
session has a cascading impact on the rest of the session. Second, we present
Veritas, a novel framework that tackles causal reasoning for video streaming
without resorting to randomised trials. Integral to Veritas is an easy to
interpret domain-specific ML model (an embedded Hidden Markov Model) that
relates the latent stochastic process (intrinsic bandwidth that the video
session can achieve) to actual observations (download times) while exploiting
control variables such as the TCP state (e.g., congestion window) observed at
the start of the download of video chunks. We show through experiments on an
emulation testbed that Veritas can answer both counterfactual queries (e.g.,
the performance of a completed video session had it used a different buffer
size) and interventional queries (e.g., estimating the download time for every
possible video quality choice for the next chunk in a session in progress). In
doing so, Veritas achieves accuracy close to an ideal oracle, while
significantly outperforming both a commonly used baseline approach, and Fugu
(an off-the-shelf neural network) neither of which account for causal effects.

mass estimates defined as $M_{\rm{vir}}=K \sigma'^2_{\star,\rm{int}} R$, with
$K$ a scaling factor, $\sigma'_{\star,\rm{int}}$ the spatially-integrated
stellar velocity second moment from the LEGA-C survey and $R$ the effective
radius measured from a S\'ersic profile fit to HST imaging. The sample is
representative for $M_{\star}>3\times10^{10}~M_{\odot}$ and includes all types
of galaxies, irrespective of morphology and color. We demonstrate that using
$R=R_{\rm{sma}}$~(the semi-major axis length of the ellipse that encloses 50\%
of the light) in combination with an inclination correction on
$\sigma'_{\star,\rm{int}}$~produces an unbiased $M_{\rm{vir}}$. We confirm the
importance of projection effects on $\sigma'_{\star,\rm{int}}$ by showing the
existence of a similar residual trend between virial mass estimates and
inclination for the nearby early-type galaxies in the ATLAS$^{\rm{3D}}$~survey.
Also, as previously shown, when using a S\'ersic profile-based $R$ estimate,
then a S\'{e}rsic index-dependent correction to account for non-homology in the
radial profiles is required. With respect to analogous dynamical models for
low-redshift galaxies from the ATLAS$^{\rm{3D}}$~survey we find a systematic
offset of 0.1 dex in the calibrated virial constant for LEGA-C, which may be
due to physical differences between the galaxy samples or an unknown systematic
error. Either way, with our work we establish a common mass scale for galaxies
across 8 Gyr of cosmic time with a systematic uncertainty of at most 0.1 dex.

as a reinforcement learning (RL) process. According to the proposed paradigm,
RL agents learn a policy (i.e. affective interaction) by attempting to maximize
a set of rewards (i.e. behavioral and affective patterns) via their experience
with their environment (i.e. context). Our hypothesis is that RL is an
effective paradigm for interweaving affect elicitation and manifestation with
behavioral and affective demonstrations. Importantly, our second
hypothesis-building on Damasio's somatic marker hypothesis-is that emotion can
be the facilitator of decision-making. We test our hypotheses in a racing game
by training Go-Blend agents to model human demonstrations of arousal and
behavior; Go-Blend is a modified version of the Go-Explore algorithm which has
recently showcased supreme performance in hard exploration tasks. We first vary
the arousal-based reward function and observe agents that can effectively
display a palette of affect and behavioral patterns according to the specified
reward. Then we use arousal-based state selection mechanisms in order to bias
the strategies that Go-Blend explores. Our findings suggest that Go-Blend not
only is an efficient affect modeling paradigm but, more importantly,
affect-driven RL improves exploration and yields higher performing agents,
validating Damasio's hypothesis in the domain of games.

method inspired by the structure prior of BC based on deep learning, which
cascades to implement BCs coarse detection at the WSI-level and fine-grained
classification in patch-level. The coarse detection network is a multi-task
detection framework based on circular bounding boxes for cells detection, and
central key points for nucleus detection. The circle representation reduces the
degrees of freedom, mitigates the effect of surrounding impurities compared to
usual rectangular boxes and can be rotation invariant in WSI. Detecting key
points in the nucleus can assist network perception and be used for
unsupervised color layer segmentation in later fine-grained classification. The
fine classification network consists of a background region suppression module
based on color layer mask supervision and a key region selection module based
on a transformer due to its global modeling capability. Additionally, an
unsupervised and unpaired cytoplasm generator network is firstly proposed to
expand the long-tailed distribution dataset. Finally, experiments are performed
on BC multicenter datasets. The proposed BC fine detection method outperforms

have ever higher core counts, increased parallelism is needed to take advantage
of these new architectures. Traditional serial time-marching schemes can be a
significant bottleneck, as many types of simulations require large numbers of
time-steps which must be computed sequentially. Parallel in Time schemes, such
as the Multigrid Reduction in Time (MGRIT) method, remedy this by parallelizing
across time-steps, and have shown promising results for parabolic problems.
However, chaotic problems have proved more difficult, since chaotic initial
value problems (IVPs) are inherently ill-conditioned. MGRIT relies on a
hierarchy of successively coarser time-grids to iteratively correct the
solution on the finest time-grid, but due to the nature of chaotic systems,
small inaccuracies on the coarser levels can be greatly magnified and lead to
poor coarse-grid corrections. Here we introduce a modified MGRIT algorithm
based on an existing quadratically converging nonlinear extension to the
multigrid Full Approximation Scheme (FAS), as well as a novel time-coarsening
scheme. Together, these approaches better capture long-term chaotic behavior on
coarse-grids and greatly improve convergence of MGRIT for chaotic IVPs.
Further, we introduce a novel low memory variant of the algorithm for solving
chaotic PDEs with MGRIT which not only solves the IVP, but also provides
estimates for the unstable Lyapunov vectors of the system. We provide
supporting numerical results for the Lorenz system and demonstrate parallel
speedup for the chaotic Kuramoto- Sivashinsky partial differential equation
over a significantly longer time-domain than in previous works.

$P$ denoting pseudoscalar quarkonia, respectively. It is assumed that the
leading-order QCD diagrams would give the dominant contributions to these

to capture the pixel-wise luminance intensity at high frame rate. However,
depth estimation with spike camera remains very challenging using traditional
monocular or stereo depth estimation algorithms, which are based on the
photometric consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Guided
Depth Fusion (UGDF) framework to fuse the predictions of monocular and stereo
depth estimation networks for spike camera. Our framework is motivated by the
fact that stereo spike depth estimation achieves better results at close range
while monocular spike depth estimation obtains better results at long range.
Therefore, we introduce a dual-task depth estimation architecture with a joint
training strategy and estimate the distributed uncertainty to fuse the
monocular and stereo results. In order to demonstrate the advantage of spike
depth estimation over traditional camera depth estimation, we contribute a
spike-depth dataset named CitySpike20K, which contains 20K paired samples, for
spike depth estimation. UGDF achieves state-of-the-art results on CitySpike20K,
surpassing all monocular or stereo spike depth estimation baselines. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of our
method on CitySpike20K. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the

speech recognition systems. Such models are trained on large amounts of
labelled data, which are often not available for low-resource languages.
Techniques such as self-supervised learning and transfer learning hold promise,
but have not yet been effective in training accurate models. On the other hand,
collecting labelled datasets on a diverse set of domains and speakers is very
expensive. In this work, we demonstrate an inexpensive and effective
alternative to these approaches by ``mining'' text and audio pairs for Indian
languages from public sources, specifically from the public archives of All
India Radio. As a key component, we adapt the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to
align sentences with corresponding audio segments given a long audio and a PDF
of its transcript, while being robust to errors due to OCR, extraneous text,
and non-transcribed speech. We thus create Shrutilipi, a dataset which contains
over 6,400 hours of labelled audio across 12 Indian languages totalling to
4.95M sentences. On average, Shrutilipi results in a 2.3x increase over
publicly available labelled data. We establish the quality of Shrutilipi with
21 human evaluators across the 12 languages. We also establish the diversity of
Shrutilipi in terms of represented regions, speakers, and mentioned named
entities. Significantly, we show that adding Shrutilipi to the training set of
Wav2Vec models leads to an average decrease in WER of 5.8\% for 7 languages on
the IndicSUPERB benchmark. For Hindi, which has the most benchmarks (7), the
average WER falls from 18.8% to 13.5%. This improvement extends to efficient
models: We show a 2.3% drop in WER for a Conformer model (10x smaller than
Wav2Vec). Finally, we demonstrate the diversity of Shrutilipi by showing that
the model trained with it is more robust to noisy input.

thinned subsequently associated with another flow enhancement centered more on
the dawnward side of the initial flow. MMS and Cluster observed intense
perpendicular and parallel current in the off-equatorial region mainly during
this interval of the current sheet thinning. Maximum field-aligned currents
both at MMS and Cluster are directed tailward. Detailed analysis of MMS data

related to the flow bouncing process and/or to the expansion/activation of
reconnection. Based on these mesoscale and small-scale multipoint observations,
3D evolution of the flow and current-sheet disturbances was inferred preceding
the development of a substorm current wedge.

behavior of complex random normal matrix models that one finds a complementary
error function behavior at the boundary (also called edge) of the droplet as
the matrix size increases. Such behavior is seen both in the density, and in
the off-diagonal case, where the Faddeeva plasma kernel emerges. These results
are neatly expressed with the help of the outward unit normal vector on the
edge. We prove that such universal behaviors transcend this class of random
normal matrices, being also valid in higher dimensional determinantal point
processes, defined on $\mathbb C^d$. The models under consideration concern
higher dimensional generalizations of the determinantal point processes
describing the eigenvalues of the complex Ginibre ensemble and the complex
elliptic Ginibre ensemble. These models describe a system of particles with
mutual repulsion, that are confined to the origin by an external field $V(z) =
|z|^2 - \tau \Re(z_1^2+\ldots+z_d^2)$, where $0\leq \tau<1$. Their average
density of particles converges to a uniform law on a $2d$-dimensional
ellipsoidal region. It is on the boundary of this region that we find a
complementary error function behavior and the Faddeeva plasma kernel. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of the Faddeeva plasma kernel
emerging in a higher dimensional model.

experiment, which demonstrates that in the process of knowledge distillation,
the empirical error of the teacher model degenerates the prediction performance
of the few-shot object detection model as the student. To understand the
reasons behind this phenomenon, we revisit the learning paradigm of knowledge
distillation on the few-shot object detection task from the causal theoretic
standpoint, and accordingly, develop a Structural Causal Model. Following the
theoretical guidance, we propose a backdoor adjustment-based knowledge
distillation method for the few-shot object detection task, namely Disentangle

been widely applied to recommender systems and have shown promising
performance. However, most GCN-based methods rigorously stick to a common GCN
learning paradigm and suffer from two limitations: (1) the limited scalability
due to the high computational cost and slow training convergence; (2) the
notorious over-smoothing issue which reduces performance as stacking graph
convolution layers. We argue that the above limitations are due to the lack of
a deep understanding of GCN-based methods. To this end, we first investigate
what design makes GCN effective for recommendation. By simplifying LightGCN, we
show the close connection between GCN-based and low-rank methods such as
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Matrix Factorization (MF), where
stacking graph convolution layers is to learn a low-rank representation by
emphasizing (suppressing) components with larger (smaller) singular values.
Based on this observation, we replace the core design of GCN-based methods with
a flexible truncated SVD and propose a simplified GCN learning paradigm dubbed
SVD-GCN, which only exploits $K$-largest singular vectors for recommendation.
To alleviate the over-smoothing issue, we propose a renormalization trick to
adjust the singular value gap, resulting in significant improvement. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets show that our proposed SVD-GCN not
only significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts but also achieves over 100x
and 10x speedups over LightGCN and MF, respectively.

smaller supermassive black hole (SMBH) scales by an episodic cycle of feeding
and feedback. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powered by accretion onto SMBH
and the majority of AGN energy, in near-Eddington regime, is produced in thin
sub-pc accretion discs. Currently, it is very difficult to model processes that
occur on vastly different scales, ranging from the circumnuclear gas reservoirs
at tens to hundreds of parsecs, down to the accretion disc scales at <0.01 pc.
While sub-grid prescriptions used in large-scale or cosmological simulations
are able to reproduce large-scale feedback, we propose using a more realistic
model in parsec-scale simulations, where it is important to get accurate
timescales to understand how feedback affects gas dynamics and star formation
in the vicinity of the AGN. To test our approach we use a sub-resolution thin
accretion disc model, coupled to the SMBH, in a set of hydrodynamical
simulations of a retrograde collision between a gas ring and a molecular cloud
in an environment similar to the Galactic centre using the SPH code Gadget-3.
The disc-mediated feeding of the SMBH is relatively smooth and delayed compared
to an instantaneous feeding prescription. While the reduction of accretion due
to feedback is present in both accretion disc and instantaneous feeding
simulations, a clear central cavity appears only in accretion disc runs -
hinting that a less volatile accretion phase could have a greater impact on the
surrounding gas.

include contributions of both transverse and longitudinal virtual photons. We
show that this model gives a very good description of experimental data at
small Bjorken $x$ on deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) from HERA. The
reggeon exchange term is particularly relevant for describing the
real-photon-proton scattering measured at lower $\gamma p$ energies at FNAL. We
present two fits which differ somewhat in the strength of the hard pomeron
contribution. In both fits we find that the interference between soft- and
hard-pomeron exchange plays an important role. We find that in DVCS the
soft-pomeron contribution is considerable up to $Q^{2} \sim 20$ GeV$^{2}$. Our
model allows to study the transition from the small-$Q^{2}$ regime, including
the photoproduction ($Q^{2} = 0$) limit, to the large-$Q^{2}$ regime, the DIS
limit. We also discuss the ratio of cross sections for longitudinally and

  https://github.com/wutong16/Voxurf",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural surface reconstruction aims to reconstruct accurate 3D surfaces based
on multi-view images. Previous methods based on neural volume rendering mostly
train a fully implicit model with MLPs, which typically require hours of
training for a single scene. Recent efforts explore the explicit volumetric
representation to accelerate the optimization via memorizing significant
information with learnable voxel grids. However, existing voxel-based methods
often struggle in reconstructing fine-grained geometry, even when combined with
an SDF-based volume rendering scheme. We reveal that this is because 1) the
voxel grids tend to break the color-geometry dependency that facilitates
fine-geometry learning, and 2) the under-constrained voxel grids lack spatial
coherence and are vulnerable to local minima. In this work, we present Voxurf,
a voxel-based surface reconstruction approach that is both efficient and
accurate. Voxurf addresses the aforementioned issues via several key designs,
including 1) a two-stage training procedure that attains a coherent coarse
shape and recovers fine details successively, 2) a dual color network that
maintains color-geometry dependency, and 3) a hierarchical geometry feature to
encourage information propagation across voxels. Extensive experiments show
that Voxurf achieves high efficiency and high quality at the same time. On the
DTU benchmark, Voxurf achieves higher reconstruction quality with a 20x
training speedup compared to previous fully implicit methods. Our code is

sensitive information, offering theoretical guarantees for privacy but limited
evidence of utility in practical settings. Utility is typically measured as the
error on representative proxy tasks, such as descriptive statistics, accuracy
of trained classifiers, or performance over a query workload. The ability for
these results to generalize to practitioners' experience has been questioned in
a number of settings, including the U.S. Census. In this paper, we propose an
evaluation methodology for synthetic data that avoids assumptions about the
representativeness of proxy tasks, instead measuring the likelihood that
published conclusions would change had the authors used synthetic data, a
condition we call epistemic parity. Our methodology consists of reproducing
empirical conclusions of peer-reviewed papers on real, publicly available data,
then re-running these experiments a second time on DP synthetic data, and
comparing the results.
  We instantiate our methodology over a benchmark of recent peer-reviewed
papers that analyze public datasets in the ICPSR repository. We model
quantitative claims computationally to automate the experimental workflow, and
model qualitative claims by reproducing visualizations and comparing the
results manually. We then generate DP synthetic datasets using multiple
state-of-the-art mechanisms, and estimate the likelihood that these conclusions
will hold. We find that state-of-the-art DP synthesizers are able to achieve
high epistemic parity for several papers in our benchmark. However, some
papers, and particularly some specific findings, are difficult to reproduce for
any of the synthesizers. We advocate for a new class of mechanisms that favor
stronger utility guarantees and offer privacy protection with a focus on
application-specific threat models and risk-assessment.

tailored functional behaviors that have no traditional counterparts. Study and
application of these materials are bringing together scientists and engineers
from physics, chemistry, and materials science. The diversity of each of these
disciplines comes with perspectives and jargon that may be confusing to those
outside of the individual fields, which can result in miscommunication of
important aspects of research. In this perspective, we provide examples of
research and characterization taken from these different fields to provide a
framework for classifying the differences between compositionally complex
oxides, high entropy oxides, and entropy stabilized oxides, which is intended
to bring a common language to this emerging area. We highlight the critical
importance of understanding a materials crystallinity, composition, and mixing
length scales in determining its true definition.

relatively low computational cost by leveraging large, generalized, graph-based

upfront data collection or training. We present catlas, a framework that
distributes and automates the generation of adsorbate-surface configurations
and ML inference of DFT energies to achieve this goal. Catlas is open source,
making ML assisted catalyst screenings easy and available to all. To
demonstrate its efficacy, we use catlas to explore catalyst candidates for the
direct conversion of syngas to multi-carbon oxygenates. For this case study, we
explore 947 stable/ metastable binary, transition metal intermetallics as

limit of a nonperturbative sum over spacetimes, is tantalizingly close to being
amenable to analytical methods, and some of its properties have been described
in terms of effective matrix and other models. To gain a more detailed
understanding of three-dimensional quantum gravity, we perform a numerical
investigation of the nature of spatial hypersurfaces in three-dimensional
Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT). We measure and analyze several quantum
observables, the entropy exponent, the local and global Hausdorff dimensions,
and the quantum Ricci curvature of the spatial slices, and try to match them
with known continuum properties of systems of two-dimensional quantum geometry.
Above the first-order phase transition of CDT quantum gravity, we find strong
evidence that the spatial dynamics lies in the same universality class as
two-dimensional Euclidean (Liouville) quantum gravity. Below the transition,
the behaviour of the spatial slices does not match that of any known quantum
gravity model. This may indicate the existence of a new type of two-dimensional
quantum system, induced by the more complex nature of the embedding
three-dimensional quantum geometry.

problem. Recent conditional lower bounds suggest that it is unlikely that a
strongly subquadratic algorithm exists. Moreover, it is unlikely that we can
approximate the Fr\'echet distance to within a factor $3$ in strongly
subquadratic time, even if $d=1$. The best current results establish a tradeoff
between approximation quality and running time. Specifically, Colombe and Fox
(SoCG, 2021) give an $O(\alpha)$-approximate algorithm that runs in $O((n^3 /

magnetized, rapidly rotating, helium enhanced, early B stars that produce
anomalously wide hydrogen emission due to a centrifugal magnetosphere (CM). The
star is Trumpler 16-26, a B1.5 V member of the Trumpler 16 open cluster. A CM
was initially suspected based on hydrogen Brackett series emission observed in
SDSS/APOGEE $H$-band spectra. Similar to the other stars of this type, the
emission was highly variable and at all times remarkable due to the extreme
velocity separations of the double peaks (up to 1300 km s$^{-1}$.) Another clue
lay in the TESS lightcurve, which shows two irregular eclipses per cycle when
phased with the likely 0.9718115 day rotation period, similar to the behavior
of the well known CM host star $\sigma$ Ori E. To confirm a strong magnetic
field and rotation-phase-locked variability, we initiated a follow-up campaign
consisting of optical spectropolarimetry and spectroscopy. The associated data
revealed a longitudinal magnetic field varying between $-3.1$ and $+1.6$ kG
with the period found from photometry. The optical spectra confirmed rapid
rotation ($v \sin i=195$ km s$^{-1}$), surface helium enhancement, and wide,
variable hydrogen emission. Tr16-26 is thus confirmed as the 20$^{\rm th}$
known, the fourth most rapidly rotating, and the faintest CM host star yet
discovered. With a projected dipole magnetic field strength of $B_{\rm d}>11$
kG, Tr16-26 is also among the most magnetic CM stars.

level necessitate materials with memristive, memcapacitive, and
neuromorphic-like functional properties; in short, the electronic response must
depend on the voltage history, thus enabling learning algorithms. Here we
demonstrate volatile ferroelectric switching of Sn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ at room
temperature and see that initial polarization orientation strongly determines
the properties of polarization switching. In particular, polarization switching
hysteresis is strongly imprinted by the original polarization state, shifting
the regions of non-linearity toward zero-bias. As a corollary, polarization
switching also enables effective capacitive switching, approaching the
sought-after regime of memcapacitance. Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire simulations
demonstrate that one mechanism by which polarization can control the shape of
the hysteresis loop is the existence of charged domain walls decorating the
periphery of the repolarization nucleus. These walls oppose the growth of the
switched domain and favor back-switching, thus creating a scenario of
controlled volatile ferroelectric switching. Although the measurements were
carried out with single crystals, prospectively volatile polarization switching
can be tuned by tailoring sample thickness, domain wall mobility and electric
fields, paving way to non-linear dielectric properties for smart electronic
circuits.

problems such as slice-to-volume registration and 3D reconstruction is
well-studied in preoperative settings. In intraoperative imaging, the utility
of DRRs is limited by the challenges in generating them in real-time and
supporting optimization procedures that rely on repeated DRR synthesis. While
immense progress has been made in accelerating the generation of DRRs through
algorithmic refinements and GPU implementations, DRR-based optimization remains
slow because most DRR generators do not offer a straightforward way to obtain
gradients with respect to the imaging parameters. To make DRRs interoperable
with gradient-based optimization and deep learning frameworks, we have
reformulated Siddon's method, the most popular ray-tracing algorithm used in
DRR generation, as a series of vectorized tensor operations. We implemented
this vectorized version of Siddon's method in PyTorch, taking advantage of the
library's strong automatic differentiation engine to make this DRR generator
fully differentiable with respect to its parameters. Additionally, using
GPU-accelerated tensor computation enables our vectorized implementation to
achieve rendering speeds equivalent to state-of-the-art DRR generators
implemented in CUDA and C++. We illustrate the resulting method in the context
of slice-to-volume registration. Moreover, our simulations suggest that the
loss landscapes for the slice-to-volume registration problem are convex in the
neighborhood of the optimal solution, and gradient-based registration promises
a much faster solution than prevailing gradient-free optimization strategies.
The proposed DRR generator enables fast computer vision algorithms to support
image guidance in minimally invasive procedures. Our implementation is

an affinity-aware resource provisioning approach for deploying large-scale LRAs

surfaces to form ices such as H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, CH3OH, and NH3. In

present a computationally efficient method to compute ice and bare-grain
opacities in protoplanetary disk models consistently with the chemistry and to
investigate the effect of ice opacities on the physico-chemical state and
optical appearance of the disk. A matrix of Mie efficiencies is pre-calculated
for different ice species and thicknesses, from which the position dependent
opacities of icy grains are then interpolated. This is implemented in the
PRODIMO code by a self-consistent solution of ice opacities and the local
composition of ices, which are obtained from our chemical network. Locally, the
opacity can change significantly, for example, an increase by a factor of more
than 200 in the midplane, especially at UV and optical wavelengths, due to ice
formation. This is mainly due to changes in the size distribution of dust
grains resulting from ice formation. However, since the opacity only changes in
the optically thick regions of the disk, the thermal disk structure does not
change significantly. For the same reason, the spectral energy distributions
computed with our disk models with ice opacities generally show only faint ice
emission features at far-IR wavelengths. The ice absorption features are only
seen in the edgeon orientation. The assumption made on how the ice is
distributed across the grain size distribution influences the far-IR and
millimeter slope of the SED. The ice features and their strengths are
influenced by the ice power law and the type of chemistry. Our models predict
stronger ice features for observations that can spatially resolve the disk,
particularly in absorption.

Microservices. Modern RPC frameworks include for example Thrift, gRPC, SOFARPC

distributed systems and various RPC frameworks the system could employ. To the
best of our knowledge, there does not exist any tool or solution that could
enable automated testing of modern RPC-based services. To fill this gap, in
this paper we propose the first approach in the literature, together with an
open-source tool, for white-box fuzzing modern RPC-based APIs with search. To
assess our novel approach, we conducted an empirical study with two artificial

integrated into a real industrial pipeline, and could be applied to real
industrial development process for fuzzing RPC-based APIs. To further
demonstrate its effectiveness and application in industrial settings, we also
report results of employing our tool for fuzzing another 50 industrial APIs
autonomously conducted by our industrial partner in their testing processes.
Results show that our novel approach is capable of enabling automated test case
generation for industrial RPC-based APIs (i.e., two artificial and 54

manually written tests. Our white-box solution achieves significant
improvements on code coverage. Regarding fault detection, by conducting a
careful review with our industrial partner of the tests generated by our novel

the structures are highly constrained, generating uniformly distributed inputs
is difficult. In this paper, we present Testify: a framework in which users can
define algebraic data-types decorated with high-level constraints. These
constraints are interpreted as membership predicates that restrict the set of
inhabitants of the type. From these definitions, Testify automatically
synthesises a partial specification of the program so that no function produces
a value that violates the constraints (e.g. a binary search tree where nodes
are improperly inserted). Our framework augments the original program with
tests that check such properties. To achieve that, we automatically produce
uniform random samplers that generate values which satisfy the constraints, and
verifies the validity of the outputs of the tested functions. By generating the
shape of a recursive data-structure using Boltzmann sampling and generating
evenly distributed finite domain variable values using constraint solving, our
framework guarantees size-constrained uniform sampling of test cases. We
provide use-cases of our framework on several key data structures that are of
practical relevance for developers. Experiments show encouraging results.

susceptible to adversarial attacks targeting the graph structure. A malicious
attacker can manipulate a limited number of edges, given the training labels,
to impair the victim model's performance. Previous empirical studies indicate
that gradient-based attackers tend to add edges rather than remove them. In
this paper, we present a theoretical demonstration revealing that attackers
tend to increase inter-class edges due to the message passing mechanism of
GNNs, which explains some previous empirical observations. By connecting
dissimilar nodes, attackers can more effectively corrupt node features, making
such attacks more advantageous. However, we demonstrate that the inherent
smoothness of GNN's message passing tends to blur node dissimilarity in the
feature space, leading to the loss of crucial information during the forward
process. To address this issue, we propose a novel surrogate model with
multi-level propagation that preserves the node dissimilarity information. This
model parallelizes the propagation of unaggregated raw features and multi-hop
aggregated features, while introducing batch normalization to enhance the
dissimilarity in node representations and counteract the smoothness resulting
from topological aggregation. Our experiments show significant improvement with
our approach.Furthermore, both theoretical and experimental evidence suggest
that adding inter-class edges constitutes an easily observable attack pattern.
We propose an innovative attack loss that balances attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility, sacrificing some attack effectiveness to attain greater
imperceptibility. We also provide experiments to validate the compromise
performance achieved through this attack loss.

attributed to an enhanced pre-burst/persistent emission or the Comptonization
of the burst emission by the corona/boundary layer. The Comptonization model is
a convolution thermal-Comptonization model (thcomp in XSPEC) and the
Comptonization parameters are fixed at the values derived from the persistent

pre-burst/persistent emission or the Comptonization of the burst emission is
removed, the NS surface emission shows a plateau, and then a rise until the
photosphere touches down to the NS surface, resulting in a flux peak at that
moment. We speculate that the findings above correspond to that the obscured
lower part of the NS surface by the disk is exposed to the line of sight due to
the inner disk evaporation by the burst emission. The consistency between the
fa model and convolution thermal-Comptonization model indicates the interplay
between thermonuclear bursts and accretion environments. These phenomena did
not usually show up by the conventional blackbody model fitting, which may be
due to low count rate and narrow energy coverage in previous observations.

increasingly important because conventional methods, relying on indirect
assessments, such as reflectance/transmittance, are inaccurate or even
unfeasible to characterize state-of-art devices with novel spectra,
directionalities, and polarizations. The direct collection of the far-field
emission from these tiny devices is also challenging because of their shrinking
footprints and uncontrollable radiation noises from their surroundings. Here,
we demonstrate a microscopic lock-in FTIR system that realizes significant
improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by combining a microscope and a
lock-in amplifier with an FTIR. The lock-in FTIR is ultrasensitive, with a
specific detectivity 10^6 times higher than commercial ones, to overcome the
optical loss and background noise during the emission light collection. Based
on an analytical model of the signal detection process, we also explore the
combination of modulated Joule heating and global heating to fulfill the
potential of our system for noise reduction. Our findings show that, compared
to previous studies, more than 3 times lower temperatures are sufficient to
generate a measurable signal. Under a heating temperature of around 125
{\deg}C, we can achieve an SNR of about 23.7, which is far above the
true-signal-threshold (SNR of about 3.0). Furthermore, the system can respond
fast enough (up to 175kHz) to record spectral-resolved dynamics of microdevices
in the frequency domain. The measurable frequency range can be extended up to
MHz or even GHz level by a high-speed circuit model. We believe the system
together with the analytical signal processing can be beneficial for
next-generation thermal infrared material and device exploration, boosting the
applications in lighting, sensing, imaging, and energy harvesting on a small

Thus, the neoplastic process, understood here as a biological phenomenon with
profound embryologic implications, served as the evolutionary engine that
favored the formation of the first embryo and cancerous diseases and allowed to
coherently create and recreate body shapes in different animal groups during
evolution. In this article, we provide a deep reflection on the Physics of the
first embryogenesis and its contribution to the exaptation of additional NFM
components, such as the extracellular matrix. Knowledge of NFM components,
structure, dynamics, and origin advances our understanding of the numerous
possibilities and different innovations that embryos have undergone to create

pathways of Neoplasia have their origins in ctenophores and were consolidated

privacy guarantees. Secure inference has emerged as a potential solution,
wherein cryptographic primitives allow inference without revealing users'
inputs to a model provider or model's weights to a user. For instance, the
model provider could be a diagnostics company that has trained a
state-of-the-art DenseNet-121 model for interpreting a chest X-ray and the user
could be a patient at a hospital. While secure inference is in principle
feasible for this setting, there are no existing techniques that make it
practical at scale. The CrypTFlow2 framework provides a potential solution with
its ability to automatically and correctly translate clear-text inference to
secure inference for arbitrary models. However, the resultant secure inference
from CrypTFlow2 is impractically expensive: Almost 3TB of communication is
required to interpret a single X-ray on DenseNet-121. In this paper, we address
this outstanding challenge of inefficiency of secure inference with three
contributions. First, we show that the primary bottlenecks in secure inference
are large linear layers which can be optimized with the choice of network
backbone and the use of operators developed for efficient clear-text inference.
This finding and emphasis deviates from many recent works which focus on
optimizing non-linear activation layers when performing secure inference of
smaller networks. Second, based on analysis of a bottle-necked convolution
layer, we design a X-operator which is a more efficient drop-in replacement.
Third, we show that the fast Winograd convolution algorithm further improves
efficiency of secure inference. In combination, these three optimizations prove
to be highly effective for the problem of X-ray interpretation trained on the
CheXpert dataset.

critical challenge for the development of richer and more complex game worlds

achieving that long-standing goal is the use of generative AI agents, namely
procedural personas, that attempt to imitate particular playing behaviors which
are represented as rules, rewards, or human demonstrations. All research
efforts for building those generative agents, however, have focused solely on
playing behavior which is arguably a narrow perspective of what a player
actually does in a game. Motivated by this gap in the existing state of the
art, in this paper we extend the notion of behavioral procedural personas to
cater for player experience, thus examining generative agents that can both
behave and experience their game as humans would. For that purpose, we employ
the Go-Explore reinforcement learning paradigm for training human-like
procedural personas, and we test our method on behavior and experience
demonstrations of more than 100 players of a racing game. Our findings suggest
that the generated agents exhibit distinctive play styles and experience
responses of the human personas they were designed to imitate. Importantly, it
also appears that experience, which is tied to playing behavior, can be a
highly informative driver for better behavioral exploration.

in everyday financial transactions. One of these countries, Ethiopia, is
believed to have one of the world highest rates of blindness (1.6%) and low
vision (3.7%). There are around 4 million visually impaired people; With 1.7
million people being in complete vision loss. Those people face a number of
challenges when they are in a bus station, in shopping centers, or anywhere
which requires the physical exchange of money. In this paper, we try to provide
a solution to this issue using AI/ML applications. We developed an Android and
IOS compatible mobile application with a model that achieved 98.9%
classification accuracy on our dataset. The application has a voice integrated
feature that tells the type of the scanned currency in Amharic, the working
language of Ethiopia. The application is developed to be easily accessible by
its users. It is build to reduce the burden of visually impaired people in
Ethiopia.

  compression",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In recent decades, digital image processing has gained enormous popularity.
Consequently, a number of data compression strategies have been put forth, with
the goal of minimizing the amount of information required to represent images.
Among them, JPEG compression is one of the most popular methods that has been
widely applied in multimedia and digital applications. The periodic nature of
DFT makes it impossible to meet the periodic condition of an image's opposing
edges without producing severe artifacts, which lowers the image's perceptual
visual quality. On the other hand, deep learning has recently achieved
outstanding results for applications like speech recognition, image reduction,
and natural language processing. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have
received more attention than most other types of deep neural networks. The use
of convolution in feature extraction results in a less redundant feature map
and a smaller dataset, both of which are crucial for image compression. In this
work, an effective image compression method is purposed using autoencoders. The
study's findings revealed a number of important trends that suggested better
reconstruction along with good compression can be achieved using autoencoders.

  Classical Machine Learning",,,,,"eess.SP cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) aims at energy consumption and appliance
state information retrieval from aggregated consumption measurements, with the
help of signal processing and machine learning algorithms. Representation
learning with deep neural networks is successfully applied to several related
disciplines. The main advantage of representation learning lies in replacing an
expert-driven, hand-crafted feature extraction with hierarchical learning from
many representations in raw data format. In this paper, we show how the NILM
processing-chain can be improved, reduced in complexity and alternatively
designed with recent deep learning algorithms. On the basis of an event-based
appliance recognition approach, we evaluate seven different classification
models: a classical machine learning approach that is based on a hand-crafted
feature extraction, three different deep neural network architectures for
automated feature extraction on raw waveform data, as well as three baseline
approaches for raw data processing. We evaluate all approaches on two
large-scale energy consumption datasets with more than 50,000 events of 44
appliances. We show that with the use of deep learning, we are able to reach
and surpass the performance of the state-of-the-art classical machine learning
approach for appliance recognition with an F-Score of 0.75 and 0.86 compared to
0.69 and 0.87 of the classical approach.

memory, and behavior. Similarly, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43
encephalopathy (LATE) is a recently defined common neurodegenerative disease
that mimics the clinical symptoms of AD. At present, the risk factors
implicated in LATE and those distinguishing LATE from AD are largely unknown.
We leveraged an integrated feature selection-based algorithmic approach, to
identify important factors differentiating subjects with LATE and/or AD from
Control on significantly imbalanced data. We analyzed two datasets ROSMAP and
NACC and discovered that alcohol consumption was a top lifestyle and
environmental factor linked with LATE and AD and their associations were
differential. In particular, we identified a specific subpopulation consisting
of APOE e4 carriers. We found that, for this subpopulation, light-to-moderate
alcohol intake was a protective factor against both AD and LATE, but its
protective role against AD appeared stronger than LATE. The codes for our
algorithms are available at https://github.com/xinxingwu-uk/PFV.

between August 2011 and 2019. The MHD parameters of He++ ions (the bulk
velocity Va, temperature Ta, absolute density Na, and helium abundance Na/Np)
are analyzed for 20 interplanetary shocks and compared with similar parameters
for 25 Earth's bow shock crossings. Measurements from the WIND, Cluster and
THEMIS satellites were also analyzed. The correlations in the changes in helium
abundance Na/Np with the parameters {\beta}_{i}, {\theta}_{Bn} and M_{ms} were
investigated. A correlation between Na/Np and the angle {\theta}_{Bn} was
found: the lower the value of {\theta}_{Bn}, the greater the drop in helium
abundance Na/Np falls behind the IP shock front. For Earth's bow shock
crossings, we found a significant increase in the helium abundance Na/Np in
quasi-perpendicular events.

to make LMs as KBs more in line with the actual application scenarios of the
biomedical domain, we specifically add EHR notes as context to the prompt to
improve the low bound in the biomedical domain. We design and validate a series
of experiments for our Dynamic-Context-BioLAMA task. Our experiments show that
the knowledge possessed by those language models can distinguish the correct
knowledge from the noise knowledge in the EHR notes, and such distinguishing

arXiv:2004.11967 introduced a Continual Few-shot Learning framework, CFSL, that
combines both. In this study, we extended CFSL to make it more comparable to
standard continual learning experiments, where usually a much larger number of
classes are presented. We also introduced an `instance test' to classify very
similar specific instances - a capability of animal cognition that is usually
neglected in ML. We selected representative baseline models from the original
CFSL work and compared to a model with Hippocampal-inspired replay, as the
Hippocampus is considered to be vital to this type of learning in animals. As
expected, learning more classes is more difficult than the original CFSL
experiments, and interestingly, the way in which they are presented makes a
difference to performance. Accuracy in the instance test is comparable to the
classification tasks. The use of replay for consolidation improves performance
substantially for both types of tasks, particularly the instance test.

exactly why. The aim of this publication is to develop a model of the resting
spontaneous breathing rate using physiological, physical and mathematical
methods with the aid of the principle that evolution pushes physiology in a
direction that is as economical as possible. The respiratory rate then follows
from an equation with the parameters CO2-production rate of the organism,
resistance, static compliance and dead space of the lungs, the inspiration
duration: expiration duration - ratio and the end-expiratory CO2 fraction. The
derivation requires exclusively secondary school mathematics. Using the example
of an adult human or a newborn child, data from the literature then result in
normal values for their breathing rate at rest. The reason for the higher
respiratory rate of a newborn human compared to an adult is the relatively high
CO2-production rate together with the comparatively low compliance of the
lungs. A side result is the fact that the common alveolar pressure throughout
the lungs and the common time constant is a consequence of the economical
principle as well. Since the above parameters are not human-specific, there is
no reason to assume that the above equation could not also be applicable to
many animals breathing through lungs within a thorax, especially mammals. Not
only physiology and biology, but also medicine, could benefit: Applicability is
being discussed in pulmonary function diagnostics, including pathophysiology.
However, the present publication only claims to be a theoretical concept for
the spontaneous quiet breathing rate. In the absence of comparable animal data,
this publication is intended to encourage further scientific tests.
