European Space Agency and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. SMILE aims to study
the solar wind coupling with the terrestrial magnetosphere in a very novel and
global way, by imaging the Earth's magnetosheath and cusps in X-rays emitted
when high charge-state solar wind ions exchange charges with exospheric
neutrals. SMILE combines this with simultaneous UV imaging of the northern
aurora and in-situ plasma and magnetic field measurements of the magnetosheath
and solar wind while flying in a highly elliptical northern polar orbit. In
this chapter, after a brief introduction to the science that SMILE is targeted
to investigate, the payload and the spacecraft, and progress in their
development, are described. The mission operations in space, the ground segment
and the scientific preparations that will ensure the optimal exploitation of
SMILE measurements are also presented. The international space plasma and
planetary communities are looking forward to the step change that SMILE will
provide by making visible our invisible terrestrial magnetosphere.

  The 15th Conference on Web and Internet Economics (WINE 2019)",,,,"econ.TH cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a persuasion problem between a sender and a receiver whose
utility may be nonlinear in her belief; we call such receivers risk-conscious.
Such utility models arise when the receiver exhibits systematic biases away
from expected-utility-maximization, such as uncertainty aversion (e.g., from
sensitivity to the variance of the waiting time for a service). Due to this
nonlinearity, the standard approach to finding the optimal persuasion mechanism
using revelation principle fails. To overcome this difficulty, we use the
underlying geometry of the problem to develop a convex optimization framework
to find the optimal persuasion mechanism. We define the notion of full
persuasion and use our framework to characterize conditions under which full
persuasion can be achieved. We use our approach to study binary persuasion,
where the receiver has two actions and the sender strictly prefers one of them
at every state. Under a convexity assumption, we show that the binary
persuasion problem reduces to a linear program, and establish a canonical set
of signals where each signal either reveals the state or induces in the
receiver uncertainty between two states. Finally, we discuss the broader
applicability of our methods to more general contexts, and illustrate our
methodology by studying information sharing of waiting times in service
systems.

with attractive interactions, we study theoretically the few-to-many particle
crossover of pair excitations, which for large particle numbers evolve into
modes describing amplitude fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter (the

captures interactions between time-reversed fermion pairs. The model is
integrable, which allows a systematic quantitative study of the few-to-many
particle crossover with only minor numerical effort. We first establish a
parity effect in the ground state energy, which is quantified by a so-called
Matveev-Larkin parameter that generalizes the pairing gap to mesoscopic
ensembles and which behaves quantitatively differently in a few-body and a
many-body regime. The crossover point for this quantity is widely tunable as a
function of interaction strength. We then compute the excitation spectrum and
demonstrate that the pair excitation energy shows a minimum that deepens with
increasing particle number and shifts to smaller interaction strengths,
consistent with the finite-size precursor of a quantum phase transition to a
superfluid state. We extract a critical finite-size scaling exponent that
characterizes the decrease of the gap with increasing particle number.

  Generation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Scene Graph Generation (SGG) task aims to detect all the objects and
their pairwise visual relationships in a given image. Although SGG has achieved
remarkable progress over the last few years, almost all existing SGG models
follow the same training paradigm: they treat both object and predicate
classification in SGG as a single-label classification problem, and the
ground-truths are one-hot target labels. However, this prevalent training
paradigm has overlooked two characteristics of current SGG datasets: 1) For
positive samples, some specific subject-object instances may have multiple
reasonable predicates. 2) For negative samples, there are numerous missing
annotations. Regardless of the two characteristics, SGG models are easy to be
confused and make wrong predictions. To this end, we propose a novel
model-agnostic Label Semantic Knowledge Distillation (LS-KD) for unbiased SGG.
Specifically, LS-KD dynamically generates a soft label for each subject-object
instance by fusing a predicted Label Semantic Distribution (LSD) with its
original one-hot target label. LSD reflects the correlations between this
instance and multiple predicate categories. Meanwhile, we propose two different
strategies to predict LSD: iterative self-KD and synchronous self-KD. Extensive
ablations and results on three SGG tasks have attested to the superiority and
generality of our proposed LS-KD, which can consistently achieve decent
trade-off performance between different predicate categories.

images of astonishing quality. StyleGANs allow for compelling attribute
modification on such images via mathematical operations on the latent style
vectors in the W/W+ space that effectively modulate the rich hierarchical
representations of the generator. Such operations have recently been
generalized beyond mere attribute swapping in the original StyleGAN paper to
include interpolations. In spite of many significant improvements in StyleGANs,
they are still seen to generate unnatural images. The quality of the generated
images is predicated on two assumptions; (a) The richness of the hierarchical
representations learnt by the generator, and, (b) The linearity and smoothness
of the style spaces. In this work, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic
Regularizer (HSR) which aligns the hierarchical representations learnt by the
generator to corresponding powerful features learnt by pretrained networks on
large amounts of data. HSR is shown to not only improve generator
representations but also the linearity and smoothness of the latent style
spaces, leading to the generation of more natural-looking style-edited images.
To demonstrate improved linearity, we propose a novel metric - Attribute
Linearity Score (ALS). A significant reduction in the generation of unnatural
images is corroborated by improvement in the Perceptual Path Length (PPL)
metric by 16.19% averaged across different standard datasets while
simultaneously improving the linearity of attribute-change in the attribute

  Transfer","Accepted at ECCV 2022; Project Page at http://cscct.github.io/",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In class-incremental learning, the model is expected to learn new classes
continually while maintaining knowledge on previous classes. The challenge here
lies in preserving the model's ability to effectively represent prior classes
in the feature space, while adapting it to represent incoming new classes. We
propose two distillation-based objectives for class incremental learning that
leverage the structure of the feature space to maintain accuracy on previous
classes, as well as enable learning the new classes. In our first objective,
termed cross-space clustering (CSC), we propose to use the feature space
structure of the previous model to characterize directions of optimization that
maximally preserve the class: directions that all instances of a specific class
should collectively optimize towards, and those that they should collectively
optimize away from. Apart from minimizing forgetting, this indirectly
encourages the model to cluster all instances of a class in the current feature
space, and gives rise to a sense of herd-immunity, allowing all samples of a
class to jointly combat the model from forgetting the class. Our second
objective termed controlled transfer (CT) tackles incremental learning from an
understudied perspective of inter-class transfer. CT explicitly approximates
and conditions the current model on the semantic similarities between
incrementally arriving classes and prior classes. This allows the model to
learn classes in such a way that it maximizes positive forward transfer from
similar prior classes, thus increasing plasticity, and minimizes negative
backward transfer on dissimilar prior classes, whereby strengthening stability.
We perform extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, adding our method
(CSCCT) on top of three prominent class-incremental learning methods. We
observe consistent performance improvement on a variety of experimental
settings.

law in terms of the nucleon number. We found that the transition temperature is
higher for small systems than for large ones. It means that minimal triggering
conditions events in pp collisions require about twenty times higher energies

  detection",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the difficulty of cancer samples collection and annotation, cervical
cancer datasets usually exhibit a long-tailed data distribution. When training
a detector to detect the cancer cells in a WSI (Whole Slice Image) image
captured from the TCT (Thinprep Cytology Test) specimen, head categories (e.g.
normal cells and inflammatory cells) typically have a much larger number of
samples than tail categories (e.g. cancer cells). Most existing
state-of-the-art long-tailed learning methods in object detection focus on
category distribution statistics to solve the problem in the long-tailed
scenario without considering the ""hardness"" of each sample. To address this
problem, in this work we propose a Grad-Libra Loss that leverages the gradients
to dynamically calibrate the degree of hardness of each sample for different
categories, and re-balance the gradients of positive and negative samples. Our
loss can thus help the detector to put more emphasis on those hard samples in
both head and tail categories. Extensive experiments on a long-tailed TCT WSI
image dataset show that the mainstream detectors, e.g. RepPoints, FCOS, ATSS,
YOLOF, etc. trained using our proposed Gradient-Libra Loss, achieved much
higher (7.8%) mAP than that trained using cross-entropy classification loss.

IoT malware such as Mirai is a severe and inherent threat. We believe it is
essential to consider systems that enable us to remotely control infected
devices in order to prevent or limit malicious behaviors of infected devices.
In this paper, we design a promising candidate for such remote-control systems,
called IoT-REX (REmote-Control System for IoT devices). IoT-REX allows a
systems manager to designate an arbitrary subset of all IoT devices in the
system and every device can confirm whether or not the device itself was
designated; if so, the device executes a command given from the systems
manager. Towards realizing IoT-REX, we introduce a novel cryptographic
primitive called centralized multi-designated verifier signatures (CMDVS).
Although CMDVS works under a restricted condition compared to conventional
MDVS, it is sufficient for realizing IoT-REX. We provide an efficient CMDVS
construction from any approximate membership query structures and digital
signatures, yielding compact communication sizes and efficient verification
procedures for IoT-REX. We then discuss the feasibility of IoT-REX through
cryptographic implementation of the CMDVS construction on a Raspberry Pi. Our
promising results demonstrate that the CMDVS construction can compress
communication size to about 30% and thus its resulting IoT-REX becomes three
times faster than a trivial construction over typical low-power wide area
networks with an IoT device. It is expected that IoT-REX can control 12,000
devices within a second.

spanning ${0.5 \times 10^5 \le Re \le 4 \times 10^5}$. Results show that the
flow patterns responsible for noise generation appear from different laminar
separation bubbles, including one observed over the airfoil suction side and
another near the trailing edge, on the pressure side. For lower Reynolds
numbers, intermittent vortex dynamics on the suction side results in either
coherent structures or turbulent packets advected towards the trailing edge.
Such flow dynamics also affects the separation bubbles on the pressure side,
which become intermittent. Despite the irregular occurrence of
laminar-turbulent transition, the noise spectrum depicts a main tone with
multiple equidistant secondary tones. Increasing the Reynolds number leads to a
permanent turbulent regime on the suction side that reduces the coherence level
causing only small scale turbulent eddies to be observed. Furthermore, the
laminar separation bubble on the suction side almost vanishes while that on the
pressure side becomes more pronounced and permanent. As a consequence, the
dominant noise generation mechanism becomes the vortex shedding along the wake.

finding a roost, or mitigating the danger from predator attacks. While we do
not conceive the flock as a single cognitive agent, the moment-to-moment
decisions of individuals, influenced by their neighbors, appear as if to

identify the actions of the flock as allocation of energetic resources, and
thereby associate a cognitive cost to behavior. Our notion of cognitive cost
reflects the burden arising from rapid re-allocation of resource. Using a
recently developed natural geometric approach to kinetic energy allocation, we
map the flock behavior to a temporal signature on the standard (probability)
simplex. Given the signature of a flocking event, we calculate the cognitive
cost as a solution to an optimal control problem based on a game-theoretic

two cost measures, when applied to data on starling flocks, show a consistent
spread in value across events, and we suggest the possibility that higher cost

investigates the introduction of angular selective thermal emission through

the eMBB users over a time slot while guaranteeing the quality-of-service (QoS)
of each URLLC user in each mini-slot. An iterative algorithm based on
alternating optimization (AO) is proposed to find a high-quality suboptimal
solution. As a case study, the proposed algorithm is applied in an industrial
indoor environment modelled via the Quadriga channel simulator. Our simulation
results show that the proposed algorithm design enables the coexistence of eMBB
and URLLC users and yields large performance gains compared to three baseline
schemes. Furthermore, our simulation results reveal that the proposed two-time
scale resource allocation design incurs only a small performance loss compared
to the case when the IRSs are optimized in each mini-slot.

hardware accelerators, several approaches have been proposed, mainly borrowed
from the methodologies devised for cryptographic implementations. Therefore, as
expected, the same challenges posed by the complex design of such
countermeasures should be dealt with. This is despite the fact that fundamental
cryptographic approaches, specifically secure and private function evaluation,
could potentially improve the robustness against side-channel leakage. To
examine this and weigh the costs and benefits, we introduce hardware garbled NN
(HWGN2), a DL hardware accelerator implemented on FPGA. HWGN2 also provides NN
designers with the flexibility to protect their IP in real-time applications,
where hardware resources are heavily constrained, through a
hardware-communication cost trade-off. Concretely, we apply garbled circuits,
implemented using a MIPS architecture that achieves up to 62.5x fewer logical

price of communication overhead. Further, the side-channel resiliency of HWGN2
is demonstrated by employing the test vector leakage assessment (TVLA) test
against both power and electromagnetic side-channels. This is in addition to
the inherent feature of HWGN2: it ensures the privacy of users' input,
including the architecture of NNs. We also demonstrate a natural extension to

FL requires fully-labeled data for training, which is very expensive to obtain.
Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) can learn from unlabeled data for
pre-training, followed by fine-tuning with limited annotations. However, when
adopting CL in FL, the limited data diversity on each site makes federated
contrastive learning (FCL) ineffective. In this work, we propose two federated
self-supervised learning frameworks for volumetric medical image segmentation
with limited annotations. The first one features high accuracy and fits
high-performance servers with high-speed connections. The second one features
lower communication costs, suitable for mobile devices. In the first framework,
features are exchanged during FCL to provide diverse contrastive data to each
site for effective local CL while keeping raw data private. Global structural
matching aligns local and remote features for a unified feature space among
different sites. In the second framework, to reduce the communication cost for
feature exchanging, we propose an optimized method FCLOpt that does not rely on

the predictive target network update (PTNU) that predicts the parameters of the

unpredictable or predictable showing a repeated pattern either escalating to an
extreme or constantly oscillating. We consider that predictable cumulative
sequences represent unstable collective decisions of communities either
extremizing or internally conflicting, while unpredictable cumulative sequences
show stable changes. We analyze the effects of network topology and trait
distribution on the probability of cumulative sequences being predictable,
escalating and oscillating by simulations. Our findings include that unstable
collective decisions are more probable as network density increases, that
centralized networks are more likely to have unstable collective decisions and
that networks with excessively clustered or scattered conformists and rebels
tend to produce unstable cumulative sequences. We discuss the potential of the

independent probability of being true. If a strategy for solving the problem is
adaptive in the sense that its next test can depend on the outcomes of previous
tests, it has lower expected cost but may take up to exponential space to

Cross-Skeleton Node-level Interaction module (CS-NLI) is used to model

variable. This is most prominently exemplified by the Crab nebula which can
undergo both rapid brightenings and dimmings. Two pulsars in the Large
Magellanic Cloud, PSR J0540-6919 and PSR J0537-6910 are evolutionally very
close to Crab, so one may expect the same kind of variability from the PWNe
around them as from the Crab nebula. In this work we search for variability in
these PWNe in gamma rays using the data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope in
the range 100 MeV-10 GeV collected from August 2008 to December 2021. We
construct light curves of these sources in the three bands, 100-300 MeV,
300-1000 MeV and 1-10 GeV with the one week time resolution. We find evidence
of flaring activity in all the bands, in contrast with Crab, where no flares at
$E>1$ GeV were observed. Analysis of the flaring episode in the 100-300 and
300-1000 MeV bands indicates that the flux of one of the PWNe could grew by a
factor of $\approx 5-10$. We are not confident about which of the two PWNe
flared because of their proximity in the sky. However, in the 1-10 GeV band
where the angular resolution of the LAT is better, we find several episodes of
enhanced brightness in both the PWNe. We check possible contaminants which
could be responsible for the observed variability, but find their contribution
not to be relevant.

spatial and temporal patterns of surgical instruments and their interactions.
In addition, we design a multi-horizon learning strategy to balance the

significantly improves the model performance in anticipation with various

recent years due to the small-scale challenges of the vanilla Lambda cold dark
matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model and the lack of any experimental
evidence for any candidate particle. In this study, we use cosmological
$N$-body simulations to investigate high-redshift dark matter halos and their
responsiveness to an FDM-like power spectrum cutoff on small scales in the
primordial density perturbations. We study halo density profiles, shapes and
alignments in FDM-like cosmologies (the latter two for the first time) by
providing fits and quantifying departures from $\Lambda$CDM as a function of
the particle mass $m$. Compared to $\Lambda$CDM, the concentrations of FDM-like
halos are lower, peaking at an $m$-dependent halo mass and thus breaking the
approximate universality of density profiles in $\Lambda$CDM. The
intermediate-to-major and minor-to-major shape parameter profiles are
monotonically increasing with ellipsoidal radius in $N$-body simulations of
$\Lambda$CDM. In FDM-like cosmologies, the monotonicity is broken, halos are
more elongated around the virial radius than their $\Lambda$CDM counterparts
and less elongated closer to the center. Finally, intrinsic alignment
correlations, stemming from the deformation of initially spherically collapsing
halos in an ambient gravitational tidal field, become stronger with decreasing
$m$. At $z\sim 4$, we find a $6.4 \sigma$-significance in the fractional
differences between the isotropised linear alignment magnitudes
$D_{\text{iso}}$ in the $m=10^{-22}$ eV model and $\Lambda$CDM. Such FDM-like
imprints on the internal properties of virialised halos are expected to be

underlying mechanism for synthesizing information from multiple visualizations

four experiments (N = 1166) in which participants synthesized empirical
evidence from a pair of line charts presented sequentially. In Experiment 1, we
administered a baseline condition with charts depicting no specific context
where participants held no strong belief. To test for the generalizability, we
introduced real-world scenarios to our visualizations in Experiment 2, and
added accompanying text descriptions similar to on-line news articles or blog

direction and magnitude of line slopes within the chart pairs. We found that
participants tended to weigh the positive slope more when the two charts
depicted relationships in the opposite direction (e.g., one positive slope and
one negative slope). Participants tended to weigh the less steep slope when the
two charts depicted relationships in the same direction (e.g., both positive).
Through these experiments, we characterize participants' synthesis behaviors
depending on the relationship between the information they viewed, contribute
to theories describing underlying cognitive mechanisms in information

laws are limited turbulence strengths with Rytov numbers of 7 when the

possible to simulate volume turbulence strength out to Rytov numbers of 12 for

Also, that if turbulence strength is fixed, the relationship between
scintillation index and power-law depends on the operating regime. In weak

turbulence. This work also emphasizes the importance of properly scaling
turbulence strength with comparing results with different power-laws and the

of bubble structures in the nuclei has been performed in the framework of
covariant density functional theory. The main emphasis of this study is on the
role of single-particle degrees of freedom and Coulomb interaction. In general,
the formation of bubbles lowers the Coulomb energy. However, in nuclei this
trend is counteracted by the quantum nature of the single-particle states: only
specific single-particle states with specific density profiles can be occupied
with increasing proton and neutron numbers. A significant role of central
classically forbidden region at the bottom of the wine bottle potentials in the
formation of nuclear bubbles (via primarily the reduction of the densities of
the $s$ states at $r=0$) has been revealed for the first time. Their formation
also depends on the availability of low-$l$ single-particle states for
occupation since single-particle densities represent the basic building blocks
of total densities. Nucleonic potentials disfavor the occupation of such states
in hyperheavy nuclei and this contributes to the formation of bubbles in such
nuclei. Additivity rule for densities has been proposed for the first time. It
was shown that the differences in the densities of bubble and flat density
nuclei follow this rule in the $A\approx 40$ mass region and in superheavy
nuclei with comparable accuracy. This strongly suggests the same mechanism of
the formation of central depression in bubble nuclei of these two mass regions.
Nuclear saturation mechanisms and self-consistency effects also affect the
formation of bubble structures. The detailed analysis of different aspects of
bubble physics strongly suggests that the formation of bubble structures in
superheavy nuclei is dominated by single-particle effects.

algorithms in social settings. In this work, we consider the celebrated
definition of counterfactual fairness [Kusner et al., NeurIPS, 2017]. We begin
by showing that an algorithm which satisfies counterfactual fairness also
satisfies demographic parity, a far simpler fairness constraint. Similarly, we
show that all algorithms satisfying demographic parity can be trivially
modified to satisfy counterfactual fairness. Together, our results indicate
that counterfactual fairness is basically equivalent to demographic parity,
which has important implications for the growing body of work on counterfactual
fairness. We then validate our theoretical findings empirically, analyzing
three existing algorithms for counterfactual fairness against three simple
benchmarks. We find that two simple benchmark algorithms outperform all three
existing algorithms -- in terms of fairness, accuracy, and efficiency -- on
several data sets. Our analysis leads us to formalize a concrete fairness goal:
to preserve the order of individuals within protected groups. We believe
transparency around the ordering of individuals within protected groups makes
fair algorithms more trustworthy. By design, the two simple benchmark
algorithms satisfy this goal while the existing algorithms for counterfactual
fairness do not.

simultaneously have all the properties one might be interested in; for example,
being able to calculate limits of sequences is constructively incompatible with
deciding extensional equality. Using homotopy type theory as the foundational

collection of desirable properties and constructions. We then study and compare
three concrete implementations of ordinals in homotopy type theory: first, a
notation system based on Cantor normal forms (binary trees); second, a refined
version of Brouwer trees (infinitely-branching trees); and third, extensional
well-founded orders.
  Each of our three formulations has the central properties expected of
ordinals, such as being equipped with an extensional and well-founded ordering
as well as allowing basic arithmetic operations, but they differ with respect
to what they make possible in addition. For example, for finite collections of
ordinals, Cantor normal forms have decidable properties, but suprema of
infinite collections cannot be computed. In contrast, extensional well-founded
orders work well with infinite collections, but almost all properties are
undecidable. Brouwer trees take the sweet spot in the middle by combining a
restricted form of decidability with the ability to work with infinite
increasing sequences.
  Our three approaches are connected by canonical order-preserving functions
from the ""more decidable"" to the ""less decidable"" notions. We have formalised
the results on Cantor normal forms and Brouwer trees in cubical Agda, while
extensional well-founded orders have been studied and formalised thoroughly by

  implications for bar-dark matter halo dynamical friction","Accepted version, to appear in ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.GA physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The secular evolution of disk galaxies is largely driven by resonances
between the orbits of 'particles' (stars or dark matter) and the rotation of
non-axisymmetric features (spiral arms or a bar). Such resonances may also
explain kinematic and photometric features observed in the Milky Way and
external galaxies. In simplified cases, these resonant interactions are well
understood: for instance, the dynamics of a test particle trapped near a
resonance of a steadily rotating bar is easily analyzed using the angle-action
tools pioneered by Binney, Monari and others. However, such treatments do not
address the stochasticity and messiness inherent to real galaxies - effects
which have, with few exceptions, been previously explored only with complex
N-body simulations. In this paper, we propose a simple kinetic equation
describing the distribution function of particles near an orbital resonance
with a rigidly rotating bar, allowing for diffusion of the particles' slow
actions. We solve this equation for various values of the dimensionless
diffusion strength $\Delta$, and then apply our theory to the calculation of
bar-halo dynamical friction. For $\Delta = 0$ we recover the classic result of
Tremaine & Weinberg that friction ultimately vanishes, owing to the
phase-mixing of resonant orbits. However, for $\Delta > 0$ we find that
diffusion suppresses phase-mixing, leading to a finite torque. Our results
suggest that stochasticity - be it physical or numerical - tends to increase
bar-halo friction, and that bars in cosmological simulations might experience
significant artificial slowdown, even if the numerical two-body relaxation time
is much longer than a Hubble time.

learning techniques, which it is also very difficult and time-consuming
requiring huge engineering efforts. We designed and implemented DeepTLS, a
system which extracts full spectrum of features from pcaps across meta,
statistical, SPLT, byte distribution, TLS header and certificates. The backend
is written in C++ to achieve high performance, which can analyze a GB-size pcap
in a few minutes. DeepTLS was thoroughly evaluated against two state-of-the-art
tools Joy and Zeek with four well-known malicious traffic datasets consisted of
160 pcaps. Evaluation results show DeepTLS has advantage of analyzing large
pcaps with half analysis time, and identified more certificates with acceptable
performance loss compared with Joy. DeepTLS can significantly accelerate
machine learning pipeline by reducing feature extraction time from hours even
days to minutes. The system is online at https://deeptls.com, where test
artifacts can be viewed and validated. In addition, two open source tools
Pysharkfeat and Tlsfeatmark are also released.

minimal liner codes are constructed from vectorial Boolean functions. Compared
with other known ones, in general the minimal liner codes obtained in this

combines two photons of a given frequency into a third photon at twice the
frequency. Due to the symmetry constraints, it is widely used as a sensitive
probe to detect broken inversion symmetry and local polar order. Analytical
modeling of the electric-dipole SHG response is essential to extract
fundamental properties of materials from experiments. However, complexity
builds up dramatically in the analytical model when the probed crystal is of a
low bulk crystal symmetry, with a low-symmetry surface orientation, exhibits
absorption and dispersion, and consists of multiple interfaces. As a result,
there is a largely uneven landscape in the literature on the SHG modeling of
new materials, involving numerous approximations and a wide range of
(in)accuracies, leading to a rather scattered dataset of reported SHG nonlinear
susceptibility. Towards streamlining the reliability and accuracy of this
process, we have developed an open-source package called the Second Harmonic
Analysis of Anisotropic Rotational Polarimetry (SHAARP) which derives
analytical solutions and performs numerical simulations of reflection SHG from
a single interface for homogeneous crystals. Five key generalizations in SHG
modeling are implemented, including all crystal symmetries down to triclinic,
any crystal orientation, complex dielectric tensor (refractive indices) with
frequency dispersion, and general polarization states of the light. SHAARP
enables accurate anisotropic modeling of SHG response for a broad range of

usually estimated based on Wikipedia. However, for newly emerging entities
(EEs) which have just been discovered in news, they may still not be included
in Wikipedia yet. As a consequence, it is unable to obtain required EL features
for those EEs from Wikipedia and EL models will always fail to link ambiguous
mentions with those EEs correctly as the absence of their EL features. To deal
with this problem, in this paper we focus on a new task of learning EL features
for emerging entities in a general way. We propose a novel approach called
STAMO to learn high-quality EL features for EEs automatically, which needs just
a small number of labeled documents for each EE collected from the Web, as it
could further leverage the knowledge hidden in the unlabeled data. STAMO is
mainly based on self-training, which makes it flexibly integrated with any EL
feature or EL model, but also makes it easily suffer from the error
reinforcement problem caused by the mislabeled data. Instead of some common
self-training strategies that try to throw the mislabeled data away explicitly,
we regard self-training as a multiple optimization process with respect to the
EL features of EEs, and propose both intra-slot and inter-slot optimizations to
alleviate the error reinforcement problem implicitly. We construct two EL
datasets involving selected EEs to evaluate the quality of obtained EL features
for EEs, and the experimental results show that our approach significantly
outperforms other baseline methods of learning EL features.

almost unbiased for obscured systems, provides the largest number of AGNs to

broad ranges of 14-150 keV luminosity {$40 < \log[L_{\rm 14-150}/({\rm

correlation between 1.3 mm (230 GHz) and 14-150 keV luminosities. Its scatter
is $\approx$ 0.36 dex, and the mm-wave emission may serve as a good proxy of
the AGN luminosity, free of dust extinction up to $N_{\rm H} \sim 10^{26}$

radiation around the X-ray corona according to past works, we also discuss
different possible origins of the mm-wave emission; AGN-related dust emission,
outflow-driven shocks, and a small-scale ($<$ 200 pc) jet. The dust emission is
unlikely to be dominant, as the mm-wave slope is generally flatter than
expected. Also, due to no increase in the mm-wave luminosity with the Eddington
ratio, a radiation-driven outflow model is possibly not the common mechanism.
Furthermore, we find independence of the mm-wave luminosity on indicators of
the inclination angle from the polar axis of the nuclear structure, which is
inconsistent with a jet model whose luminosity depends only on the angle.

attributed to bifurcations in the nonlinear dynamics. Their approach was built
upon the phenomenon of critical slowing down, i.e., slow recovery in response
to small perturbations near bifurcations. We extend their approach to detect
and localize critical transitions in nonlinear networks. By introducing the
notion of network critical slowing down, the objective of this paper is to
detect that the network is undergoing a bifurcation only by analyzing its
signatures from measurement data. We focus on two classes of widely-used
nonlinear networks: (1) Kuramoto model for the synchronization of coupled
oscillators and (2) attraction-repulsion dynamics in swarms, each of which
presents a specific type of bifurcation. Based on the phenomenon of critical
slowing down, we study the asymptotic behavior of the perturbed system away and
close to the bifurcation and leverage this fact to develop a deterministic
method to detect and identify critical transitions in nonlinear networks.
Furthermore, we study the state covariance matrix subject to a stochastic noise
process away and close to the bifurcation and use it to develop a stochastic
framework for detecting critical transitions. Our simulation results show the
strengths and limitations of the methods.

Considering this state is very close to the $\Xi_c^0\bar{D}^0$ and $\Xi_c^+D^-$

with emphasis on the effect of its coupling to the double thresholds
$\Xi_c^0\bar{D}^0$ and $\Xi_c^+D^-$. We first use a qualitative picture based
on the ``uniformization"" of the Riemann surface of the two-channel system to
understand the positions of the enhancement. Then we use the Lippmann-Schwinger
equation (LSE) formalism (equivalent to the $K$-matrix parameterization) with
two models, the zero-range model and Flatt\'e model to investigate the $J/\psi
\Lambda$ lineshapes. Our results show that the nominal peak of the $P_{\psi
s}^\Lambda(4338)^0$ could arise either from the pole well above the $\Xi_c^+
D^-$ threshold on the $(-,+)$ sheet or from the pole well below the $\Xi_c^0
\bar{D}^0$ threshold on the $(-,-)$ sheet in the two-channel system. Using the
Breit-Wigner distribution to depict the above two lineshapes could be
misleading. We also find a novel type of lineshapes with the enhancement
constrained by the threshold difference. We urge the LHCb collaboration to
perform the refined experimental analysis considering the unitarity and
analyticity, e.g. using the K-matrix parameterization. As a by-product, we
obtain that the ratio of the isospin violating decay ${\Gamma_{P_{\psi

independent of the size of the finite field $q$. This result implies that for a
large class of functions, certain statistical differential biases are
inevitable.

and compare candidate designs for future clinical trials. In this context,
sensitivity analyses are especially useful to assess the dependence of
important design operating characteristics (OCs) with respect to various
unknown parameters (UPs). Typical examples of OCs include the likelihood of
detecting treatment effects and the average study duration, which depend on UPs
that are not known until after the onset of the clinical study, such as the
distributions of the primary outcomes and patient profiles. Two crucial
components of sensitivity analyses are (i) the choice of a set of plausible
simulation scenarios $\{\boldsymbol{\theta}_1,...,\boldsymbol{\theta}_K\}$ and
(ii) the list of OCs of interest. We propose a new approach to choose the set
of scenarios for inclusion in design sensitivity analyses. Our approach
balances the need for simplicity and interpretability of OCs computed across
several scenarios with the need to faithfully summarize -- through simulations
-- how the OCs vary across all plausible values of the UPs. Our proposal also
supports the selection of the number of simulation scenarios to be included in
the final sensitivity analysis report. To achieve these goals, we minimize a
loss function $\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_1,...,\boldsymbol{\theta}_K)$
that formalizes whether a specific set of $K$ sensitivity scenarios

how the OCs of the trial design vary across all plausible values of the UPs.

analysis of a neural network as a reachability problem and use (i) the
$\ell_{\infty}$-norm input-output Lipschitz constant and (ii) the tight
inclusion function of the network to over-approximate its reachable sets.
First, for a given implicit neural network, we use $\ell_{\infty}$-matrix
measures to propose sufficient conditions for its well-posedness, design an
iterative algorithm to compute its fixed points, and provide upper bounds for
its $\ell_\infty$-norm input-output Lipschitz constant. Second, we introduce a
related embedded network and show that the embedded network can be used to
provide an $\ell_\infty$-norm box over-approximation of the reachable sets of
the original network. Moreover, we use the embedded network to design an
iterative algorithm for computing the upper bounds of the original system's
tight inclusion function. Third, we use the upper bounds of the Lipschitz
constants and the upper bounds of the tight inclusion functions to design two
algorithms for the training and robustness verification of implicit neural
networks. Finally, we apply our algorithms to train implicit neural networks on
the MNIST dataset and compare the robustness of our models with the models
trained via existing approaches in the literature.

a shared understanding, members must communicate how insights develop to
establish common ground among collaborators. The use of provenance to
communicate analytic sensemaking carries promise by describing the interactions
and summarizing the steps taken to reach insights. Yet, no universal guidelines
exist for communicating provenance in different settings. Our work focuses on
the presentation of provenance information and the resulting conclusions
reached and strategies used by new analysts. In an open-ended, 30-minute,
textual exploration scenario, we qualitatively compare how adding different
types of provenance information (specifically data coverage and interaction
history) affects analysts' confidence in conclusions developed, propensity to
repeat work, filtering of data, identification of relevant information, and
typical investigation strategies. We see that data coverage (i.e., what was
interacted with) provides provenance information without limiting individual

and domain shift. To this end, we present a novel generalizable medical image
segmentation method. To be specific, we design our approach as a multi-task
paradigm by combining the segmentation model with a self-supervision
domain-specific image restoration (DSIR) module for model regularization. We
also design a random amplitude mixup (RAM) module, which incorporates low-level
frequency information of different domain images to synthesize new images. To
guide our model be resistant to domain shift, we introduce a semantic
consistency loss. We demonstrate the performance of our method on two public
generalizable segmentation benchmarks in medical images, which validates our
method could achieve the state-of-the-art performance.

experimentally detectable signatures of interacting topology in finite
lattices. To this end we use Lanczos-based exact diagonalization to calculate
the single-particle spectral function in real space which generalizes the local
density of states to interacting systems. Its spatial and spectral resolution
allows for the direct investigation and identification of edge states. By
studying the non-interacting limit, we demonstrate that the topological in-gap
states on the boundary are robust against both finite-size effects as well as
random bond and onsite disorder which suggests the feasibility of simulating
the SSH model in engineered dopant arrays in silicon. While edge excitations
become zero-energy spin-like for any finite interaction strength, our analysis
of the spectral function shows that the single-particle charge excitations are
gapped out on the boundary. Despite the loss of topological protection we find
that these edge excitations are quasiparticle-like as long as they remain
within the bulk gap. Above a critical interaction strength of $U_c\approx 5 t$
these quasiparticles on the boundary loose their coherence which is explained
by the merging of edge and bulk states. This is in contrast to the many-body
edge excitations which survive the limit of strong coupling, as established in
the literature. Our findings show that for moderate repulsive interactions the
non-trivial phase of the interacting SSH model can be detected through remnant

present a machine learning approach that generates an interpretable

each parameter is responsible for a unique generative factor and is insensitive
to the ones encoded by the other parameters. To that end, we resort to a
$\beta$-Variational AutoEncoder ($\beta$-VAE), a specific architecture of Deep

upon downstream of the system for interpretation purposes compared to most

hinders their potential applications on mobile devices as well as many
real-world problems. To bridge the accuracy gap between lightweight and large

improve the accuracy but adds little computation is proposed. Inspired by the
fact that depth quality is a key factor influencing the accuracy, we propose an
efficient depth quality-inspired feature manipulation (DQFM) process, which can
dynamically filter depth features according to depth quality. The proposed DQFM
resorts to the alignment of low-level RGB and depth features, as well as
holistic attention of the depth stream to explicitly control and enhance
cross-modal fusion. We embed DQFM to obtain an efficient lightweight RGB-D SOD
model called DFM-Net, where we in addition design a tailored depth backbone and
a two-stage decoder as basic parts. Extensive experimental results on nine
RGB-D datasets demonstrate that our DFM-Net outperforms recent efficient
models, running at about 20 FPS on CPU with only 8.5Mb model size, and
meanwhile being 2.9/2.4 times faster and 6.7/3.1 times smaller than the latest
best models A2dele and MobileSal. It also maintains state-of-the-art accuracy
when even compared to non-efficient models. Interestingly, further statistics

qualities without any quality labels. Last but not least, we further apply
DFM-Net to deal with video SOD (VSOD), achieving comparable performance against
recent efficient models while being 3/2.3 times faster/smaller than the prior

exchange CP-odd interquark potential induced by the Weinberg operator with

evaluating the gluonic correction to the CP-odd interquark potential in the

languages have inherent strong structural linkages, and feature mining of code
as text form would omit the structural information contained inside it. Second,
there is a potential semantic relationship between code and query, it is
challenging to align code and text across sequences so that vectors are
spatially consistent during similarity matching. To tackle both issues, in this
paper, a code search model named CSSAM (Code Semantics and Structures Attention
Matching) is proposed. By introducing semantic and structural matching
mechanisms, CSSAM effectively extracts and fuses multidimensional code
features. Specifically, the cross and residual layer was developed to
facilitate high-latitude spatial alignment of code and query at the token
level. By leveraging the residual interaction, a matching module is designed to
preserve more code semantics and descriptive features, that enhances the
adhesion between the code and its corresponding query text. Besides, to improve
the model's comprehension of the code's inherent structure, a code
representation structure named CSRG (Code Semantic Representation Graph) is
proposed for jointly representing abstract syntax tree nodes and the data flow
of the codes. According to the experimental results on two publicly available
datasets containing 540k and 330k code segments, CSSAM significantly
outperforms the baselines in terms of achieving the highest SR@1/5/10, MRR, and
NDCG@50 on both datasets respectively. Moreover, the ablation study is
conducted to quantitatively measure the impact of each key component of CSSAM

  (AISTATS) 2023",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In an unsupervised attack on variational autoencoders (VAEs), an adversary
finds a small perturbation in an input sample that significantly changes its
latent space encoding, thereby compromising the reconstruction for a fixed
decoder. A known reason for such vulnerability is the distortions in the latent
space resulting from a mismatch between approximated latent posterior and a
prior distribution. Consequently, a slight change in an input sample can move
its encoding to a low/zero density region in the latent space resulting in an
unconstrained generation. This paper demonstrates that an optimal way for an
adversary to attack VAEs is to exploit a directional bias of a stochastic
pullback metric tensor induced by the encoder and decoder networks. The
pullback metric tensor of an encoder measures the change in infinitesimal
latent volume from an input to a latent space. Thus, it can be viewed as a lens
to analyse the effect of input perturbations leading to latent space
distortions. We propose robustness evaluation scores using the eigenspectrum of
a pullback metric tensor. Moreover, we empirically show that the scores
correlate with the robustness parameter $\beta$ of the $\beta-$VAE. Since
increasing $\beta$ also degrades reconstruction quality, we demonstrate a
simple alternative using \textit{mixup} training to fill the empty regions in
the latent space, thus improving robustness with improved reconstruction.

Specifically, we derive achievable refined asymptotics under both the joint

asymptotics, we consider two types of codebooks: the spherical codebook where
each codeword is drawn independently and uniformly from the surface of a sphere

alternative achievability proof with specific code design. We show that under
JEP and SEP, the same moderate deviations constant is achievable. For large

capturing non-equilibrium dynamics of the system in which incoherently pumped
QEs have transition frequency tuned near the second-harmonic response of the
SPs. Considering the strong coupling regime, i.e., the SP-QE interaction rate
exceeds system dissipation rates, we find a critical SP-QE coupling attributed
to the phase transition between normal and lasing steady states. Examining
fluctuations above the system's steady states, we predict new elementary
excitations, namely, the exciton-plasmon polaritons formed by the two-SP quanta
and single-exciton states of QEs. The contribution of two-SP quanta results in
the linear scaling of the SP-QE interaction rate with the number of QEs, ${\cal
N}_o$, as opposed to the $\sqrt{{\cal N}_o}$-scaling known for the Dicke and
Tavis-Cummings models. We further examine how SP-QE interaction scaling affects
the polariton dispersions and power spectra in the vicinity of the critical
coupling. For this purpose, we compare the calculation results assuming a
finite ensemble of QEs and the model thermodynamic limit. The calculated power
spectra predict an interplay of coherent photon emission by QEs near the
second-harmonic frequency and correlated photon-pair emission at the
fundamental frequency by the SPs (i.e., the photonic DPDC effect).

redundant compared to the minimal realization, this sparsification collapses
unnecessary dimensions, allowing for easy removal of them. We experimentally

efficient constraint learning method to operate ADNs. This method first trains
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) based on historical data to learn the mappings
from decisions to constraint violations and power loss. Then, power flow
constraints can be replicated by these MLPs without network parameters. We
further prove that MLPs learn constraints by formulating a union of disjoint
polytopes to approximate the corresponding feasible region. Thus, the proposed
method can be interpreted as a piecewise linearization method, which also
explains its desirable ability to replicate complex constraints. Finally, a
two-step simplification method is developed to reduce its computational burden.
The first step prunes away unnecessary polytopes from the union above. The
second step drops redundant linear constraints for each retained polytope.
Numerical experiments based on the IEEE 33- and 123-bus test systems validate
that the proposed method can achieve desirable optimality and feasibility
simultaneously with guaranteed computational efficiency.

has been widely used in training neural networks. Although the optimization
problem of the neural network is non-convex, recent research has proved that
the first-order method is capable of attaining a global minimum for training
over-parameterized neural networks, where the number of parameters is
significantly larger than that of training instances. Momentum methods,
including heavy ball method (HB) and Nesterov's accelerated method (NAG), are
the workhorse first-order gradient methods owning to their accelerated
convergence. In practice, NAG often exhibits better performance than HB.
However, current research fails to distinguish their convergence difference in
training neural networks. Motivated by this, we provide convergence analysis of
HB and NAG in training an over-parameterized two-layer neural network with ReLU
activation, through the lens of high-resolution dynamical systems and neural
tangent kernel (NTK) theory. Compared to existing works, our analysis not only
establishes tighter upper bounds of the convergence rate for both HB and NAG,
but also characterizes the effect of the gradient correction term, which leads
to the acceleration of NAG over HB. Finally, we validate our theoretical result
on three benchmark datasets.

adversarial method for watermarking the pre-trained encoder in contrastive

enforcing the training samples to be marked to deviate respective location and
surround a randomly selected key image in the embedding space. Then, the

uncorrelated disorders, can be easily implemented in Aharonov-Bohm circuits by
engineering the spatial distribution of ground settings. Through the direct
measurements of frequency-dependent impedance responses and time-domain voltage
dynamics, the inverse Anderson transitions induced by antisymmetric-correlated

discovered in both human and a wide range of animal species. The corruption
method destroys the gradient-defined boundaries and generates the perception of
illusory contours using line gratings abutting each other. We applied the
method on MNIST, high resolution MNIST, and silhouette object images. Various

early layers indicates that better performing models exhibit stronger
end-stopping property, which is consistent with neuroscience discoveries. To
validate the corruption method, 24 human subjects are involved to classify

halfspace depth function everywhere in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this paper we show
that despite this negative result, one can still obtain a substantial amount of
information on the support and the location of the mass of $\mu$ from its
halfspace depth. We illustrate our partial reconstruction procedure in an

promising method that uses the cosmological model-independent Cosmic

by removing the assumptions about the cosmic flatness and using a
non-parametric Artificial Neural Network for the data reconstruction process.
We observe a correlation between the cosmic curvature density parameter and the
slope of the $L-\sigma$ relation, thereby improving the reliability of the

training a simple, more interpretable model to locally approximate the decision
boundary of a non-interpretable system, we can estimate the relative importance
of the input features on the prediction. Focusing on images, surrogate
explainers, e.g., LIME, generate a local neighbourhood around a query image by
sampling in an interpretable domain. However, these interpretable domains have
traditionally been derived exclusively from the intrinsic features of the query
image, not taking into consideration the manifold of the data the
non-interpretable model has been exposed to in training (or more generally, the
manifold of real images). This leads to suboptimal surrogates trained on
potentially low probability images. We address this limitation by aligning the
local neighbourhood on which the surrogate is trained with the original
training data distribution, even when this distribution is not accessible. We
propose two approaches to do so, namely (1) altering the method for sampling
the local neighbourhood and (2) using perceptual metrics to convey some of the

running on digital computers. Here, we present an all-optical processor to
directly classify unknown objects through unknown, random phase diffusers using

diffractive layers, optimized using deep learning, forms a physical network
that all-optically maps the spatial information of an input object behind a
random diffuser into the power spectrum of the output light detected through a
single pixel at the output plane of the diffractive network. We numerically
demonstrated the accuracy of this framework using broadband radiation to
classify unknown handwritten digits through random new diffusers, never used

This single-pixel all-optical object classification system through random
diffusers is based on passive diffractive layers that process broadband input
light and can operate at any part of the electromagnetic spectrum by simply
scaling the diffractive features proportional to the wavelength range of
interest. These results have various potential applications in, e.g.,

omni-directional tethered robot workspace (namely, the set of all

distance-optimal tethered path planning algorithms that leverage the workspace
convexity. The workspace is proven to be topologically a simply-connected
subset and geometrically a convex subset of the set of all configurations. As a
direct result, the tether-length-admissible optimal path between two
configurations is proven exactly the untethered collision-free locally shortest
path in the homotopy specified by the concatenation of the tether curve of the
given configurations, which can be simply constructed by performing an
untethered path shortening process in the 2D environment instead of a path
searching process in the pre-calculated workspace.
  The convexity is an intrinsic property to the tethered robot kinematics, thus
has universal impacts on all high-level distance-optimal tethered path planning
tasks: The most time-consuming workspace pre-calculation (WP) process is
replaced with a goal configuration pre-calculation (GCP) process, and the
homotopy-aware path searching process is replaced with untethered path
shortening processes. Motivated by the workspace convexity, efficient
algorithms to solve the following problems are naturally proposed: (a) The
optimal tethered reconfiguration (TR) planning problem is solved by a locally
untethered path shortening (UPS) process, (b) The classic optimal tethered path

the target tether state is not assigned) is solved by a GCP process and $n$ UPS

We consider the IRS-assisted ISAC design in the case with Type-I or Type-II
CUs, where each Type-I and Type-II CU can and cannot cancel the interference
from sensing signals, respectively. In particular, we aim to maximize the
minimum sensing beampattern gain among multiple targets, by jointly optimizing
the BS transmit beamforming vectors and the IRS phase shifting matrix, subject
to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for each
Type-I/Type-II CU, the interference power constraint per clutter, the
transmission power constraint at the BS, and the cross-correlation pattern
constraint. Due to the coupling of the BS's transmit design variables and the
IRS's phase shifting matrix, the formulated max-min IRS-assisted ISAC design
problem in the case with Type-I/Type-II CUs is highly non-convex. As such, we
propose an efficient algorithm based on the alternating-optimization and

that the dedicated sensing signal at the BS is always beneficial to improve the

widely-accepted conjecture that the thermal chiral phase transition in QCD-like
theories with massless (light) three flavors is of first order. We find that
such a first order feature may not hold, when ordinary or dark quarks are
externally coupled to a weak enough background field of photon or dark photon
(which we collectively call a ``magnetic"" field). We assume that a weak
``magnetic"" background field could be originated from some ``magnetogenesis"" in
the early Universe. We work on a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model which can describe
the chiral phase transition in a wide class of QCD-like theories. We show that

away when $2 f_\pi^2 \lesssim eB ( \ll (4 \pi f_\pi)^2)$, where $eB$ is the
``magnetic"" field strength and $f_\pi$ the pion decay constant at the vacuum.
This disappearance is the generic consequence of the presence of the

  polynomial optimization",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we consider polynomial optimization with correlative sparsity.
For such problems, one may apply the correlative sparse sum of squares (CS-SOS)
relaxations to exploit the correlative sparsity, which produces semidefinite
programs of smaller sizes, compared with the classical moment-SOS relaxations.
The Lagrange multiplier expression (LME) is also a useful tool to construct
tight SOS relaxations for polynomial optimization problems, which leads to
convergence with a lower relaxation order. However, the correlative sparsity is
usually corrupted by the LME based reformulation. We propose a novel parametric
LME approach which inherits the original correlative sparsity pattern, that we
call correlative sparse LME (CS-LME). The reformulation using CS-LMEs can be
solved using the CS-SOS relaxation to obtain sharper lower bound and
convergence is guaranteed under mild conditions. Numerical examples are
presented to show the efficiency of our new approach.

problem of achieving high-reliability and low-latency communication in
multi-hop wireless networks. We propose a new family of
Automatic-Repeat-Requests (ARQs) based cooperative strategies wherein high
end-to-end reliability is obtained using packet re-transmissions at each hop
while the low-latency constraint is met by imposing an upper bound on the total
number of packet retransmissions across the network. A hallmark of our
strategies is the one-hop listening capability wherein nodes utilize the unused
ARQs of their preceding node just by counting the number of failed attempts due
to decoding errors. We further extend the idea of one-hop listening to
multi-hop listening, wherein a set of consecutive nodes form clusters to
utilize the unused ARQs of the preceding nodes, beyond its nearest neighbour,
to further improve reliability. Thus, our strategies provide the
high-reliability feature with no compromise in the original latency-constraint.
For the proposed strategies, we solve non-linear optimization problems on
distributing the ARQs across the nodes so as to minimize packet drop
probability (PDP) subject to a total number of ARQs in the network. Through
extensive theoretical results on PDP and delay profiles, we show that the
proposed strategies outperform the best-known strategies in this space.

systems display gamma-Cas characteristics (i.e. bright and hard X-rays), and
one of them is a new detection: HD37202 (zeta Tau). It presents an extremely

(possibly due to its high inclination). In parallel, it may be noted that the
previously reported cyclic behaviour of this Be star has disappeared in recent
years. Instead, shorter cycles and symmetric line profiles are observed for the
Halpha line. It had been recently suggested that the peculiar X-ray emissions

Be star and the wind of its hot, stripped-star companion. The small fraction of
gamma-Cas analogs in this sample, as well as the properties of the known

increase of the dynamic advancing contact angle of the lamella with surface

we show that the transition from hydrophilic to superydrophobic behaviour can

rather weak. The fact is that such flares can occur both in small and large

occur much more often in large active regions. In energy estimates, the mean
magnetic field in starspots can also be assumed equal to the mean field in the
sunspot umbra. So the effective mean magnetic field is 900 Mx/cm$^2$ in
sunspots and 2000 Mx/cm$^2$ in starspots. Moreover, the height of the energy
storage cannot be strictly proportional to A$^{1/2}$. For stars, the fitting
factor is an order of magnitude smaller. The analysis of the occurrence rate of
powerful solar X-ray flares of class M and X and superflares on stars shows
that, with allowance for the difference in the spottedness and compactness of
active regions, both sets can be described by a single model. Thus, the problem
of superflares on stars and their absence on the Sun is reduced to the problem
of difference in the effectiveness of the dynamo mechanisms.

device to discuss storytelling and transdisciplinarity in visualization. If
data is the prima materia of modern science, how does one perform the Great
Work? We use text-to-image diffusion-based generative art to develop the
concept, and structure our argument in ten propositions, as if they were ten
issues of a comic novel on data alchemy: Ad Disco Diffusionem. To follow the
argument, the reader must immerse themselves in our miro board, and navigate a
multimedia semiotic topology that includes comics, videos, code demos, and
ergotic literature in a true alchemic sense. By accessing this paradigm one
might find new sources of inspiration for scientific inquiry in familiar
places, or get lost in the creative exploration of the unknown. Our colorful,
sometimes poetic, exposition should not distract the reader from the
seriousness of the ideas discussed, but ultimately it is about the journey.

  17 Figures",,"10.1093/mnras/stac3177",,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We investigate the occurrence of rapid-rotation induced chemically
homogeneous evolution (CHE) due to strong tides and mass accretion in binaries.
To this end, we generalize the relation in Packet (1981) to calculate the
minimum angular momentum (AM) accretion required by a secondary star to
experience accretion-induced CHE. Contrary to traditionally assumed 5-10
percent accretion of initial mass ($Z \lesssim 0.004$, $M \gtrsim$ 20
M$_{\odot}$) for spinning up the accretor (resulting in CHE) this value can
drop to $\sim$ 2 percent for efficient AM accretion while for certain systems
it could be substantially larger. We conduct a population study using
\textsc{bpass} by evolving stars under the influence of strong tides in
short-period binaries and also account for the updated effect of
accretion-induced spin-up. We find accretion CHE (compared to tidal CHE) to be
the dominant means of producing homogeneous stars even at 10 percent AM
accretion efficiency during mass transfer. Unlike tidal CHE, it is seen that CH
stars arising due to accretion can retain a larger fraction of their AM till
core collapse. Thus we show that accretion CHE could be an important formation
channel for energetic electromagnetic transients like GRBs, Ic-BL (SLSN-I,
Ic-BL) under the collapsar (magnetar) formalism and a single CH star could lead
to both the transients under their respective formation scenario. Lastly, we
show that under the current treatment of CHE, the emission rate of ionizing
photons by such stars decreases more rapidly at higher metallicities than
previously predicted.

  entanglement","To be published in Physical Review D (4 figures)",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.106.045023",,"quant-ph gr-qc","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Twisted photons carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) are competent
candidates for future interstellar communications. However, the gravitational
fluctuations are ubiquitous in spacetime. Thus a fundamental question arises
naturally as to how the gravitational fluctuations affect the coherence and the
degree of high-dimensional OAM entanglement when twisted photons travel across
the textures of curved spacetime. Here, we consider the covariant scalar
Helmholtz equations and the Minkowski metric with fluctuations of Gaussian
distribution and formulate analytically the equations describing the motion for
twisted light in the Laguerre-Gaussian mode space. It is seen that the OAM
cannot remain conserved in the presence of gravitational fluctuations.
Furthermore, two-photon density matrices are derived for interstellar OAM
quantum entanglement distribution, and the degree of entanglement degradation
is characterized by purity and negativity. It is revealed that the
higher-dimensional OAM entanglement is more susceptible to spacetime
fluctuations. We believe that our findings will be of fundamental importance
for the future interstellar quantum communications with twisted photons.

decay $\Lambda_{c}^{+}\to\Lambda K^{+}$ using a data sample collected with the
BESIII detector at the BEPCII storage ring. The data span center-of-mass
energies from 4.599 to 4.950 GeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of
6.44 fb$^{-1}$. The branching fraction of $\Lambda_{c}^{+}\to\Lambda K^{+}$
relative to that of the Cabibbo-favored decay $\Lambda_{c}^{+}\to\Lambda
\pi^{+}$ is measured to be
$\mathcal{R}=\frac{\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_{c}^{+}\to\Lambda
K^{+})}{\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_{c}^{+}\to\Lambda
\pi^{+})}=(4.78\pm0.34\pm0.20)\%$. Combining with the world-average value of
$\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_{c}^{+}\to\Lambda \pi^{+})$, we obtain
$\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^+\to\Lambda K^+)=(6.21\pm0.44\pm0.26\pm0.34)\times
10^{-4}$. Here the first uncertainties are statistical, the second systematic,
and the third comes from the uncertainty of the $\Lambda_{c}^{+}\to\Lambda
\pi^{+}$ branching fraction. This result, which is more precise than previous
measurements, does not agree with theoretical predictions, and suggests that
non-factorizable contributions have been under-estimated in current models.

Scrum. It expresses a shared view of a Scrum Team on what makes an increment of
their product complete. DoDs are often defined as checklists with items being
requirements towards software (e.g., quality requirements) or towards
activities performed to make the increment shippable (e.g., code reviews,
testing). Unfortunately, the knowledge about the usefulness of DoD is still
very limited.
  Objective: The goal is to study what benefits using the DoD practice can
bring to an agile project, what problems it may trigger, and how it is created
and maintained.
  Method: In the survey among members of agile software development projects,
137 practitioners from all over the globe shared their experience with us.
  Results: 93% of the respondents perceive DoD as at least valuable for their
ventures. It helps them to make work items complete, assure product quality,
and ensure the needed activities are executed. However, they indicated that
every second project struggles with infeasible, incorrect, unavailable, or
creeping DoD.
  Conclusions: It follows from the study that DoD is important but not easy to
use and more empirical studies are needed to identify best practices in this
area.

Also, it shows its high potential in combination with optical
spectroscopy-based approaches that are under development for mobile,
ultra-fast, and low-invasive diagnostics. I will show how spectroscopy-based
approaches can reduce the time of tissue preparation for pathological analysis
by making thin-slicing or haematoxylin-and-eosin staining obsolete. I will
present examples of spectroscopic tools for fast and low-invasive ex- and
in-vivo tissue classification for the determination of a tumour and its
boundaries. Also, I will discuss that, contrary to MRI and CT, spectroscopic
measurements do not require the administration of chemical agents to enhance
the quality of cancer imaging which contributes to the development of more
secure diagnostic methods. Overall, we will see that the combination of
spectroscopy and artificial intelligence constitutes a highly promising and

steady states encounters a pattern-forming, or Turing, bifurcation. The latter
corresponds to a Hamiltonian-Hopf point of the corresponding spatial dynamics
problem. Such codimension-three points are sometimes called Lifshitz points in
the physics literature. In the simplest case where the spatial system conserves
a first integral, the system is described by a canonical fourth order scalar
system. The problem contains three small parameters, two that unfold the cusp
bifurcation and one that unfolds the Turing bifurcation. Several cases are
revealed, depending on open conditions on the signs of the lowest-order
nonlinear terms. Taking the case in which the Turing bifurcation is
subcritical, various parameter regimes are considered and the bifurcation
diagrams of localized structures are elucidated. A rich bifurcation structure
is revealed, which involves transitions between regions of localized periodic
patterns generated by homoclinic snaking, and mesa-like patterns with uniform
cores. The theory is shown to unify previous numerical results obtained in
models arising in nonlinear optics, fluid mechanics, and excitable media more
generally.

of sequential decoding of the polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes
is random. In sequential decoding of convolutional codes, the computational
cutoff rate denotes the region between rates whose average computational
complexity of decoding is finite and those which is infinite. In this paper, by
benefiting from the polarization and guessing techniques, we prove that the
computational cutoff rate in sequential decoding of pre-transformed polar codes
polarizes. The polarization of the computational cutoff rate affects the
criteria for the rate-profile construction of the pre-transformed polar codes.
We propose a technique for taming the Reed-Muller (RM) rate-profile

  by Pre-averaging",,,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Tensor time series data appears naturally in a lot of fields, including
finance and economics. As a major dimension reduction tool, similar to its
factor model counterpart, the idiosyncratic components of a tensor time series
factor model can exhibit serial correlations, especially in financial and
economic applications. This rules out a lot of state-of-the-art methods that
assume white idiosyncratic components, or even independent/Gaussian data. While
the traditional higher order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) is proved to be
convergent to a set of factor loading matrices, the closeness of them to the
true underlying factor loading matrices are in general not established, or only
under some strict circumstances like having i.i.d. Gaussian noises (Zhang and
Xia, 2018). Under the presence of serial and cross-correlations in the
idiosyncratic components and time series variables with only bounded fourth
order moments, we propose a pre-averaging method that accumulates information
from tensor fibres for better estimating all the factor loading spaces. The
estimated directions corresponding to the strongest factors are then used for
projecting the data for a potentially improved re-estimation of the factor
loading spaces themselves, with theoretical guarantees and rate of convergence
spelt out. We also propose a new rank estimation method which utilizes
correlation information from the projected data, in the same spirit as Fan, Guo
and Zheng (2022) for factor models with independent data. Extensive simulation
results reveal competitive performance of our rank and factor loading
estimators relative to other state-of-the-art or traditional alternatives. A

pure quantum state using parallel unentangled measurements. Pure states are a
small but useful subset of all quantum states, their tomography requires fewer

measure each qubit individually. We propose two sets of quantum measurements
that one can make on a pure state as well as the algorithms that use the
measurements outcomes in order to identify the state. We also discuss how those
estimates can be fined tuned by finding the state that maximizes the likelihood
of the measurements with different variants of the likelihood. The performances
of the proposed three types of QST methods are validated by means of detailed

the solution of an online algorithm is measured using a competitive ratio. No
online deterministic algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio better than

can be interpreted as additional information for the online algorithm to
compensate for the lack of information about the whole input sequence. In this
study, we investigate how introducing machine-learned advice could improve the
competitive ratio for this problem. We provide an online algorithm for the
online assignment problem by simulating a machine learning algorithm that
predicts the whole input in advance. We utilize an optimal offline algorithm to
provide a matching solution from the predicted input. Furthermore, we
investigate how the prediction error of machine learning affects the

error increases, the solution quality decreases. Moreover, the magnitude of
error is directly proportional to the size of the input. This result is
analogous to the competitive ratio of the best deterministic algorithm for the

investigates chase-combining-based hybrid automatic repeat request (CC-HARQ)
protocols to achieve high reliability in delay-constrained applications. A
salient feature of our approach is to use the end-to-end delay constraint for
computing the total number of ARQs permitted in the network, and then optimally
distributing them across the nodes so as to minimize packet-drop-probability
(PDP), which is the end-to-end reliability metric of interest. Since the
chase-combining strategy combines the received packets across multiple
attempts, we observe that the PDP of the network depends on the coherence-time
of the intermediate wireless channels. As a result, we address the question of
computing optimal allocation of ARQs for CC-HARQ strategies under both
slow-fading and fast-fading scenarios. For both the channel conditions, we
derive closed-form expressions for the PDP, and then formulate several
optimization problems for minimizing the PDP for a given delay-bound. Using
extensive theoretical results on the local minima of the optimization problems,
we synthesize low-complexity algorithms to obtain near-optimal ARQ
distributions. Besides using extensive simulation results to validate our
findings, a detailed end-to-end delay analysis is also presented to show that
the proposed CC-HARQ strategies outperform already known Type-1 ARQ based

main challenges. Firstly, modeling long-range intra-sequence dependency is
difficult with increasing sequence lengths. Secondly, it requires efficient
memory and computational speeds. In this paper, we propose a Sparse Attentive
Memory (SAM) network for long sequential user behavior modeling. SAM supports
efficient training and real-time inference for user behavior sequences with
lengths on the scale of thousands. In SAM, we model the target item as the
query and the long sequence as the knowledge database, where the former
continuously elicits relevant information from the latter. SAM simultaneously
models target-sequence dependencies and long-range intra-sequence dependencies
with O(L) complexity and O(1) number of sequential updates, which can only be
achieved by the self-attention mechanism with O(L^2) complexity. Extensive
empirical results demonstrate that our proposed solution is effective not only
in long user behavior modeling but also on short sequences modeling.
Implemented on sequences of length 1000, SAM is successfully deployed on one of
the largest international E-commerce platforms. This inference time is within

social system might behave when populated, and make adjustments to the design
before the system falls prey to such challenges? We introduce social simulacra,
a prototyping technique that generates a breadth of realistic social
interactions that may emerge when a social computing system is populated.
Social simulacra take as input the designer's description of a community's
design -- goal, rules, and member personas -- and produce as output an instance
of that design with simulated behavior, including posts, replies, and
anti-social behaviors. We demonstrate that social simulacra shift the behaviors
that they generate appropriately in response to design changes, and that they
enable exploration of ""what if?"" scenarios where community members or
moderators intervene. To power social simulacra, we contribute techniques for
prompting a large language model to generate thousands of distinct community
members and their social interactions with each other; these techniques are
enabled by the observation that large language models' training data already
includes a wide variety of positive and negative behavior on social media
platforms. In evaluations, we show that participants are often unable to
distinguish social simulacra from actual community behavior and that social

trajectory of a particle in a $d$-dimensional, spherically symmetric, quadratic
potential. The OUP is composed of a drift term weighted by a constant $\theta
\geq 0$ and a diffusion coefficient weighted by $\sigma > 0$. In the absence of
drift (i.e. $\theta = 0$), the OUP simply becomes a standard Brownian motion
(BM). This paper is concerned with estimating the mean first-exit time (MFET)
of the OUP from a ball of finite radius $L$ for large $d \gg 0$. We prove that,
asymptotically for $d \to \infty$, the OUP takes (on average) no longer to exit
than BM. In other words, the mean-reverting drift of the OUP (scaled by $\theta
\geq 0$) has asymptotically no effect on its MFET. This finding might be
surprising because, for small $d \in \mathbb{N}$, the OUP exit time is
significantly larger than BM by a margin that depends on $\theta$. As it allows
for the drift to be ignored, it might simplify the analysis of high-dimensional
exit-time problems in numerous areas.
  Finally, our short proof for the non-asymptotic MFET of OUP, using the
Andronov--Vitt--Pontryagin formula, might be of independent interest.

FePt(L10)/FeCo/CoO/FeCo multilayer (ML) has been investigated to understand the
origin of asymmetric magnetization reversal and its correlation with exchange
bias (EB). In the ML structure, the bottom FeCo layer is coupled to the hard
FePt(L10) layer, and the top FeCo layer is comparatively free due to the
relatively more distance from it. The ML has been deposited under UHV
conditions and characterized at each stage of growth using magneto-optical Kerr
effect and x-ray reflectivity techniques. Magnetization reversal is further
studied through domain imaging using the Kerr microscopy technique. The
experimental findings reveal that ML exhibits asymmetrical magnetization
reversal for a certain range of azimuthal angles for both 1.5kOe and 50kOe
saturation fields; however, this angular range of asymmetry decreases with the
increase in the saturation field. Furthermore, EB was absent at the low
saturation field, whereas, EB, in addition to asymmetry, is observed at the
large saturation field. The origin of asymmetry is attributed to
non-collinearity between magnetic anisotropy axes of both FeCo layers. It
results from the proximity effect through short-range Heisenberg exchange
interaction via the CoO barrier layer. On the other hand, EB arises due to
unidirectional anisotropy induced in the FePt layer due to the high saturation
field. It is further proposed that asymmetry would disappear when
unidirectional anisotropy is strong enough to align both the FeCo layers in the
saturation direction leading to loss of the non-collinearity between them.

algorithms, many of the modern datasets just combine different factors that
influence face recognition, such as face pose, occlusion, illumination, facial
expression and image quality. When algorithms produce errors on these datasets,
it is not clear which of the factors has caused this error and, hence, there is

total energy density includes contribution from a new scalar field apart from
the radiation energy density. The non-trivial modifications incurred in the
Boltzmann equations render the well known analytical solutions unsuitable in
non standard scenario. In the present study we derive analytical expressions
for the efficiency factor (which is nothing but solution of set of Boltzmann
equations) using certain legible approximations. A fair degree of accuracy of
these formulas have been observed by juxtaposing the analytical results with
that obtained through numerical solution of Boltzmann equations. Faster
expansion of the Universe results in decrement of the effective decay parameter
which brings down the amount of washout of asymmetry due to inverse decay. Thus
in non-standard cosmology scenario, a larger fraction of the asymmetry
(generated at early epoch) is expected to survive till present epoch.
Alteration of the cosmology does not affect the underlying particle physics
model responsible for the generation of the CP asymmetry. Therefore starting
from an identical particle physics model we will end up with a larger final
baryon asymmetry in the non-standard scenario. It hints towards the possible
relaxation of the lower bound of the lightest right handed neutrino mass
required to produce adequate asymmetry which is in agreement with current
experimental data.

describes charge fluctuations at long wavelengths in the square-lattice Hubbard
model. Due to the continuity equation, the correlation functions for the charge
and the current are directly connected: the parameters of the effective
hydrodynamic model thus determine the optical conductivity. Here we investigate
the validity of the proposed hydrodynamic theory in the full range of
parameters of the Hubbard model. In the non-interacting case, there is no
effective hydrodynamics, and the charge fluctuations present a rich variety of
non-universal behaviors. At weak coupling, the optical conductivity is
consistent with the hydrodynamic theory: at low frequency one observes a
Lorentzian-shaped Drude peak, but the high-frequency asymptotics is necessarily
different; the high-temperature limit for the product of the two hydrodynamic
model parameters is also in agreement with numerical data. At strong coupling,
we find that a generalization of the proposed hydrodynamic law is consistent
with our quantum Monte Carlo, as well as the finite-temperature Lanczos results

superseded by stronger theorems depending on the classification of the finite
simple groups, for example a classification of primitive groups of odd degree.
  However, there are further reasons for being interested in this paper. First,
it was written at a time when combinatorial techniques were being introduced
into the theory of finite permutation groups, and the paper gives a very good
summary and application of these techniques. Second, like its predecessor by
Helmut Wielandt on primitive groups of degree 2p, it can be re-interpreted as a
combinatorial result concerning association schemes whose common eigenspaces
have dimensions of a rather limited form. This result uses neither the
primality of p nor the existence of a permutation group related to the
combinatorial structure. We extract these results and give details of the
related combinatorics.

basically developed for centralized settings. In this context, the present work
puts forth a distributed stochastic Frank-Wolfe solver, by judiciously
combining Nesterov's momentum and gradient tracking techniques for stochastic

steps during pre-training have crucial impact on the performance of the
pre-trained model: in-batch hard negative sampling for image-text matching
(ITM) and assigning the large masking probability for the masked language
modeling (MLM). After empirically showing the unexpected effectiveness of above
two steps, we systematically devise our GRIT-VLP, which adaptively samples
mini-batches for more effective mining of hard negative samples for ITM while
maintaining the computational cost for pre-training. Our method consists of
three components: 1) GRouped mIni-baTch sampling (GRIT) strategy that collects
similar examples in a mini-batch, 2) ITC consistency loss for improving the
mining ability, and 3) enlarged masking probability for MLM. Consequently, we
show our GRIT-VLP achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on various
downstream tasks with much less computational cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that our model is essentially in par with ALBEF, the previous state-of-the-art,

even fail if the input data differ from the expected. This is the case for ML
models used in the Electroslag Remelting (ESR) process in the refined steel
industry to predict the pressure in a vacuum chamber. A vacuum pumping event
that occurs once a workday generates a few hundred samples in a year of pumping
for training and testing. In the absence of adequate training and test samples,
this paper first presents a method to generate a fresh set of augmented samples
based on vacuum pumping principles. Based on the generated augmented samples,
three test scenarios and one test oracle are presented to assess the robustness
of an ML model used for production on an industrial scale. Experiments are
conducted with real industrial production data obtained from Uddeholms AB steel
company. The evaluations indicate that Ensemble and Neural Network are the most
robust when trained on augmented data using the proposed testing strategy. The
evaluation also demonstrates the proposed method's effectiveness in checking

subject to breaking when material is actively being fed into the inner parts of
the disc. After breaking, the disc is composed of two rings: an inner ring that
is anchored to the stellar equator and an outer ring that is free to nodally
precess. A double ring disc may explain some of the observed variability in
Pleione. We model the nodal precession of the outer disc ring that is driven by
the companion on an observed timescale of $80.5\,\rm yr$. We find that the
outer ring of a broken disc in a binary with an eccentricity of $e_{\rm b}=

rough agreement with the observed disc size. An unbroken disc model cannot fit
both the observed precession rate and disc size. Suppression of Kozai-Lidov

selected atoms in materials, including particle-hole transitions between the
valence and conduction bands. These transitions are governed by fundamental
properties of the corresponding Bloch wave-functions, including orbital and
magnetic degrees of freedom, and quantum geometric properties such as the Berry
curvature. In particular, orbital angular momentum (OAM), which is closely
linked to the Berry curvature, can exhibit a nontrivial momentum dependence. We
demonstrate how information on such OAM textures can be extracted from the
circular dichroism in RIXS. Based on accurate modeling with first-principles
treatment of the key ingredient -- the light-matter interaction -- we simulate
dichroic RIXS spectra for the prototypical transition metal dichalcogenide
MoSe$_2$ and the two-dimensional topological insulator 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$.
Guided by an intuitive picture for the optical selection rules, we discuss how
the momentum-dependent OAM manifests itself in the dichroic RIXS signal if one
controls the momentum transfer. Our calculations are performed for typical
experimental geometries and parameter regimes, and demonstrate the possibility
of observing the predicted circular dichroism in forthcoming experiments. Thus,

version of the $H$-colouring problem is trivial.
  We do the same for the reconfiguration version of the $H$-extension problem.
We consider a relative version ${\bf Hom}(G,H;p)$ of the Hom-graph, the
subgraph of ${\bf Hom}(G,H)$ induced by $H$-colourings that extend a partial
$H$-colouring $p$ of $G$, and show that the graphs $H$ for which ${\bf
Hom}(G,H;p)$ is connected for every choice of $(G,p)$, where $p$ must be
non-null if $H$ is bipartite, are exactly the graphs that admit ${\rm NU}$
polymorphisms. Thus the reconfiguration version of the $H$-extension problem is
trivial if an only if $H$ admits an ${\rm NU}$ polymorphism. We further give
bounds on the diameter of ${\bf Hom}(G,H;p)$ in this case and show that the
shortest path between two vertices can be found in polynomial time.
  Specializing our results to the shortest path reconfiguration problem, we get
that it is trivial for the class of graphs that can be made into ${\rm
NU}$-graphs by adding loops to some subset of the vertices. This class contains
such graphs as chordal graphs and hypercubes for which the shortest path
reconfiguration problem has previously been shown to be trivial.

between a solution and an additional gas, liquid, or solid phase. The
macroscopic theory of adsorption dates back more than a century and is now
well-established. Yet, despite recent advancements, a detailed and
self-contained theory of single-particle adsorption is still lacking. Here, we
bridge this gap by developing a microscopic theory of adsorption kinetics, from
which the macroscopic properties follow directly. One of our central
achievements is the derivation of the microsopic version of the seminal
Ward-Tordai relation which connects the surface and subsurface adsorbate
concentrations via a universal equation that holds for arbitrary adsorption
dynamics. Furthermore, we present a microscopic interpretation of the
Ward-Tordai relation which, in turn, allows us to generalize it to arbitrary
dimension, geometry and initial conditions. The power of our approach is
showcased on a set of hitherto unsolved adsorption problems to which we present
exact analytical solutions. The framework developed herein sheds fresh light on
the fundamentals of adsorption kinetics, which opens new research avenues in
surface science with applications to artificial and biological sensing and to
the design of nano-scale devices.

machine learning. Examples of machine learning approaches that use pairwise
objective functions include differential network in face recognition, metric
learning, bipartite learning, multiple kernel learning, and maximizing of area
under the curve (AUC). Compared to pointwise learning, pairwise learning's
sample size grows quadratically with the number of samples and thus its
complexity. Researchers mostly address this challenge by utilizing an online
learning system. Recent research has, however, offered adaptive sample size
training for smooth loss functions as a better strategy in terms of convergence
and complexity, but without a comprehensive theoretical study. In a distinct
line of research, importance sampling has sparked a considerable amount of
interest in finite pointwise-sum minimization. This is because of the
stochastic gradient variance, which causes the convergence to be slowed
considerably. In this paper, we combine adaptive sample size and importance
sampling techniques for pairwise learning, with convergence guarantees for
nonsmooth convex pairwise loss functions. In particular, the model is trained
stochastically using an expanded training set for a predefined number of
iterations derived from the stability bounds. In addition, we demonstrate that
sampling opposite instances at each iteration reduces the variance of the
gradient, hence accelerating convergence. Experiments on a broad variety of
datasets in AUC maximization confirm the theoretical results.

appropriate form for the non-minimal coupling of $\chi$, we show that it is

effective Planck mass in the Jordan frame during inflation is sufficiently
small, with a phase transition to $\chi \neq 0$ at the end of Higgs inflation
which increases the Jordan frame Planck mass to its presently observed value.
In the Einstein frame this corresponds to a suppression of the Higgs kinetic
term at the end of inflation. We show that the predictions of Higgs inflation
at tree level are unaltered from conventional Higgs Inflation, with the

reproducible analyses for fair comparisons among different solutions. However,
existing related datasets mostly focused on users' field of view (FoV),
ignoring the more important eye gaze information, not to mention the integrated
extraction and analysis of both FoV and eye gaze. Besides, users' behavior

contained videos with subjective and qualitative classification from video

user's head direction will follow his/her gaze direction with the most possible

experimentally explored in an $\omega -2\omega$ setting [Zipp et al, Optica 1,
361 (2014)]. The phases of wavepackets ejected from argon by a strong $2\omega$
pulse were probed as a function of the relative phase of a weaker $\omega$
probe pulse. Numerical simulations solving the time-dependent Schr\""{o}dinger
equation (TDSE) displayed a sensitive dependence of the doubly differential
momentum distribution on the relative phase between the $\omega$ and $2\omega$
fields. Moreover, a surprisingly strong variation of the extracted phase delays
on the intensity of the probe pulse was found. We present a semiclassical
strong-field description of the phase delays in the emission of electrons in an
$\omega -2\omega$ setting and apply it to atomic hydrogen. Non-perturbative
effects in both the $2\omega$ pump and the $\omega$ probe field are included.
The semiclassical description allows tracing phase delays to path interferences
between emission during different points in time of emission within the
temporal unit cell of the two-color laser field. We find good agreement between
the semiclassical saddle-point approximation, the full strong field
approximation (SFA), and previous results applicable in the perturbative limit
of probe fields. We show that the RABBIT-like perturbative description of phase
delays breaks down for stronger fields and higher-energy electron emission. In
this regime, characterization of the ionization signal requires an entire
ensemble of phase delays {$\delta_i(E)$} with $i=1,2,\ldots$ the difference in
photon numbers of the strong $2\omega$ field involved in the interfering paths.
Comparison between SFA and TDSE calculations reveals the influence of the
Coulomb field even in this strong-field scenario.

  Coding",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Semantic communications has received growing interest since it can remarkably
reduce the amount of data to be transmitted without missing critical
information. Most existing works explore the semantic encoding and transmission
for text and apply techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret
the meaning of the text. In this paper, we conceive the semantic communications
for image data that is much more richer in semantics and bandwidth sensitive.
We propose an reinforcement learning based adaptive semantic coding (RL-ASC)
approach that encodes images beyond pixel level. Firstly, we define the
semantic concept of image data that includes the category, spatial arrangement,
and visual feature as the representation unit, and propose a convolutional
semantic encoder to extract semantic concepts. Secondly, we propose the image
reconstruction criterion that evolves from the traditional pixel similarity to
semantic similarity and perceptual performance. Thirdly, we design a novel
RL-based semantic bit allocation model, whose reward is the increase in
rate-semantic-perceptual performance after encoding a certain semantic concept
with adaptive quantization level. Thus, the task-related information is
preserved and reconstructed properly while less important data is discarded.
Finally, we propose the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) based semantic
decoder that fuses both locally and globally features via an attention module.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-ASC is noise robust and
could reconstruct visually pleasant and semantic consistent image, and saves
times of bit cost compared to standard codecs and other deep learning-based
image codecs.

robust properties of observational features of the spiral arms. The resulting

Search-based software testing (SBST) is an automated approach to generating

coverage criterion (e.g., branch coverage). However, a good test suite must
have different properties, which cannot be captured by using an individual
coverage criterion. Therefore, the state-of-the-art approach combines multiple
criteria to generate test cases. As combining multiple coverage criteria brings
multiple objectives for optimization, it hurts the test suites' coverage for
certain criteria compared with using the single criterion. To cope with this
problem, we propose a novel approach named \textbf{smart selection}. Based on
the coverage correlations among criteria and the coverage goals' subsumption
relationships, smart selection selects a subset of coverage goals to reduce the
number of optimization objectives and avoid missing any properties of all
criteria. We conduct experiments to evaluate smart selection on $400$ Java
classes with three state-of-the-art genetic algorithms. On average, smart
selection outperforms combining all goals on $65.1\%$ of the classes having

single giant atom coupled to a structured bath, here we study the interaction
between two giant atoms mediated by a structured waveguide, e.g., a photonic
crystal waveguide. This environment is characterized by a finite energy band
and a band gap, which affect atomic dynamics beyond the Markovian regime. Here
we show that, inside the band, decoherence-free interaction is possible for
different atom-cavity detunings, but is degraded from the continuous-waveguide
case by time delay and other non-Markovian effects. Outside the band, where
atoms interact through the overlap of bound states, we find that giant atoms
can interact more strongly and over longer distances than small atoms for some
parameters -- for instance, when restricting the maximum coupling strength
achievable per coupling point. The results presented here may find applications
in quantum simulation and quantum gate implementation.

consists of recommendation dialogs for sociable conversational recommendation,
where items and entities were annotated using automatic keyword or pattern

there is a substantial number of cases where items and entities were either

mean $M_{Bol}$ which is a mathematical average of independent $M_{Bol}$ values
predicted at different filters, while the uncertainty of $L$ is the uncertainty
propagated from the uncertainty of the mean $M_{Bol}$. The mean standard $L$ of
the sample stars are compared to the corresponding $L$ values according to the
Stefan-Boltzmann law. A very high correlation ($R^2>0.999$) is found. Comparing
histogram distributions of errors shows that uncertainties associated with the
mean standard $L$ (peak at $\sim2.5$ per cent) are much smaller than the
uncertainties of $L$ (peak at $\sim8$ per cent) by the Stefan-Boltzmann law.
Increasing the number of filters used in predicting the mean $M_{Bol}$
increases the accuracy of the standard stellar luminosity. Extinction law,
color-color relations and color excess - color excess relations for Gaia

considered as a chess-board of size $n\times n\times \ldots\times n$ ($d$
times), containing $n^d$ cells with $n^{d-1}$ non-attacking rooks. Each cell is
identified by a $d$-tuple $(e_1,e_2,\ldots ,e_d)$ where $e_i \in \{1,2,\ldots
,n\}$. For $d = 3$ we prove that such a chess-board represents precisely one
main class.
  A subsystem $T$ induced by a family of sets $<E_1,E_2,\ldots ,E_d>$ over
$\{1,2,\ldots ,n\}$ is real if $E_i \subset \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}$ for each $i \in
\{1,2,\ldots ,d\}$. The density of $T$ is the ratio of contained rooks to the
number of cells in $T$. The distance between two subsystems is the minimum
Hamming distance between cell pairs. Replacing $k$ sets of $<E_1,E_2,\ldots
,E_d>$ by their complements, a subsystem $U$ is obtained with distance $k$
between $T$ and $U$. All these subsystems, including $T$, form a partition of
the chess-board. We prove that in such a partition, the number of rooks in a
$U$ and the density of $U$ can be determined from the number of rooks in $T$
and the number of cells in $T$ and $U$ and the value of $(-1)^k$. We examine
the subsystem couple $(T,U)$ in the $2$- and $3$-dimensional cases, where $U$
is the most distant unique subsystem from a real $T$. On the fly, a new
identity of binomial coefficients is proved.

yet essential to inform therapy, patient management, and long-term after-care.
Patient characteristics such as age, motor and pupil responsiveness, hypoxia
and hypotension, and radiological findings on computed tomography (CT), have
been identified as important variables for TBI outcome prediction. CT is the
acute imaging modality of choice in clinical practice because of its
acquisition speed and widespread availability. However, this modality is mainly
used for qualitative and semi-quantitative assessment, such as the Marshall
scoring system, which is prone to subjectivity and human errors. This work
explores the predictive power of imaging biomarkers extracted from
routinely-acquired hospital admission CT scans using a state-of-the-art, deep
learning TBI lesion segmentation method. We use lesion volumes and
corresponding lesion statistics as inputs for an extended TBI outcome
prediction model. We compare the predictive power of our proposed features to
the Marshall score, independently and when paired with classic TBI biomarkers.
We find that automatically extracted quantitative CT features perform similarly
or better than the Marshall score in predicting unfavourable TBI outcomes.
Leveraging automatic atlas alignment, we also identify frontal extra-axial
lesions as important indicators of poor outcome. Our work may contribute to a
better understanding of TBI, and provides new insights into how automated
neuroimaging analysis can be used to improve prognostication after TBI.

two-stage robust optimization problems with decision dependent information

the orienteering problem as our working example, a challenging problem from the

proposed solution schemes, in which we show that exact solution method
outperforms at times the K-adaptability approximation, however, the
strengthened K-adaptability formulation can provide good quality solutions in
larger instances while significantly outperforming existing approximation

positive samples from negative ones during training in which negative sampling
serves as an essential component in learning the evolving user preferences
through historical records. Except for randomly sampling negative samples from
a uniformly distributed subset, many delicate methods have been proposed to
mine negative samples with high quality. However, due to the inherent
randomness of negative sampling, false negative samples are inevitably
collected in model training. Current strategies mainly focus on removing such
false negative samples, which leads to overlooking potential user interests,
lack of recommendation diversity, less model robustness, and suffering from
exposure bias. To this end, we propose a novel method that can Utilize False
Negative samples for sequential Recommendation (UFNRec) to improve model
performance. We first devise a simple strategy to extract false negative
samples and then transfer these samples to positive samples in the following
training process. Furthermore, we construct a teacher model to provide soft
labels for false negative samples and design a consistency loss to regularize
the predictions of these samples from the student model and the teacher model.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize false negative
samples instead of simply removing them for the sequential recommendation.
Experiments on three benchmark public datasets are conducted using three widely
applied SOTA models. The experiment results demonstrate that our proposed
UFNRec can effectively draw information from false negative samples and further
improve the performance of SOTA models. The code is available at

Using an interactive web-based experiment conducted half a year after the

be generated by reprocessing the emission of the accretion flow in the
optically thick outflows. The model can well interpret the observed emission

strong thermal fluctuations at high temperatures. Accurate reconstructions can
be made where the thermal fluctuations dominate over the correlations and
consequently the statistic methods in general fail. Meanwhile, we unveil the

can badly affect both the environment and human health. Therefore, in search of
lead-free perovskites, the replacement of lead with eco-friendly elements like
bismuth and sodium may be a good strategy. Bismuth has very similar electronic
properties as that of lead so it gives very efficient perovskites. Therefore,
double perovskites containg Bi element X$_2$NaBiCl$_6$ (X=Cs, Rb, K) are
explored here in terms of the structural, opto-electronic , and thermoelectric

for optoelectronic applications such as ultraviolet sensors and detectors due
to the prominent absorption peaks in ultraviolet region (10eV-30eV), low
reflection (5-7%), and high optical conductivity. In addition to the alluring
optoelectronic features, the compounds under study have figure of merit being
close to unity so these are also promising for thermoelectric applications.

paper focuses on engines that transform chemical work into mechanical work
through energy and particle exchanges with thermal sources at different
chemical potentials. Irreversibility is introduced by modelling the engine
transformations with finite-time dynamics generated by a time-depending quantum
master equation. Quantum degenerate gases provide maximum efficiency for
reversible engines, whereas the classical limit implies small efficiency. For
irreversible engines, both the output power and the efficiency at maximum power
are much larger in the quantum regime than in the classical limit. The analysis
of ideal homogeneous gases grasps the impact of quantum statistics on the above
performances, which persists in the presence of interactions and more general
trapping. The performance dependence on different types of Bose-Einstein
Condensates (BECs) is also studied. BECs under considerations are standard BECs
with a finite fraction of particles in the ground state, and generalised BECs
where eigenstates with parallel momenta, or those with coplanar momenta are
macroscopically occupied according to the confinement anisotropy. Quantum

regarding the origin and propagation of astro-particles. Due to the limited

to an innovative design, the High Energy cosmic-Radiation Detection (HERD)
facility will allow direct observation up to this energy region: the instrument
is mainly based on a 3D segmented, isotropic and homogeneous calorimeter which
properly measures the energy of particles coming from each direction and it
will be made of about 7500 LYSO cubic crystals. The read-out of the
scintillation light is done with two independent systems: the first one based
on wave-length shifting fibers coupled to Intensified scientific CMOS cameras,
the second one is made of two photo-diodes with different active areas
connected to a custom front-end electronics. This photo-diode system is
designed to achieve a huge dynamic range, larger than $10^7$, while having a
small power consumption, few mW per channel. Thanks to a good signal-to-noise
ratio, the capability of a proper calibration, by using signals of both
non-interacting and showering particles, is also guaranteed. In this paper, the
current design and the performance obtained by several tests of the photo-diode

reaches the equilibrium macrostate in a process in which the system and

This research proposes a lightweight architecture that is efficient in terms of

architectures like MobileNet, Inception, and ResNet, including vision
transformers. Methodologies to minimize computational requirements such as
depth-wise separable convolution and global average pooling (GAP) layer,

have been experimented. Our results indicate that a custom model of 590K

Vision transformers in terms of faster inference times (12 ms). Blurpool fared
outperformed other techniques, with an accuracy of 83.98%. Augmentations had a
paradoxical effect on the model performance. No direct correlation between
depth-wise and 3x3 convolutions on inference time, they, however, they played a
direct role in improving model efficiency by enabling the networks to go deeper

learns occlusion-invariant features, which is analogous to other siamese
methods while the latter learns other invariance. By relaxing MIM formulation
into an equivalent siamese form, MIM methods can be interpreted in a unified
framework with conventional methods, among which only a) data transformations,
i.e. what invariance to learn, and b) similarity measurements are different.
Furthermore, taking MAE (He et al.) as a representative example of MIM, we
empirically find the success of MIM models relates a little to the choice of
similarity functions, but the learned occlusion invariant feature introduced by
masked image -- it turns out to be a favored initialization for vision
transformers, even though the learned feature could be less semantic. We hope
our findings could inspire researchers to develop more powerful self-supervised

for energy storage owing to their fast charging discharging rates, long life

important performance-related characteristics of a supercapacitor's electrode.
In the current study, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were used to determine
the impact of various physicochemical properties of carbon-based materials on
the capacitive performance of electric double-layer capacitors. Published
experimental datasets from 147 references (4899 data entries) were extracted
and then used to train and test the ML models, to determine the relative
importance of electrode material features on specific capacitance. These
features include current density, pore volume, pore size, presence of defects,
potential window, specific surface area, oxygen, and nitrogen content of the
carbon-based electrode material. Additionally, categorical variables as the
testing method, electrolyte, and carbon structure of the electrodes are
considered as well. Among five applied regression models, an extreme gradient
boosting model was found to best correlate those features with the capacitive
performance, highlighting that the specific surface area, the presence of
nitrogen doping, and the potential window are the most significant descriptors
for the specific capacitance. These findings are summarized in a modular and

required laser frequencies for the atom interferometry are provided by
free-space acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) and resonant electro-optic phase
modulators (EOMs). The optical phase-locked loop between the two optical paths
derived from the same laser provides an easy frequency manipulation between two
laser frequencies separated by the hyperfine frequency of 6.835 GHz using an
AOM and an EOM, respectively. Our scheme avoids parasite Raman transitions
present in the direct EOM modulation scheme (modulating directly at the
frequency of the hyperfine splitting), which have detrimental effects on the
accuracy of the gravity measurements. The optical phase-locked loop also
provides a convenient way for vibration compensation through the Raman lasers'
phase offset. Furthermore, the modular design approach allows plug-and-play
nature on each individual optic module and also increases the mechanical
stability of the optical systems. We demonstrate high-precision gravity
measurements with 17.8 $\mu\text{Gal}$ stability over 250 seconds averaging

dependent censoring. This means that $T$ is right censored by a censoring time
$C$, which is dependent on $T$ (even after conditioning out the effects of the

variable, is leveraged to tackle the confounding issue. Further, it is assumed
that $T$ and $C$ follow a joint regression model with bivariate Gaussian error
terms and an unspecified covariance matrix such that the dependent censoring
can be handled in a flexible manner. Conditions under which the model is
identifiable are given, a two-step estimation procedure is proposed, and it is
shown that the resulting estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal.
Simulations are used to confirm the validity and finite-sample performance of
the estimation procedure. Finally, the proposed method is used to estimate the
causal effect of job training programs on unemployment duration.

promising spectrum bands for sixth-generation (6G) and beyond communications.
In this paper, a dual-band angular-resolvable wideband channel measurement in
an indoor L-shaped hallway is presented and THz channel characteristics at
306-321 GHz and 356-371 GHz are analyzed. It is found that conventional
close-in and alpha-beta path loss models cannot take good care of large-scale
fading in the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) case, for which a modified alpha-beta
path loss model for the NLoS case is proposed and verified in the NLoS case for
both indoor and outdoor L-shaped scenarios. To describe both large-scale and
small-scale fading, a ray-tracing (RT)-statistical hybrid channel model is
proposed in the THz hallway scenario. Specifically in the hybrid model, the
deterministic part in hybrid channel modeling uses RT modeling of dominant
multi-path components (MPCs), i.e., LoS and multi-bounce reflected paths in the
near-NLoS region, while dominant MPCs at far-NLoS positions can be deduced
based on the developed statistical evolving model. The evolving model describes
the continuous change of arrival angle, power and delay of dominant MPCs in the
NLoS region. On the other hand, non-dominant MPCs are generated statistically.
The proposed hybrid approach reduces the computational cost and solves the
inaccuracy or even missing of dominant MPCs through RT at far-NLoS positions.

identification of suitable institutions for collaboration is sometimes
difficult and therefore institutional collaboration recommendation systems can
be vital. Currently, there are no well-developed institutional collaboration
recommendation systems. In order to bridge this gap, we design a framework that
recognizes thematic strengths and core competencies of institutions, which can
in turn be used for collaboration recommendations. The framework, based on NLP
and network analysis techniques, is capable of determining the strengths of an
institution in different thematic areas within a field and thereby determining
the core competency and potential core competency areas of that institution. A
major advantage of the system is that it can help to determine and improve the
research portfolio of an institution within a field through suitable
collaboration, which may lead to the overall improvement of the performance of
the institution in that field. The framework is demonstrated by analyzing the
performance of 195 Indian institutions in the field of 'Computer Science'. Upon
validation using standard metrics for novelty, coverage and diversity of
recommendation systems, the framework is found to be of sufficient coverage and
capable of tossing novel and diverse recommendations. The article thus presents
an institutional collaboration recommendation system which can be used by
institutions to identify potential collaborators.

of primordial black holes is constantly changing due to accretion. In addition,
we have shown that considering the dynamic event horizon in some masses and in

generates the analog bits, which are then thresholded to obtain the bits that

significant improvement in sample quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed
approach can achieve strong performance in both discrete image generation and

Our algorithmic approach suggests a way of transforming a compact structure

Analogous to the pluripotent stem cells that can grow into a preprogrammed
shape according to coded information, which we call DNA, compactly stacked
panels named the zygote structure can evolve into arbitrary 3-D structures by
programming their connection path. Our stacking algorithm obtains this coded
sequence by inversely stacking the voxelized surface of the desired structure
into a tree. Applying the connection path obtained by the stacking algorithm,
the compactly stacked panels named the zygote structure can be deployed into
diverse large 3-D structures. We conceptually demonstrated our pluripotent
evolving structure by energy releasing commercial spring hinges and thermally
actuated shape memory alloy (SMA) hinges, respectively. We also show that the
proposed concept enables the fabrication of large structures in a significantly
smaller workspace.

adopt and enhance a dataset for analyzing autism-related actions using videos
of children captured in uncontrolled environments (e.g. videos collected with
consumer-grade cameras, in varied environments). The data is pre-processed by
detecting the target child in the video to reduce the impact of background
noise. Motivated by the effectiveness of temporal convolutional models, we
propose both light-weight and conventional models capable of extracting action
features from video frames and classifying autism-related behaviors by
analyzing the relationships between frames in a video. Through extensive
evaluations on the feature extraction and learning strategies, we demonstrate
that the best performance is achieved with an Inflated 3D Convnet and
Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Networks, achieving a 0.83 Weighted F1-score

called missions. While skills are often programmed at a relatively low
abstraction level, their coordination is architecturally separated and often
expressed in higher-level languages or frameworks. State machines have been the
go-to language to model behavior for decades, but recently, behavior trees have
gained attention among roboticists. Although several implementations of
behavior trees are in use, little is known about their usage and scope in the
real world.How do concepts offered by behavior trees relate to traditional
languages, such as state machines? How are concepts in behavior trees and state
machines used in actual applications? This paper is a study of the key language
concepts in behavior trees as realized in domain-specific languages (DSLs),
internal and external DSLs offered as libraries, and their use in open-source
robotic applications supported by the Robot Operating System (ROS). We analyze
behavior-tree DSLs and compare them to the standard language for behavior
models in robotics:state machines. We identify DSLs for both behavior-modeling
languages, and we analyze five in-depth.We mine open-source repositories for
robotic applications that use the analyzed DSLs and analyze their usage. We
identify similarities between behavior trees and state machines in terms of
language design and the concepts offered to accommodate the needs of the
robotics domain. We observed that the usage of behavior-tree DSLs in
open-source projects is increasing rapidly. We observed similar usage patterns
at model structure and at code reuse in the behavior-tree and state-machine
models within the mined open-source projects. We contribute all extracted
models as a dataset, hoping to inspire the community to use and further develop
behavior trees, associated tools, and analysis techniques.

infinitely many prime numbers $p$ for which the imaginary quadratic fields
$\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-(p - 1)}),\ldots,\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-(p - k)})$ and
$\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-p(p - 1)}),\ldots, \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-p(p - k)})$ are all
$p$-rational. This can be construed as analogous results in the spirit of
Iizuka's conjecture on the divisibility of class numbers of consecutive

consecutive real quadratic fields by proving the existence of infinitely many
$p$-rational fields of the form $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p^{2} + 1})$ and
$\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p^{2} + 2})$. The result for imaginary quadratic fields is
accomplished by producing infinitely many primes for which the corresponding

multi-modal understanding, which aims to search for relevant video (text) given
a query (video). Existing methods typically employ completely heterogeneous
visual-textual information to align video and text, whilst lacking the
awareness of homogeneous high-level semantic information residing in both
modalities. To fill this gap, in this work, we propose a novel
visual-linguistic aligning model named HiSE for VTR, which improves the
cross-modal representation by incorporating explicit high-level semantics.
First, we explore the hierarchical property of explicit high-level semantics,
and further decompose it into two levels, i.e. discrete semantics and holistic
semantics. Specifically, for visual branch, we exploit an off-the-shelf
semantic entity predictor to generate discrete high-level semantics. In
parallel, a trained video captioning model is employed to output holistic
high-level semantics. As for the textual modality, we parse the text into three
parts including occurrence, action and entity. In particular, the occurrence
corresponds to the holistic high-level semantics, meanwhile both action and
entity represent the discrete ones. Then, different graph reasoning techniques
are utilized to promote the interaction between holistic and discrete
high-level semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with the aid of
explicit high-level semantics, our method achieves the superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets, including MSR-VTT,

probe the different atmospheric layers within the stellar chromosphere
providing a tomographic view of the atmospheric dynamics. The project aims to
define a robust mm-based activity indicator for the cool main-sequence stars
($\mathrm{T_{eff}} \sim$ 5000 - 7000 K). We derive the mm-brightness
temperature ($\mathrm{T_B(\nu)}$) spectral indices ($\mathrm{\alpha_{mm}}$) for
cool stars including the Sun using archival data in the 30 - 1000 GHz range.
The derived values for $\mathrm{\alpha_{mm}}$ are explored as a function of
various physical parameters and empirical power-law functions were derived.
$\mathrm{\alpha_{mm}}$ estimates were also compared with other activity
indicators. Despite the estimation errors, $\mathrm{\alpha_{mm}}$ values could
well distinguish the cool stars, unlike common activity indicators. The low
estimation errors on the derived trends of $\mathrm{\alpha_{mm}}$ versus
physical parameters suggest that $\mathrm{\alpha_{mm}}$ could be a robust
activity indicator. $\mathrm{\alpha_{mm}}$, which is linked to chromospheric
thermal stratification and activity in cool stars can well distinguish and
physically characterise the stars more robustly than common activity
indicators. We emphasise the need for multi-frequency data across the mm-band
for stars, with a range of physical parameters and gathered at multiple epochs
during activity cycles. This will help explore $\mathrm{\alpha_{mm}}$ in a
statistically robust manner and study the emergence of chromospheric heating on

optimal encoder search over the space of multi-resolution trees. The
abstractions emerge in a task-relevant manner as a function of agent

demonstrate the approach on a number of examples, and provide a discussion

Networks (CGNs) can generate novel images from random combinations of shape,
texture, and background manifolds. These images can be utilized to train an
invariant classifier, avoiding the wide spread problem of deep architectures
learning spurious correlations rather than meaningful ones. As a consequence,
out-of-domain robustness is improved. However, the CGN architecture comprises
multiple over parameterized networks, namely BigGAN and U2-Net. Training these
networks requires appropriate background knowledge and extensive computation.
Since one does not always have access to the precise training details, nor do
they always possess the necessary knowledge of counterfactuals, our work
addresses the following question: Can we use the knowledge embedded in
pre-trained CGNs to train a lower-capacity model, assuming black-box access
(i.e., only access to the pretrained CGN model) to the components of the
architecture? In this direction, we propose a novel work named SKDCGN that
attempts knowledge transfer using Knowledge Distillation (KD). In our proposed
architecture, each independent mechanism (shape, texture, background) is
represented by a student 'TinyGAN' that learns from the pretrained teacher
'BigGAN'. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method using
state-of-the-art datasets such as ImageNet, and MNIST by using KD and
appropriate loss functions. Moreover, as an additional contribution, our paper
conducts a thorough study on the composition mechanism of the CGNs, to gain a
better understanding of how each mechanism influences the classification
accuracy of an invariant classifier. Code available at:

remarkable achievements in deep learning across various challenging computer

has provided promising approaches to automating the design of network
architectures for lower prediction error. Recently, the emerging application
scenarios of deep learning have raised higher demands for network architectures
considering multiple design criteria: number of parameters/floating-point
operations, and inference latency, among others. From an optimization point of
view, the NAS tasks involving multiple design criteria are intrinsically
multiobjective optimization problems; hence, it is reasonable to adopt
evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms for tackling them.
Nonetheless, there is still a clear gap confining the related research along
this pathway: on the one hand, there is a lack of a general problem formulation
of NAS tasks from an optimization point of view; on the other hand, there are
challenges in conducting benchmark assessments of EMO algorithms on NAS tasks.
To bridge the gap: (i) we formulate NAS tasks into general multi-objective
optimization problems and analyze the complex characteristics from an
optimization point of view; (ii) we present an end-to-end pipeline, dubbed
$\texttt{EvoXBench}$, to generate benchmark test problems for EMO algorithms to
run efficiently -- without the requirement of GPUs or Pytorch/Tensorflow; (iii)
we instantiate two test suites comprehensively covering two datasets, seven
search spaces, and three hardware devices, involving up to eight objectives.
Based on the above, we validate the proposed test suites using six
representative EMO algorithms and provide some empirical analyses. The code of
$\texttt{EvoXBench}$ is available from

Moreover, due to the decentralized nature, interoperability of self-sovereign

establishing trust or enabling secure communication between entities without

we also present a reference model that maps the required components and
considerations that build up a self-sovereign identity implementation. The

geometry-based invariants (i.e., $SO$, $SO_{1}$, $SO_{2}$, $SO_{3}$, $SO_{4}$,
$SO_{5}$, $SO_{6}$). The Sombor index was defined as $SO(G)=\sum\limits_{uv\in
E(G)}\sqrt{d_{u}^{2}+d_{v}^{2}}$, the first Sombor index was defined as
$SO_{1}(G)= \frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_{uv\in E(G)}|d_{u}^{2}-d_{v}^{2}|$, where
$d_{u}$ denotes the degree of vertex $u$.
  In this paper, we consider the mathematical and chemistry properties of these
geometry-based invariants. We determine the maximum trees (resp. unicyclic
graphs) with given diameter, the maximum trees with given matching number, the
maximum trees with given pendent vertices, the maximum trees (resp. minimum
trees) with given branching number, the minimum trees with given maximum degree
and second maximum degree, the minimum unicyclic graphs with given maximum
degree and girth, the minimum connected graphs with given maximum degree and
pendent vertices, and some properties of maximum connected graphs with given
pendent vertices with respect to the first Sombor index $SO_{1}$.
  As an application, we inaugurate these geometry-based invariants and verify
their chemical applicability. We used these geometry-based invariants to model
the acentric factor (resp. entropy, enthalpy of vaporization, etc.) of alkanes,
and obtained satisfactory predictive potential, which indicates that these
geometry-based invariants can be successfully used to model the thermodynamic
properties of compounds.

compression appear in several problems of science and engineering, e.g., in the
study of the resisting mechanisms of masonry structures, as well as in the
design of spider web-inspired web structures. This work generalizes previous
results on the existence of cable webs that are able to support assigned sets
of nodal forces under tension. We extend such a problem to the limit analysis
of compression-only 'strut nets' subjected to fixed and variable nodal loads.
These systems provide discrete element models of masonry bodies, which lie
inside the polygon/polyhedron with vertices at the points of application of the
given forces ('underlying masonry structures'). It is assumed that fixed nodal
forces are combined with variable forces growing proportionally to a scalar
multiplier (load multiplier), and that the supporting strut net is subjected to
kinematic constraints at given nodal positions.

due to the reduced group velocity of light, but a very low group velocity is
usually achieved in a narrow bandwidth, accompanied by extreme sensitivity to
imperfections that causes increased disorder-induced attenuation. Recent
theories have suggested an ideal solution to this problem - unidirectional
chiral photonic states, previously discovered in structures known as photonic
topological insulators, not only resist backscattering from imperfections but
can also be slowed down in the entire topological bandgap with multiple
windings in the Brillouin zone. Here, we report on the experimental
demonstration of broadband topological slow light in a photonic topological
insulator. When coupled with periodic resonators that form flat bands, the
chiral photonic states can wind many times around the Brillouin zone, achieving
an ultra-low group velocity in the entire topological bandgap. This
demonstration extends the scope of topological photonics into slow light
engineering and opens a unique avenue in the dispersion manipulation of chiral
photonic states.

Recognition (NER) tasks, with the goal of reducing the necessity for
hand-crafted annotations. Although there are numerous remarkable annotation
tools for NER labeling, the subject of integrating weak labeling sources is
still unexplored. We introduce a web-based tool for text annotation called
SciAnnotate, which stands for scientific annotation tool. Compared to
frequently used text annotation tools, our annotation tool allows for the
development of weak labels in addition to providing a manual annotation
experience. Our tool provides users with multiple user-friendly interfaces for
creating weak labels. SciAnnotate additionally allows users to incorporate
their own language models and visualize the output of their model for
evaluation. In this study, we take multi-source weak label denoising as an
example, we utilized a Bertifying Conditional Hidden Markov Model to denoise
the weak label generated by our tool. We also evaluate our annotation tool
against the dataset provided by Mysore which contains 230 annotated materials
synthesis procedures. The results shows that a 53.7% reduction in annotation
time obtained AND a 1.6\% increase in recall using weak label denoising. Online
demo is available at https://sciannotate.azurewebsites.net/(demo account can be
found in README), but we don't host a model server with it, please check the

as well as indigenously prepared databases. Prior analysis was carried out to
check the distribution of the data points of the response variables and found
that in most of the cases, the data is not normally distributed. The outcome of
the RF model performance is sufficiently accurate to predict the response
variables on the test data and also shows its robustness against overfitting,
outliers, multicollinearity and distribution of data points. The parity plots
between the machine learning predicted values against the computed values using
density functional theory (DFT) shows linear behavior with adjusted R2 values
lying in the range of 0.80 to 0.94 for all the predicted properties for
different types of Heusler alloys. Feature importance analysis shows that the
valence electron numbers plays an important feature role in the prediction for
most of the predicted outcomes. Case studies with one full Heusler alloy and
one quaternary Heusler alloy were also mentioned comparing the machine learning
predicted results with our earlier theoretical calculated values and
experimentally measured results, suggesting high accuracy of the model
predicted results.

while preserving some set of invariants. That object might be a file, a row in
a database, or perhaps an entry in a distributed system. Its invariants may
place limits on its relationships with other objects, and generally include
maintaining a unique identity across updates.
  The system maintaining these invariants is responsible for not equivocating,
or presenting conflicting versions of an object. We call this absence of
equivocation integrity.
  Today the system providing integrity to an object also manages its state.
Indeed, it has long been assumed that this must be the case, and that only the
system managing an object's state can provide it with integrity.
  We show that this assumption is wrong. Objects can maintain the integrity of
one system while having their state fully managed by another.

coverage area is divided into multiple cells. Interference is one of the most
important challenges in cellular networks which causes problems by reducing the
quality of the service. Cell-Free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) is a novel technolgy in which a large number of distributed access
points (APs) are concurrently serving a small number of user equipment (UE). CF
network can be an alternative technology to cellular networks for reducing
interference. A challenging task in a CF network is scalability, where although
the number of UEs tends to infinity, the computational complexity must remain
finite in each AP or UE. In this paper, we provide two architectures of Dense
fully connected neural network (Dense_Net) and 1D convolution neural network
(Conv_Net) to be implemented in different cases in terms of the number of
antennas in each AP/UE and the method for the combining vector. The Dense_Net
outperforms the Conv_Net in all the cases. For instance, in the first case it
has a %62.87 improvement in terms of loss. The results show that our proposed
method performs better in terms of obtaining optimal values for spectral
efficiency (SE).

phase stratification phenomenon for the order parameter. The formation of a
giant vortex can be explained as there is not enough space for a standard
vortex lattice. Keep increasing the rotational velocity the giant vortex will
disappear and there will be an appearance of a superfluid ring. In the giant
vortex region, the number of vortices measured from winding number and
rotational velocity always satisfies the linear Feynman relation. However, when
the superfluid ring starts to appear, the number of vortices in the disk will
decrease though the rotational velocity is increasing, where most of the order

physical, mental and behavioural changes in all living beings with a period of
roughly 24 h. Wearable accelerometers are typically used in livestock
applications to record animal movement from which we can estimate the activity
type. Here, we use the overall movement recorded by accelerometers worn on the
necks of newborn calves for a period of 8 weeks. From the movement data, we
calculate 24 h periodicity intensities corresponding to circadian rhythms, from
a 7-day window that slides through up to 8-weeks of data logging. The strength
or intensity of the 24 h periodicity is computed at intervals as the calves
become older, which is an indicator of individual calf welfare. We observe that
the intensities of these 24 h periodicities for individual calves, derived from
movement data, increase and decrease synchronously in a herd of 19 calves. Our
results show that external factors affecting the welfare of the herd can be
observed by processing and visualising movement data in this way and our method
reveals insights that are not observable from movement data alone.

a drift in user behaviour is emulated, and the proposed framework is deployed

bivariate fractal interpolation functions over triangular interpolating domain
using the concept of vertex coloring and to propose a double integration
formula for the constructed interpolation functions. Unlike the conventional
constructions, each vertex in the partition of the triangular region has been
assigned a color such that the chromatic number of the partition is 3. A new
method for the partitioning of the triangle is proposed with a result
concerning the chromatic number of its graph. Following the construction, a
formula determining the vertical scaling factor is provided. With the newly
defined vertical scaling factor, it is clearly observed that the value of the
double integral coincides with the integral value calculated using fractal
theory. Further, a relation connecting the fractal interpolation function with
the equation of the plane passing through the vertices of the triangle is
established. Convergence of the proposed method to the actual integral value is
proven with sufficient lemmas and theorems. Sufficient examples are also
provided to illustrate the method of construction and to verify the formula of
double integration.
