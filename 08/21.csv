GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction nanowire solar cell arrays. It is done by performing
coupled optoelectronic simulations to find the optimal doping for the GaAs core
and AlGaAs shell, and to see the influence of GaAs and AlGaAs shell thickness
and junction positions on the solar cell performance. Further, the impact of
different surface effects that exists at the semiconductor interface such as
surface traps, surface recombination velocities, and associated lifetime
degradation are also investigated. It has been observed that a high core and
shell doping is essential to achieve the appropriate band configuration and
carrier extraction. Further, it is observed that having a larger doping density
is more important than having a larger lifetime. The importance of the
thickness and the passivation properties of the radial and axial AlGaAs layer
is also examined and it has been observed that having a thick AlGaAs shell at
the cost of the i-GaAs region can be detrimental to the performance due to
increased local carrier generation and recombination. Finally, the effect of
having different Aluminium compositions (on the shell) on the photogeneration
inside the nanowire is examined and it was observed that having a large
Aluminium composition can confine most of the photogeneration to the inner GaAs
regions, thus potentially allowing for thicker Aluminium shells which can more
efficiently prevent surface recombination.

multidimensional Walsh-Hadamard transform has a considerably lower
computational complexity (involving $O(N^d)$ operations) in contrast to
classical Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (involving $O(N^d~\log_2 N^d)$

use of qubits, where only $\log_2 N $ qubits are sufficient for sequential
processing of an image of $ N \times N $ pixels. Selected applications of the

including fibers, bundles, and branches. Often, it is unclear how these
structural motifs convey specific advantages to bacterial strains under
challenging conditions. In oxygen-limited environments, dense bacterial
aggregates generally deplete oxygen, which leads to arrest of bacterial growth.
However, we observed that biofilm-forming Bacillus subtilis could use branching
patterns to escape from these crowded regions by tracking the oxygen gradient.
The process depends on the chain-forming ability of the biofilm. As a result of
collective branching triggered by bending and mechanical buckling, bacteria can
extend from the oxygen-depleted biofilm core to the oxygen available periphery.
Remarkably, these bacterial branches are strongly chiral and curve in a
clockwise direction. Our analysis revealed that the surface friction and axial
rotation of the twisting cell wall break left-right symmetry on solid surfaces
and drive chiral bending of bacterial chains. We further observed that the
chirality of individual branches could propagate across a large scale and shape
the macroscopic morphology of the colony under a limited spatiotemporal growth
profile. Taken together, our results provide new insights into how simple
physical interactions lead to bacterial collaboration and promote the survival
of biofilm-forming strains in challenging environments.

(CL). Many approaches have been proposed to deal with catastrophic forgetting
(CF) in CIL. Most methods incrementally construct a single classifier for all
classes of all tasks in a single head network. To prevent CF, a popular
approach is to memorize a small number of samples from previous tasks and
replay them during training of the new task. However, this approach still
suffers from serious CF as the parameters learned for previous tasks are
updated or adjusted with only the limited number of saved samples in the
memory. This paper proposes an entirely different approach that builds a
separate classifier (head) for each task (called a multi-head model) using a
transformer network, called MORE. Instead of using the saved samples in memory
to update the network for previous tasks/classes in the existing approach, MORE
leverages the saved samples to build a task specific classifier (adding a new
classification head) without updating the network learned for previous
tasks/classes. The model for the new task in MORE is trained to learn the
classes of the task and also to detect samples that are not from the same data
distribution (i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD)) of the task. This enables the
classifier for the task to which the test instance belongs to produce a high
score for the correct class and the classifiers of other tasks to produce low
scores because the test instance is not from the data distributions of these
classifiers. Experimental results show that MORE outperforms state-of-the-art

  Learning",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  While distributed optimization algorithms have the merits in parallel
processing and protecting local data security, they often suffer from slow
convergence compared with centralized optimization algorithms. This paper
focuses on how small amount of data sharing could benefit distributed
optimization and learning for more advanced optimization algorithms.
Specifically, we consider how data sharing could benefit distributed
multi-block alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and
preconditioned conjugate gradient method (PCG) with application in machine
learning tasks of linear and logistic regression. These algorithms are commonly
known as algorithms between the first and the second order methods, and we show
that data sharing could hugely boost the convergence speed for this class of
the algorithms. Theoretically, we prove that a small amount of data share leads
to improvements from near-worst to near-optimal convergence rate when applying
ADMM and PCG methods to machine learning tasks. We further propose a meta
randomized data-sharing scheme and provide its tailored applications in
multi-block ADMM and PCG methods in order to enjoy both the benefit from
data-sharing and from the efficiency of distributed computing. From the
numerical evidences, we are convinced that our algorithms provide good quality
of estimators in both the least square and the logistic regressions within much
fewer iterations by only sharing 5% of pre-fixed data, while purely distributed
optimization algorithms may take hundreds more times of iterations to converge.
We hope that the discovery resulted from this paper would encourage even a
small amount of data sharing among different regions to combat difficult global
learning problems.

effective technique to reduce the dimensionality of multi-view unlabeled data.
The existing methods assume that all of views are complete. However, multi-view
data are usually incomplete, i.e., a part of instances are presented on some
views but not all views. Besides, learning the complete similarity graph, as an
important promising technology in existing MUFS methods, cannot achieve due to
the missing views. In this paper, we propose a complementary and consensus
learning-based incomplete multi-view unsupervised feature selection method
(C$^{2}$IMUFS) to address the aforementioned issues. Concretely, C$^{2}$IMUFS
integrates feature selection into an extended weighted non-negative matrix
factorization model equipped with adaptive learning of view-weights and a
sparse $\ell_{2,p}$-norm, which can offer better adaptability and flexibility.
By the sparse linear combinations of multiple similarity matrices derived from
different views, a complementary learning-guided similarity matrix
reconstruction model is presented to obtain the complete similarity graph in
each view. Furthermore, C$^{2}$IMUFS learns a consensus clustering indicator
matrix across different views and embeds it into a spectral graph term to
preserve the local geometric structure. Comprehensive experimental results on
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of C$^{2}$IMUFS compared with
state-of-the-art methods.

their own distinctive signatures in light of the underlying equations of state

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2203.12163",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The increasing number and scale of federated learning (FL) jobs necessitates
resource efficient scheduling and management of aggregation to make the
economics of cloud-hosted aggregation work. Existing FL research has focused on
the design of FL algorithms and optimization, and less on the efficacy of
aggregation. Existing FL platforms often employ aggregators that actively wait
for model updates. This wastes computational resources on the cloud, especially
in large scale FL settings where parties are intermittently available for
training.
  In this paper, we propose a new FL aggregation paradigm -- ""just-in-time""
(JIT) aggregation that leverages unique properties of FL jobs, especially the
periodicity of model updates, to defer aggregation as much as possible and free
compute resources for other FL jobs or other datacenter workloads. We describe
a novel way to prioritize FL jobs for aggregation, and demonstrate using
multiple datasets, models and FL aggregation algorithms that our techniques can
reduce resource usage by 60+\% when compared to eager aggregation used in
existing FL platforms. We also demonstrate that using JIT aggregation has
negligible overhead and impact on the latency of the FL job.

  Roadmap",,,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sensors are one of the most pervasive and integral components of today's
safety-critical systems. Sensors serve as a bridge between physical quantities
and connected systems. The connected systems with sensors blindly believe the
sensor as there is no way to authenticate the signal coming from a sensor. This
could be an entry point for an attacker. An attacker can inject a fake input
signal along with the legitimate signal by using a suitable spoofing technique.
As the sensor's transducer is not smart enough to differentiate between a fake
and legitimate signal, the injected fake signal eventually can collapse the
connected system. This type of attack is known as the transduction attack. Over
the last decade, several works have been published to provide a defense against
the transduction attack. However, the defenses are proposed on an ad-hoc basis;
hence, they are not well-structured. Our work begins to fill this gap by
providing a checklist that a defense technique should always follow to be
considered as an ideal defense against the transduction attack. We name this
checklist as the Golden reference of sensor defense. We provide insights on how
this Golden reference can be achieved and argue that sensors should be
redesigned from the transducer level to the sensor electronics level. We point
out that only hardware or software modification is not enough; instead, a
hardware/software (HW/SW) co-design approach is required to ride on this future

  Grasping","11 pages, 11 figures, accepted by T-Mech",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Picking up transparent objects is still a challenging task for robots. The
visual properties of transparent objects such as reflection and refraction make
the current grasping methods that rely on camera sensing fail to detect and
localise them. However, humans can handle the transparent object well by first
observing its coarse profile and then poking an area of interest to get a fine
profile for grasping. Inspired by this, we propose a novel framework of
vision-guided tactile poking for transparent objects grasping. In the proposed
framework, a segmentation network is first used to predict the horizontal upper
regions named as poking regions, where the robot can poke the object to obtain
a good tactile reading while leading to minimal disturbance to the object's
state. A poke is then performed with a high-resolution GelSight tactile sensor.
Given the local profiles improved with the tactile reading, a heuristic grasp
is planned for grasping the transparent object. To mitigate the limitations of
real-world data collection and labelling for transparent objects, a large-scale
realistic synthetic dataset was constructed. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our proposed segmentation network can predict the potential poking region
with a high mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.360, and the vision-guided
tactile poking can enhance the grasping success rate significantly from 38.9%
to 85.2%. Thanks to its simplicity, our proposed approach could also be adopted
by other force or tactile sensors and could be used for grasping of other
challenging objects. All the materials used in this paper are available at

poor privacy. We propose a novel approach to release spatio-temporal data

non-singularity of the linear system, despite strong numerical evidences. By

degradation in the presence of Non-IID data distributions of participants. When
the distribution of each local dataset is highly different from the global one,
the local objective of each client will be inconsistent with the global optima
which incur a drift in the local updates. This phenomenon highly impacts the
performance of clients. This is while the primary incentive for clients to
participate in federated learning is to obtain better personalized models. To
address the above-mentioned issue, we present a new algorithm, FLIS, which
groups the clients population in clusters with jointly trainable data
distributions by leveraging the inference similarity of clients' models. This
framework captures settings where different groups of users have their own
objectives (learning tasks) but by aggregating their data with others in the
same cluster (same learning task) to perform more efficient and personalized
federated learning. We present experimental results to demonstrate the benefits
of FLIS over the state-of-the-art benchmarks on CIFAR-100/10, SVHN, and FMNIST

avoids artifacts when using explanation methods. Still, when evaluating such

mechanical phenomena might be simulated by classical statistical model as

entanglement and superposition of states. Therefore coupled epidemic models
expressed by classical systems in terms of classical physics can be the base
for possible incorporation of quantum technologies and in particular for
quantum like computation and quantum like communication. The classical density
matrix is derived and described by the equation of motion in terms of
anticommutator. Existence of Rabi like oscillations is pointed in classical
epidemic model. Furthermore the existence of Aharonov-Bohm effect in quantum

unattainable by endowing optical fields with conventional angular dispersion.
Because these novel features are retained in principle even when the specific
non-differentiable frequency is not part of the selected spectrum, the question
arises as to the impact of the proximity of the spectrum to this frequency. We
show here that operating in the vicinity of the non-differentiable frequency is
imperative to reduce the deleterious impact of (1) errors in implementing the
angular-dispersion profile, and (2) the spectral uncertainty intrinsic to
finite-energy wave packets in any realistic system. Non-differential angular
dispersion can then be viewed as a resource -- quantified by a Schmidt number
-- that is maximized in the vicinity of the non-differentiable frequency. These
results will be useful in designing novel phase-matching of nonlinear
interactions in dispersive media.

applied in various real-world scenarios. However, in recent years, compelling
evidence emerges that the performance of GNN-based node classification may
deteriorate substantially by topological perturbation, such as random
connections or adversarial attacks. Various solutions, such as topological
denoising methods and mechanism design methods, have been proposed to develop
robust GNN-based node classifiers but none of these works can fully address the
problems related to topological perturbations. Recently, the Bayesian label
transition model is proposed to tackle this issue but its slow convergence may
lead to inferior performance. In this work, we propose a new label inference
model, namely LInDT, which integrates both Bayesian label transition and
topology-based label propagation for improving the robustness of GNNs against
topological perturbations. LInDT is superior to existing label transition
methods as it improves the label prediction of uncertain nodes by utilizing
neighborhood-based label propagation leading to better convergence of label
inference. Besides, LIndT adopts asymmetric Dirichlet distribution as a prior,
which also helps it to improve label inference. Extensive experiments on five

high capacitance of the non-ferroelectric, interfacial, insulating layers of
nanoscale thickness that bound the $N_F$ material in typical cells. We analyze
a parallel-plate cell filled with $N_F$ material of high-polarization
$\mathbf{P}$, oriented parallel to the plates at zero applied voltage.
Minimization of the dominant electrostatic energy renders $\mathbf{P}$
spatially uniform and orients it to make the electric field in the $N_F$ as
small as possible, a condition under which the voltage applied to the cell
appears almost entirely across the high-capacity interfacial layers. This
coupling of orientation and charge creates a combined polarization-external
capacitance (PCG) Goldstone reorientation mode requiring applied voltages
orders of magnitude smaller than that of the $N_F$ layer alone to effectively
transport charge across the $N_F$ layer. The $N_F$ layer acts as a low-value
resistor and the interfacial capacitors as reversible energy storage
reservoirs, lowering the restoring force (mass) of the PCG mode and producing
strong reactive dielectric behavior. Analysis of data from several experiments
on ferroelectric liquid crystals (chiral smectics C, bent-core smectics, and

deriving $\epsilon$ values from electrical impedance measurements of

learning model's predictions. Early warning systems in hospitals, for example,
let clinicians improve their patients' outcomes by accurately predicting
infections. While early classification systems are advancing rapidly, a major
gap remains: existing systems do not consider irregular time series, which have
uneven and often-long gaps between their observations. Such series are
notoriously pervasive in impactful domains like healthcare. We bridge this gap
and study early classification of irregular time series, a new setting for
early classifiers that opens doors to more real-world problems. Our solution,
Stop&Hop, uses a continuous-time recurrent network to model ongoing irregular
time series in real time, while an irregularity-aware halting policy, trained
with reinforcement learning, predicts when to stop and classify the streaming
series. By taking real-valued step sizes, the halting policy flexibly decides
exactly when to stop ongoing series in real time. This way, Stop&Hop seamlessly
integrates information contained in the timing of observations, a new and vital
source for early classification in this setting, with the time series values to
provide early classifications for irregular time series. Using four synthetic
and three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Stop&Hop consistently makes
earlier and more-accurate predictions than state-of-the-art alternatives

primary mode of day-to-day communication. However, finding resources to learn
or improve one's lipreading skills can be challenging. This is further
exacerbated in the COVID19 pandemic due to restrictions on direct interactions
with peers and speech therapists. Today, online MOOCs platforms like Coursera
and Udemy have become the most effective form of training for many types of
skill development. However, online lipreading resources are scarce as creating
such resources is an extensive process needing months of manual effort to
record hired actors. Because of the manual pipeline, such platforms are also
limited in vocabulary, supported languages, accents, and speakers and have a
high usage cost. In this work, we investigate the possibility of replacing real
human talking videos with synthetically generated videos. Synthetic data can
easily incorporate larger vocabularies, variations in accent, and even local
languages and many speakers. We propose an end-to-end automated pipeline to
develop such a platform using state-of-the-art talking head video generator

perform an extensive human evaluation using carefully thought out lipreading
exercises to validate the quality of our designed platform against the existing

approach in developing a large-scale lipreading MOOC platform that can impact
millions of people with hearing loss.

Generally, the particle distribution is different in the bulk compared to near

speed, but in the presence of an orienting field, particles rotate to align
with the field and accumulate downstream in the field direction. At the walls,
particles tend to accumulate pointing into the walls and thereby exert pressure
on walls. But the presence of strong orienting fields can cause the particles
to reorient away from the walls, and hence shows a possible mechanism for
preventing contamination of surfaces. The pressure at the walls depends on the

manageable.
  To address these challenges, we introduce Zeno, a new capability-based

Symmetry breaking gives rise to the standard model quarks and leptons of three

and scalable deep learning framework for genome-wide nucleotide-resolution SSB
site prediction. We demonstrated that SSBlazer can accurately predict SSB sites
and sufficiently alleviate false positives by constructing an imbalanced
dataset to simulate the realistic SSB distribution. The model interpretation
analysis reveals that SSBlazer captures the pattern of individual CpG in
genomic context and the motif of TGCC in the center region as critical
features. Besides, SSBlazer is a lightweight model with robust cross-species
generalization ability in the cross-species evaluation, which enables the
large-scale genome-wide application in diverse species. Strikingly, the
putative SSB genomic landscapes of 216 vertebrates reveal a negative
correlation between SSB frequency and evolutionary hierarchy, suggesting that
the genome tends to be integrity during evolution.

overcome this computational hardness, in this paper we employ a
convolution-smoothed technique to CQR, complemented with iteratively reweighted
$\ell_1$-regularization. The smoothed composite loss function is convex, twice
continuously differentiable, and locally strong convex with high probability.
We propose a gradient-based algorithm for penalized smoothed CQR via a variant

These contributions are observed to appreciably modify the open charm meson

computational efficiency. The simulations clearly show the benefits of our

This is because the costs of pack operations are high and frequent boundary

matrices into blocks to alleviate boundary processing. This stage utilizes an
input-aware adaptive tile algorithm and plays the role of runtime tuning. In
the install-time stage, IAAT auto-generates hundreds of kernels of different

small GEMM by invoking different kernels, which corresponds to the size of

applications, because label noise directly leads to the poor generalization of

the ground-truth classes of the training data are balanced. However, the
real-world data is often imbalanced, leading to the inconsistency between
observed and intrinsic class distribution due to label noises. Distribution
inconsistency makes the problem of label-noise learning more challenging
because it is hard to distinguish clean samples from noisy samples on the
intrinsic tail classes. In this paper, we propose a learning framework for
label-noise learning with intrinsically long-tailed data. Specifically, we
propose a robust sample selection method called two-stage bi-dimensional sample
selection (TBSS) to better separate clean samples from noisy samples,
especially for the tail classes. TBSS consists of two new separation metrics to
jointly separate samples in each class. Extensive experiments on multiple
noisy-labeled datasets with intrinsically long-tailed class distribution
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

detection and evaluation (BDE) catch many people's attention. Especially, the

The QCGAN applies the quantum-classical hybrid architecture, namely, a quantum

parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), and the $D_C$ is a classical neural
network. The $G_Q$ is used to generate negative samples to solve the imbalance
problem of positive and negative samples. Then the $G_Q$ and $D_C$ are
optimized by gradient descent. Through simulation tests and analysis, the QBDE

integrating a registration loss and a model fitting quality loss. We
demonstrated the added-value of qDWI-morph over: 1) a baseline qDWI analysis

system is able to actively and dynamically elicit user preference via
conversational interactions. To achieve this, the system periodically queries
users' preference on attributes and collects their feedback. However, most
existing conversational recommender systems only enable the user to provide
absolute feedback to the attributes. In practice, the absolute feedback is
usually limited, as the users tend to provide biased feedback when expressing
the preference. Instead, the user is often more inclined to express comparative
preferences, since user preferences are inherently relative. To enable users to
provide comparative preferences during conversational interactions, we propose
a novel comparison-based conversational recommender system. The relative
feedback, though more practical, is not easy to be incorporated since its
feedback scale is always mismatched with users' absolute preferences. With
effectively collecting and understanding the relative feedback from an

RelativeConUCB. The experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
validate the advantage of our proposed method, compared to the existing bandit

on algorithmic bioinformatics, because it underlies the FM-index and thus
important tools such as Bowtie and BWA. Its admirers consider the BWT a thing
of beauty but, despite thousands of pages being written about it over nearly
thirty years, to undergraduates seeing it for the first time it still often
seems like magic. Some who persevere are later shown the Positional BWT (PBWT),
which was published twenty years after the BWT. In this paper we argue that the
PBWT should be taught {\em before} the BWT.
  We first use the PBWT's close relation to a right-to-left radix sort to
explain how to use it as a fast and space-efficient index for {\em positional
search} on a set of strings (that is, given a pattern and a position, quickly
list the strings containing that pattern starting in that position). We then
observe that {\em prefix search} (listing all the strings that start with the
pattern) is an easy special case of positional search, and that prefix search
on the suffixes of a single string is equivalent to {\em substring search} in
that string (listing all the starting positions of occurrences of the pattern
in the string).
  Storing na\""ively a PBWT of the suffixes of a string is space-{\em
inefficient} but, in even reasonably small examples, most of its columns are
nearly the same. It is not difficult to show that if we store a PBWT of the
cyclic shifts of the string, instead of its suffixes, then all the columns are
exactly the same -- and equal to the BWT of the string. Thus we can teach the
BWT and the FM-index via the PBWT.

modalities. Contrastive learning has been adopted by most prior arts. Except
for limited amount of negative image-text pairs, the capability of constrastive
learning is restricted by manually weighting negative pairs as well as
unawareness of external knowledge. In this paper, we propose our novel Coupled
Diversity-Sensitive Momentum Constrastive Learning (CODER) for improving

diversity-sensitiveness is achieved by adaptive negative pair weighting.
Furthermore, two branches are designed in CODER. One learns instance-level
embeddings from image/text, and it also generates pseudo online clustering
labels for its input image/text based on their embeddings. Meanwhile, the other
branch learns to query from commonsense knowledge graph to form concept-level
descriptors for both modalities. Afterwards, both branches leverage DCL to
align the cross-modal embedding spaces while an extra pseudo clustering label
prediction loss is utilized to promote concept-level representation learning
for the second branch. Extensive experiments conducted on two popular
benchmarks, i.e. MSCOCO and Flicker30K, validate CODER remarkably outperforms
the state-of-the-art approaches.

Existing VI-ReID methods mainly focus on learning general features across

uses a lightweight Knowledge Capturing Module (KCM) to capture rich semantics

Afterwards, a Discrepancy Modeling Module (DMM) is deployed to transform these
features into neutral ones according to the modality-irrelevant prototypes. To
ensure feature discriminability, another two KCMs are further deployed for
feature cycle constructions. With cycle construction, our method can learn
effective neutral features for visible and infrared images while preserving
their salient semantics. Extensive experiments on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets

models. However, even a weak autoregressive decoder has the bypass effect on
the encoder. More importantly, the discriminative ability of learned

propose a contrastive pre-training approach to learn a discriminative

idea is to generate word distributions of input text in a non-autoregressive

close while pushing away from others. We theoretically show that our
contrastive strategy can suppress the common words and highlight the

model size and the number of tasks increase greatly, such approach becomes less
feasible and prohibitively expensive. Recently, a variety of
parameter-efficient tuning methods have been proposed in natural language
processing (NLP) that only fine-tune a small number of parameters while still
attaining strong performance. Yet there has been little effort to explore
parameter-efficient tuning for IR.
  In this work, we first conduct a comprehensive study of existing
parameter-efficient tuning methods at both the retrieval and re-ranking stages.
Unlike the promising results in NLP, we find that these methods cannot achieve
comparable performance to full fine-tuning at both stages when updating less
than 1\% of the original model parameters. More importantly, we find that the
existing methods are just parameter-efficient, but not learning-efficient as
they suffer from unstable training and slow convergence. To analyze the
underlying reason, we conduct a theoretical analysis and show that the
separation of the inserted trainable modules makes the optimization difficult.
To alleviate this issue, we propose to inject additional modules alongside the
\acp{PTM} to make the original scattered modules connected. In this way, all
the trainable modules can form a pathway to smooth the loss surface and thus
help stabilize the training process. Experiments at both retrieval and

defocus estimation to get better results in the weak texture region and the
defocus estimation facilitates the depth estimation by the strong physical

which is the first all-real image dataset consisting of 100K sets of
all-in-focus images, focused images with focus depth, depth maps, and defocus

setting where users wish to compute a function over some secret inputs by
submitting the computation to a set of nodes, without revealing them those
inputs. FMPC offloads most of the computational complexity to the end users,
and includes an online phase that mainly consists of each node locally
evaluating specific functions. FMPC paves the way for a new kind of multiparty

multiplication of secrets stepping away from circuit garbling and the
traditional algebra introduced by Donald Beaver in 1991. Our protocol is
capable to compute addition and multiplication with no communication and its

for determining the chaotic or regular nature of orbits in a system's phase
space, which are based on the values of the LDs of these orbits and of nearby
ones: The difference (DNLD) and ratio (RNLD) of neighboring orbits' LDs. We
find that, typically, these indicators are able to correctly characterize the
chaotic or regular nature of orbits to better than 90 % agreement with results
obtained by implementing the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI) method, which is a
well established chaos detection technique. Further investigating the
performance of the two introduced quantities we discuss the effects of the
total integration time and of the spacing between the used neighboring orbits
on the accuracy of the methods, finding that even typical short time, coarse
grid LD computations are sufficient to provide a reliable quantification of a
system's chaotic component, using less CPU time than the SALI. In addition to
quantifying chaos, the introduced indicators have the ability to reveal details
about the systems' local and global chaotic phase space structure. Our findings
clearly suggest that LDs can also be used to quantify and investigate chaos in

$\sim 57 \%$. While there is no significant difference between the RL and

Eddington ratio, and covering fraction (CF), optical continuum luminosity of
the RL quasars are higher. The similarity in the distribution of their CF
indicates that our analysis is unbiased in terms of the viewing angle of the
HBL RL and RQ quasars. Hence, we conclude that the accretion disc luminosity of
the RL quasars in our HBL sample is higher, which indicates a connection
between a brighter disc and a more prominent jet. By comparing them with the
non-HBL H$\beta$ broad emission line quasars, we find that the HBL sources have
the lowest Eddington ratios in addition to having a very high RLF. That is
consistent with the theories of jet formation, in which jets are launched from
low Eddington ratio accreting systems. We find that the [O III] narrow emission
line is stronger in the RL compared to RQ quasars in our HBL sample, which is
consistent with previous findings in the literature, and may be caused by the

developers. However, recently, a new paradigm called user-side recommender
systems has been proposed and they enable web service users to construct their
own recommender systems without access to trade-secret data. This approach
opens the door to user-defined fair systems even if the official recommender
system of the service is not fair. While existing methods for user-side
recommender systems have addressed the challenging problem of building
recommender systems without using log data, they rely on heuristic approaches,
and it is still unclear whether constructing user-side recommender systems is a
well-defined problem from theoretical point of view. In this paper, we provide
theoretical justification of user-side recommender systems. Specifically, we
see that hidden item features can be recovered from the information available
to the user, making the construction of user-side recommender system
well-defined. However, this theoretically grounded approach is not efficient.
To realize practical yet theoretically sound recommender systems, we propose
three desirable properties of user-side recommender systems and propose an
effective and efficient user-side recommender system, \textsc{Consul}, based on
these foundations. We prove that \textsc{Consul} satisfies all three
properties, whereas existing user-side recommender systems lack at least one of
them. In the experiments, we empirically validate the theory of feature
recovery via numerical experiments. We also show that our proposed method
achieves an excellent trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency and
demonstrate via case studies that the proposed method can retrieve information
that the provider's official recommender system cannot.

while respecting the capacity constraints. We define two modes of travel: (1)
servicing and (2) deadheading, which correspond to whether a robot is
performing task-specific actions or not. Our formulation allows separate and

leading order term is given by a kink-wave that is determined by the total

more popular, methods for surrogate evaluation using them are needed. These
studies also offer a rich data resource for surrogate evaluation that would not
normally be possible. However, they also offer a set of statistical issues
including heterogeneity of the study population, treatments, implementation,

flexibly model relationships between the treatment effect on the surrogate and
the treatment effect on the outcome and also to identify potential clusters

interactions. Here, we perform extensive analyses on a large dataset of protein
complexes for which both experimental binding affinity and pH data were
available. We found that (i) although different classes of dimers do not
present marked differences in the amino acid composition and charges
disposition in the binding region, (ii) homodimers with identical binding
region show higher electrostatic compatibility with respect to both homodimers
with non-identical binding region and heterodimers. The level of electrostatic
compatibility also varies with the pH of the complex, reaching the lowest
values for low pH. Interestingly, (iii) shape and electrostatic complementarity
behave oppositely when one stratifies the complexes by their binding affinity.
Conversely, complexes with low values of binding affinity exploit Coulombic
complementarity to acquire specificity, suggesting that electrostatic
complementarity may play a greater role in transient (or less stable)
complexes. In light of these results, (iv) we provide a fast and efficient
method to measure electrostatic complementarity without the need of knowing the
complex structure. Expanding the electrostatic potential on a basis of 2D
orthogonal polynomials, we can discriminate between transient and permanent
protein complexes with an AUC of the ROC of 0.8.

adopted in a wide range of applications. Due to their non-linearity,
Sigmoid-like activation functions are usually over-approximated for efficient
verification, which inevitably introduces imprecision. Considerable efforts
have been devoted to finding the so-called tighter approximations to obtain
more precise verification results. However, existing tightness definitions are
heuristic and lack theoretical foundations. We conduct a thorough empirical
analysis of existing neuron-wise characterizations of tightness and reveal that
they are superior only on specific neural networks. We then introduce the
notion of network-wise tightness as a unified tightness definition and show
that computing network-wise tightness is a complex non-convex optimization
problem. We bypass the complexity from different perspectives via two
efficient, provably tightest approximations. The results demonstrate the
promising performance achievement of our approaches over state of the art: (i)
achieving up to 251.28% improvement to certified lower robustness bounds; and
(ii) exhibiting notably more precise verification results on convolutional

gas motion displayed by the branch structures is in agreement with the Larson

turbulence. The transition to transonic/subsonic gas motion is seen to occur at

two-color near-infrared pulse lasers into a vacuum along a common optical axis.
Within the focused quasi-parallel collision system created by combining a
creation field ($2.5\,\mathrm{mJ}/47\,\mathrm{fs}$ Ti:Sapphire laser) and a
background inducing field ($1.5\,\mathrm{mJ}/9\,\mathrm{ns}$ Nd:YAG laser), the
detection of signal photons via stimulated resonant photon-photon scattering by
exchanging ALPs was attempted in a vacuum chamber. The signal wavelength can be
determined via energy-momentum conservation in the vacuum, and it coincides
with that determined from the atomic four-wave-mixing (aFWM) process. In this
work, the pulse energies were one order of magnitude higher than those in the
previous search, allowing aFWM from optical elements to be observed as a
pressure-independent background for the first time, in addition to the
residual-gas-originating aFWM following a quadratic pressure dependence. In
principle the four-wave-mixing process in vacuum via ALP exchanges (vFWM) must
also be pressure-independent, so the development of a new method for
discriminating the optical-element aFWM is indispensable for increasing the
pulse energies to the values needed for future upgraded searches. In this
paper, we will present the established method for quantifying the yield from
the optical-element aFWM process based on the beam cross-section dependence.
With the new method, the number of signal photons was found to be consistent
with zero. We then successfully obtained a new exclusion region in the relation
between ALP-photon coupling, $g/M$, and the ALP mass $m$, reaching the most

would gradually memorize the label noise and impair model performance. To
relieve this issue, curriculum learning is proposed to improve model
performance and generalization by ordering training samples in a meaningful
(e.g., easy to hard) sequence. Previous work takes incorrect samples as generic
hard ones without discriminating between hard samples (i.e., hard samples in
correct data) and incorrect samples. Indeed, a model should learn from hard
samples to promote generalization rather than overfit to incorrect ones. In
this paper, we address this problem by appending a novel loss function
DiscrimLoss, on top of the existing task loss. Its main effect is to
automatically and stably estimate the importance of easy samples and difficult
samples (including hard and incorrect samples) at the early stages of training
to improve the model performance. Then, during the following stages,
DiscrimLoss is dedicated to discriminating between hard and incorrect samples
to improve the model generalization. Such a training strategy can be formulated
dynamically in a self-supervised manner, effectively mimicking the main
principle of curriculum learning. Experiments on image classification, image

the versatility and effectiveness of our method, particularly in the presence

of particular concern, which refers to the possibility of malicious clients
participating in the learning process. Hence, a crucial objective in FL is to
neutralize the potential impact of Byzantine attacks, and to ensure that the
final model is trustable. It has been observed that the higher the variance
among the clients' models/updates, the more space there is for Byzantine
attacks to be hidden. As a consequence, by utilizing momentum, and thus,
reducing the variance, it is possible to weaken the strength of known Byzantine
attacks. The centered clipping (CC) framework has further shown that, the
momentum term from the previous iteration, besides reducing the variance, can
be used as a reference point to neutralize Byzantine attacks better. In this

Classical correspondence matching approaches are designed to withstand scaling
and rotation transformations. However, the features extracted using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are only translation-equivariant to a
certain extent. Recently, researchers have strived to improve the
rotation-equivariance of CNNs based on group theories. Sim(2) is the group of
similarity transformations in the 2D plane. This paper presents a specialized
dataset dedicated to evaluating sim(2)-equivariant correspondence matching
algorithms. We compare the performance of 16 state-of-the-art (SoTA)
correspondence matching approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the
importance of group equivariant algorithms for correspondence matching on
various sim(2) transformation conditions. Since the subpixel accuracy achieved
by CNN-based correspondence matching approaches is unsatisfactory, this
specific area requires more attention in future works. Our dataset is publicly

theoretical embarrassment to $L$-smooth condition (i.e., assuming the gradient
is globally Lipschitz continuous with constant $L$) adopted by literature,
which has been pointed out to often fail in practical neural networks. To
tackle this embarrassment, we analyze the convergence of Adam under a relaxed
condition called $(L_0,L_1)$ smoothness condition, which allows the gradient
Lipschitz constant to change with the local gradient norm. $(L_0,L_1)$ is
strictly weaker than $L$-smooth condition and it has been empirically verified
to hold for practical deep neural networks. Under the $(L_0,L_1)$ smoothness
condition, we establish the convergence for Adam with practical
hyperparameters. Specifically, we argue that Adam can adapt to the local
smoothness condition, justifying the \emph{adaptivity} of Adam. In contrast,
SGD can be arbitrarily slow under this condition. Our result might shed light
on the benefit of adaptive gradient methods over non-adaptive ones.

deformed mean-field theory, random phase approximation, Luttinger-Tisza method,

incommensurate spin density-wave (SDW) phases with very long spatial periods
which were previously overlooked. The transition to the SDW phases from the
metallic phase is driven by an unprecedented instability that nests the two
parts of the Fermi surface carrying opposite spins. For large SOC, the spiral,
stipe, and vortex phases are obtained, when the four Dirac points exist near
the Fermi level and their whole linear dispersions nest by a wavelength $\pi$,
opening a band gap. These two types of transition provide Fermiology that
distinguishes the antisymmetric SOC systems, generating a variety of magnetic
phases that start from the relatively weak correlation regime and continue to
the strongly interacting limit.

the graph mining community, due to their flexibility in parameterizing graph
neural networks (GNNs) without any label information. The key idea lies in
encoding valuable information into the backbone GNNs, by predicting the masked
graph signals extracted from the input graphs. In order to balance the
importance of diverse graph signals (e.g., nodes, edges, subgraphs), the
existing approaches are mostly hand-engineered by introducing hyperparameters
to re-weight the importance of graph signals. However, human interventions with
sub-optimal hyperparameters often inject additional bias and deteriorate the
generalization performance in the downstream applications. This paper addresses
these limitations from a new perspective, i.e., deriving curriculum for
pre-training GNNs. We propose an end-to-end model named MentorGNN that aims to
supervise the pre-training process of GNNs across graphs with diverse
structures and disparate feature spaces. To comprehend heterogeneous graph
signals at different granularities, we propose a curriculum learning paradigm
that automatically re-weighs graph signals in order to ensure a good
generalization in the target domain. Moreover, we shed new light on the problem
of domain adaption on relational data (i.e., graphs) by deriving a natural and
interpretable upper bound on the generalization error of the pre-trained GNNs.
Extensive experiments on a wealth of real graphs validate and verify the
performance of MentorGNN.

  Perspective","First two authors contributed equally; 29 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose the first unified theoretical analysis of mixed sample data
augmentation (MSDA), such as Mixup and CutMix. Our theoretical results show
that regardless of the choice of the mixing strategy, MSDA behaves as a
pixel-level regularization of the underlying training loss and a regularization
of the first layer parameters. Similarly, our theoretical results support that
the MSDA training strategy can improve adversarial robustness and
generalization compared to the vanilla training strategy. Using the theoretical
results, we provide a high-level understanding of how different design choices
of MSDA work differently. For example, we show that the most popular MSDA
methods, Mixup and CutMix, behave differently, e.g., CutMix regularizes the
input gradients by pixel distances, while Mixup regularizes the input gradients
regardless of pixel distances. Our theoretical results also show that the
optimal MSDA strategy depends on tasks, datasets, or model parameters. From
these observations, we propose generalized MSDAs, a Hybrid version of Mixup and
CutMix (HMix) and Gaussian Mixup (GMix), simple extensions of Mixup and CutMix.
Our implementation can leverage the advantages of Mixup and CutMix, while our
implementation is very efficient, and the computation cost is almost
neglectable as Mixup and CutMix. Our empirical study shows that our HMix and
GMix outperform the previous state-of-the-art MSDA methods in CIFAR-100 and

This is important because differences among groups can be found by chance when

  operators","3 figures",,,,"math.GM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the present manuscript, we present a new sequence of operators, $i.e.$,
$\alpha$-Bernstein-Schurer-Kantorovich operators depending on two parameters
$\alpha\in[0,1]$ and $\rho>0$ for one and two variables to approximate
measurable functions on $[0: 1+q], q>0$. Next, we give basic results and
discuss the rapidity of convergence and order of approximation for univariate
and bivariate of these sequences in their respective sections. Further,
Graphical and numerical analysis are presented. Moreover, local and global
approximation properties are discussed in terms of first and second order
modulus of smoothness, Peetre's K-functional and weight functions for these
sequences in different spaces of functions.

intersections of the half lines starting from the adjacent vertices of a
triangle form an equilateral triangle for an arbitrary triangle, then the half
lines are the angle trisectors. To derive the result we use elementary
trigonometry, Taylor series expansions, and solve systems of polynomial
equations step by step. As a byproduct we get a probably new trigonometric
identity.

Putting specific criteria into a system that provides an early warning of an
imminent at-tack will be advantageous to a better prevention plan for an
upcoming heart attack. Some studies have been conducted for this purpose, but
yet the goal has not been reached to prevent a patient from getting such a
disease. In this paper, Neural Network trained with Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSONN) is used to analyze the input criteria and enhance heart attack
anticipation. A real and novel dataset that has been recorded on the disease is
used. After preprocessing the data, the features are fed into the system. As a
result, the outcomes from PSONN have been evaluated against those from other
algorithms. Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural network trained with
Backpropagation (BPNN), and Naive Bayes were among those employed. Then the
results of 100%, 99.2424%, 99.2323%, 81.3131%, and 66.4141% are produced
concerning the mentioned algorithms, which show that PSONN has recorded the
highest accuracy rate among all other tested algorithms.

  AI-aided Drug Discovery?",,,,,"q-bio.BM cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-supervised pre-training is gaining increasingly more popularity in
AI-aided drug discovery, leading to more and more pre-trained models with the
promise that they can extract better feature representations for molecules.
Yet, the quality of learned representations have not been fully explored. In
this work, inspired by the two phenomena of Activity Cliffs (ACs) and Scaffold
Hopping (SH) in traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR)
analysis, we propose a method named Representation-Property Relationship
Analysis (RePRA) to evaluate the quality of the representations extracted by
the pre-trained model and visualize the relationship between the
representations and properties. The concepts of ACs and SH are generalized from
the structure-activity context to the representation-property context, and the
underlying principles of RePRA are analyzed theoretically. Two scores are
designed to measure the generalized ACs and SH detected by RePRA, and therefore
the quality of representations can be evaluated. In experiments,
representations of molecules from 10 target tasks generated by 7 pre-trained
models are analyzed. The results indicate that the state-of-the-art pre-trained
models can overcome some shortcomings of canonical Extended-Connectivity
FingerPrints (ECFP), while the correlation between the basis of the
representation space and specific molecular substructures are not explicit.
Thus, some representations could be even worse than the canonical fingerprints.
Our method enables researchers to evaluate the quality of molecular
representations generated by their proposed self-supervised pre-trained models.
And our findings can guide the community to develop better pre-training
techniques to regularize the occurrence of ACs and SH.

  Learning for linguistic, visual, acoustic Representations","Accepted by IJCNN 2022",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multimodal sentiment analysis has become an increasingly popular research
area as the demand for multimodal online content is growing. For multimodal
sentiment analysis, words can have different meanings depending on the
linguistic context and non-verbal information, so it is crucial to understand
the meaning of the words accordingly. In addition, the word meanings should be
interpreted within the whole utterance context that includes nonverbal
information. In this paper, we present a Context-driven Modality Shifting BERT
with Contrastive Learning for linguistic, visual, acoustic Representations
(CMSBERT-CLR), which incorporates the whole context's non-verbal and verbal
information and aligns modalities more effectively through contrastive
learning. First, we introduce a Context-driven Modality Shifting (CMS) to
incorporate the non-verbal and verbal information within the whole context of
the sentence utterance. Then, for improving the alignment of different
modalities within a common embedding space, we apply contrastive learning.
Furthermore, we use an exponential moving average parameter and label smoothing
as optimization strategies, which can make the convergence of the network more
stable and increase the flexibility of the alignment. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results.
