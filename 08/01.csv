their rich physics and potential opportunities for new and enhanced
functionalities. In this context, the duality of space and time in wave physics
has been particularly fruitful to uncover interesting physical effects in the
temporal domain, such as reflection/refraction at temporal interfaces and
momentum-bandgaps in time crystals. However, the characteristics of the
temporal/frequency dimension, particularly its relation to causality and energy
conservation ($\hbar \omega$ is energy, whereas $\hbar \boldsymbol{k}$ is
momentum), create challenges and constraints that are unique to time-varying
systems and are not present in their spatially varying counterparts. Here, we
overview two key physical aspects of time-varying photonics that have only
received marginal attention so far, namely temporal dispersion and external
power requirements, and explore their implications. We discuss how temporal
dispersion, an inherent property of any causal material, makes the fields
evolve continuously at sharp temporal interfaces and may limit the strength of
fast temporal modulations and of various resulting effects. Furthermore, we
show that changing the refractive index in time always involves large amounts
of energy. We derive power requirements to observe a time-crystal response in
one of the most popular material platforms in time-varying photonics, i.e.,
transparent conducting oxides, and we argue that these effects are almost
always obscured by less exotic nonlinear phenomena. These observations and
findings shed light on the physics and constraints of time-varying photonics,
and may guide the design and implementation of future time-modulated photonic
systems.

report that Volta phase-plate phase-contrast is less sensitive than
non-phase-plate phase contrast, which leads to conventional defocusing
phase-contrast. What about Hilbert phase-plate phase-contrast? We report that
the Hilbert phase-plate method can survive if two experiments using a pair of
symmetric Hilbert phase-plates, of which phase is set to a value smaller than
{\pi}, are combined. Three phase-contrast methods using the symmetric Hilbert
phase-plates and Zernike phase-plate representing Volta phase-plate and
Scherzer defocus respectively were compared in sensitivity theoretically
relying on a contrast transfer theory and computationally on a simulator
specifically designed for phase plate transmission electron microscopy. For the
two phase-plate phase-contrasts, the phase that gives the highest sensitivity
was searched for by changing the phase-plate phase. As a result, the symmetric
Hilbert phase-plates phase-contrast was found to outperform Scherzer defocus
phase-contrast in the phase around {\pi}/2. On the other hand, Zernike
phase-plate phase-contrast was found considerably inferior to Scherzer defocus
phase-contrast in the entire phase range from 0 to {\pi}. Furthermore, the
novel Hilbert phase-plate method was compared with complex observation
transmission electron microscopy, which also requires two experiments, and the
origin of the higher sensitivity of symmetric Hilbert phase-plates
phase-contrast was examined.

problem that has drawn a lot of attention in recent years. Many calibration
methods of varying complexity have been proposed for the task, but there is no
consensus about how expressive these should be. We focus on the task of
confidence scaling, specifically on post-hoc methods that generalize
Temperature Scaling, we call these the Adaptive Temperature Scaling family. We
analyse expressive functions that improve calibration and propose interpretable
methods. We show that when there is plenty of data complex models like neural
networks yield better performance, but are prone to fail when the amount of
data is limited, a common situation in certain post-hoc calibration
applications like medical diagnosis. We study the functions that expressive
methods learn under ideal conditions and design simpler methods but with a
strong inductive bias towards these well-performing functions. Concretely, we
propose Entropy-based Temperature Scaling, a simple method that scales the
confidence of a prediction according to its entropy. Results show that our
method obtains state-of-the-art performance when compared to others and, unlike
complex models, it is robust against data scarcity. Moreover, our proposed

make this assumption unnecessary, by incorporating one's doubts about the
assumption into the assessment. We derive conservative confidence bounds on a
system's probability of failure on demand (pfd), when operational testing
reveals no failures. The generality and utility of the confidence bounds are
illustrated in the assessment of a nuclear power-plant safety-protection
system, under varying levels of skepticism about the i.i.d. assumption. The
analysis suggests that the i.i.d. assumption can make Bayesian reliability
assessments extremely optimistic - such assessments do not explicitly account
for how software can be very likely to exhibit no failures during extensive
operational testing despite the software's pfd being undesirably large.

shown that for a larger vector coupling constant, the equation of state of the

will be greater. Using the resulting hybrid equations of state, the TOV
equations are integrated numerically and the mass and radius of the compact

shown that when $G_V$ is larger, the maximum mass of the compact star will be

smaller. Questions of the stability of hybrid stars are also discussed. It is
shown that in terms of the model examined here, for all values of the vector

context of hot Jupiter atmospheres. Here we provide an overview of the
abundances of sulfur-bearing species in hot Jupiter atmospheres under different
conditions and explore their observability. We use the photochemical kinetics
code VULCAN to model hot Jupiter atmospheric disequilibrium chemistry.
Transmission spectra for these atmospheres are created using the modelling
framework ARCiS. We vary model parameters such as the diffusion coefficient,
and we study the importance of photochemistry on the resulting mixing ratios.
Furthermore, we vary the chemical composition of the atmosphere by increasing
the metallicity from solar to ~10 times solar. We also explore different C/O
ratios. We find that H2S and SO2 are the best candidates for detection between
1 and 10 micron, using a spectral resolution that is representative of the
instruments on board the JWST. H2S is easiest to detect at an equilibrium
temperature of ~1500 K and C/O ratios between 0.7 and 0.9, with the ideal value
increasing slightly for increasing metallicity. SO2 is most likely to be
detected at an equilibrium temperature of ~1000 K at low C/O ratios and high
metallicities. Nevertheless, among these two molecules, we expect SO2 detection
to be more common, as it is detectable in scenarios more favoured by formation
models. We conclude that H2S and SO2 will most likely be detected in the coming
years with the JWST and that the detection of these species will provide

various carcinomas namely, gastric cancer (GC), nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC),
Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). Using the community

functional enrichment using over-representation analysis methodology. In this
study, we identified the modular communities to explore the relation of this
common causative pathogen (EBV) with different carcinomas such as GC, NPC, HL

GSTP1, CSF3, GATA3, UBR5, AXIN2 and POLE based on their degree of distribution.
Further over-representation analysis showed that the ABL1 gene was

we show how the compensation approach introduced in the 90ies by Adan, Wessels
and Zijm may be applied to compute positive harmonic functions with Dirichlet
boundary conditions. In particular, in case the random walks have a drift with
positive coordinates, we derive an explicit formula for the escape probability,
which is the probability to tend to infinity without reaching the boundary
axes. These formulas typically involve famous recurrent sequences, such as the
Fibonacci numbers. As a second step, we propose a probabilistic interpretation
of the previously constructed harmonic functions and prove that they allow to
compute all positive harmonic functions of these singular walks. To that
purpose, we derive the asymptotics of the Green functions in all directions of
the quarter plane and use Martin boundary theory.

communicate with citizens ahead of time. Today, social media is used by
hundreds of thousands of political groups and politicians. On these social
media networks, every politician and political party has millions of followers,
and politicians find new and innovative ways to urge individuals to participate
in politics. Furthermore, social media assists politicians in various
decision-making processes by providing recommendations, such as developing
policies and strategies based on previous experiences, recommending and
selecting suitable candidates for a particular constituency, recommending a
suitable person for a particular position in the party, and launching a
political campaign based on citizen sentiments on various issues and
controversies, among other things. This research is a review on the use of

transmission of information from a sender to a distant receiver by routing
packets of data through many intermediate nodes. Classically, each packet has
to follow a well-defined path through the network. In a quantum network,
however, it is in principle possible to route information along multiple paths
in a coherent quantum superposition. Here we develop a model of quantum
communication network with coherent routing of information through multiple
intermediate nodes. In this model, we show that the distance over which
information can be transmitted reliably can be significantly extended.
Surprisingly, this improvement takes place also for purely classical channels,
such as binary asymmetric channels. In the ideal setting where the coherent
superposition of paths is not affected by noise, we find that classical data
can be reliably transmitted at a constant rate through asymptotically long
sequences of binary asymmetric channels, which in normal conditions would lead
to an exponential decay of the transmission rate. In more realistic conditions
involving decoherence on the paths, we find that the combined use of coherent
control on the path and local operations at intermediate nodes achieves
significantly higher communication rates over finite distances.

on a parsimonious classification model with uneven accuracy. When local
classification is deemed inaccurate, devices can decide to offload the image to
an edge server with a more accurate but resource-intensive model. Resource
constraints, e.g., network bandwidth, however, require regulating such
transmissions to avoid congestion and high latency. The paper investigates this
offloading problem when transmissions regulation is through a token bucket, a
mechanism commonly used for such purposes. The goal is to devise a lightweight,
online offloading policy that optimizes an application-specific metric (e.g.,
classification accuracy) under the constraints of the token bucket. The paper
develops a policy based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), and demonstrates both its
efficacy and the feasibility of its deployment on embedded devices. Of note is
the fact that the policy can handle complex input patterns, including
correlation in image arrivals and classification accuracy. The evaluation is
carried out by performing image classification over a local testbed using
synthetic traces generated from the ImageNet image classification benchmark.

sparked novel areas of fundamental research. In the field of acoustics,
however, such a generation has not been introduced yet. For numerous
applications, the large spatial extent of surface acoustic waves (SAW) causes
unwanted perturbations and limits the accuracy of physical manipulations.
Particularly, this restriction applies to SAW-driven quantum experiments with
single flying electrons, where extra modulation renders the exact position of
the transported electron ambiguous and leads to undesired spin mixing. Here, we
address this challenge by demonstrating single-shot chirp synthesis of a
strongly compressed acoustic pulse. Employing this solitary SAW pulse to
transport a single electron between distant quantum dots with an efficiency
exceeding 99%, we show that chirp synthesis is competitive with regular
transduction approaches. Performing a time-resolved investigation of the
SAW-driven sending process, we outline the potential of the chirped SAW pulse
to synchronize single-electron transport from many quantum-dot sources. By
superimposing multiple pulses, we further point out the capability of chirp
synthesis to generate arbitrary acoustic waveforms tailorable to a variety of
(opto)nanomechanical applications. Our results shift the paradigm of compressed
pulses to the field of acoustic phonons and pave the way for a SAW-driven
platform of single-electron transport that is precise, synchronized, and

demonstrate the robustness of the predicted flow by direct propagation of

propose DNNSHIELD, a hardware-accelerated defense that adapts the strength of
the response to the confidence of the adversarial input. Our approach relies on
dynamic and random sparsification of the DNN model to achieve inference
approximation efficiently and with fine-grain control over the approximation
error. DNNSHIELD uses the output distribution characteristics of sparsified
inference compared to a dense reference to detect adversarial inputs. We show
an adversarial detection rate of 86% when applied to VGG16 and 88% when applied
to ResNet50, which exceeds the detection rate of the state of the art
approaches, with a much lower overhead. We demonstrate a
software/hardware-accelerated FPGA prototype, which reduces the performance
impact of DNNSHIELD relative to software-only CPU and GPU implementations.

heterostructures is crucial for advancing spin-based electronics. Magnetic
insulators (MIs) can be deposited on TIs using the spin-spray process, which is
a unique non-vacuum, low-temperature growth process. TIs have highly reactive
surfaces that oxidize upon exposure to atmosphere, making it challenging to
grow spin-spray ferrites on TIs. In this work, it is demonstrated that a thin
titanium capping layer on TI, followed by oxidation in atmosphere to produce a
thin TiOx interfacial layer, protects the TI surface, without significantly
compromising spin transport from the magnetic material across the TiOx to the
TI surface states. First, it was demonstrated that in Bi2Te3/TiOx/Ni80Fe20
heterostructures that TiOx provided an excellent barrier against diffusion of
magnetic species, yet maintained a large spin-pumping effect. Second, the TiOx
was also used as a protective capping layer on Bi2Te3, followed by the
spin-spray growth of the MI, NixZnyFe2O4 (NZFO). For the thinnest TiOx
barriers, Bi2Te3/TiOx/NZFO samples had AFM disordered interfacial layer because
of diffusion. With increasing TiOx barrier thickness, the diffusion was
reduced, but still maintained strong interfacial spin-pumping interaction.
These experimental results demonstrate a novel method of low-temperature growth
of magnetic insulators on TIs enabled by interface engineering.

that the model accommodates both Majorana and scalar DM within a significant
viable parameter space, while considering all the relevant theoretical and
experimental constraints such as perturbativity, vacuum stability, unitarity,
the di-photon Higgs decay, electroweak precision tests and lepton flavor
violating constraints. In addition to the collider signatures predicted by the

new ""incomplete"" P-state like structure on the light-front (LF), at extremely
large internal momenta, which can be achieved in high energy transfer
electro-disintegration of the deuteron. Investigating the deuteron on the
light-front, where the vacuum-fluctuations are suppressed, we found that this

of angular condition which can happen only if deuteron contains non-nucleonic

  learning","Ph.D. Thesis",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Recently, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants have become the
dominant methods in the large-scale optimization of machine learning (ML)
problems. A variety of strategies have been proposed for tuning the step sizes,
ranging from adaptive step sizes to heuristic methods to change the step size
in each iteration. Also, momentum has been widely employed in ML tasks to
accelerate the training process. Yet, there is a gap in our theoretical
understanding of them. In this work, we start to close this gap by providing
formal guarantees to a few heuristic optimization methods and proposing
improved algorithms.
  First, we analyze a generalized version of the AdaGrad (Delayed AdaGrad) step
sizes in both convex and non-convex settings, showing that these step sizes
allow the algorithms to automatically adapt to the level of noise of the
stochastic gradients. We show for the first time sufficient conditions for
Delayed AdaGrad to achieve almost sure convergence of the gradients to zero.
Moreover, we present a high probability analysis for Delayed AdaGrad and its
momentum variant in the non-convex setting.
  Second, we analyze SGD with exponential and cosine step sizes, which are
empirically successful but lack theoretical support. We provide the very first
convergence guarantees for them in the smooth and non-convex setting, with and
without the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition. We also show their good
property of adaptivity to noise under the PL condition.
  Third, we study the last iterate of momentum methods. We prove the first
lower bound in the convex setting for the last iterate of SGD with constant
momentum. Moreover, we investigate a class of
Follow-The-Regularized-Leader-based momentum algorithms with increasing
momentum and shrinking updates. We show that their last iterate has optimal
convergence for unconstrained convex stochastic optimization problems.

(OSS) and Open Data (OD), and adopting open collaborative development
practices, platform providers may exploit open innovation benefits. However,
adopting such practices in a traditionally closed organization is a maturity
process that we hypothesize cannot be undergone without friction.
  Objective: This study aims to investigate what challenges may occur for a
newly-turned platform provider in the public sector, aiming to adopt open
collaborative practices to create an ecosystem around the development of the
underpinning platform.
  Method: An exploratory case-study is conducted at a Swedish public sector
platform provider, which is creating an ecosystem around OSS and OD, related to
the labor market. Data is collected through interviews, document studies, and
prolonged engagement.
  Results: Findings highlight a fear among developers of being publicly
questioned for their work, as they represent a government agency undergoing
constant scrutiny. Issue trackers, roadmaps, and development processes are
generally closed, while multiple channels are used for communication, causing
internal and external confusion. Some developers are reluctant to communicate
externally as they believe it interferes with their work. Lack of health
metrics limits possibilities to follow ecosystem growth and for actors to make
investment decisions. Further, an autonomous team structure is reported to
complicate internal communication and enforcement of the common vision, as well
as collaboration. A set of interventions for addressing the challenges are
proposed, based on related work.
  Conclusions: We conclude that several cultural, organizational, and
process-related challenges may reside, and by understanding these early on,
platform providers can be preemptive in their work of building healthy
ecosystems.

therefore the left-over seeds from the previous season during harvest can
continue to grow in the middle of rotation crops like corn (Zea mays L.) and
sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.). These feral or volunteer cotton (VC) plants when
reach the pinhead squaring phase (5-6 leaf stage) can act as hosts for the boll

to locate and eliminate VC plants growing by the side of roads or fields with

complex-shaped superellipsoid particles of SiO2 is presented. The particles
under study are 50 nm in radius and of variable concavity. Orientation is
characterized by the degree of rotational symmetry in the two-particle systems,
and the radiative conductance is calculated using the discrete system Green's
function approach to account for all electromagnetic interactions. Results
reveal that the total conductance in some orientations can be up to twice that
of other orientations when particles are at center-of-mass separation distances
of 110 nm. Orientation effects are not significantly correlated with system
rotational symmetries but are strongly correlated with the minimum vacuum gap
distance between particles. As such, orientation effects on near-field
radiative heat transfer are a consequence of particle topology, with more
extreme topologies leading to a continuation of orientation effects at larger
particle center-of-mass separation distances. The concave superellipsoid
particles display significant orientation effects up to a center-of-mass
separation distance approximately equal to 3.9 times the particle radius, while
the convex superellipsoid particles display significant orientation effects up
to a center-of-mass separation distance approximately equal to 3.2 times the
particle radius. In contrast to previous anisotropic, spheroidal dipole
studies, these results of complex-shaped superellipsoid particles suggest that
orientation effects become negligible when heat transfer is a volumetric
process for all orientations. This work is essential for understanding
radiative transport between particles that have non-regular geometries or that
may have geometrical defects or abnormalities.

through our Solar System permitted only incomplete characterization. We
investigate avenues for identifying craters that may have been produced by ISOs
impacting terrestrial Solar System bodies, with particular attention towards
the Moon. A distinctive feature of ISOs is their relatively high encounter
velocity compared to asteroids and comets. Local stellar kinematics indicate
that terrestrial Solar System bodies should have experienced of order unity ISO
impacts exceeding 100 km/s. By running hydrodynamical simulations for
projectiles of different masses and impact velocities, up to 100 km/s, we show
how late-stage equivalence dictates that transient crater dimensions are alone
insufficient for inferring the projectile's velocity. On the other hand, the
melt volume within craters of a fixed diameter may be a potential route for
identifying ISO craters, as faster impacts produce more melt. This method
requires that the melt volume scales with the energy of the projectile, while
crater diameter scales with the point-source limit (sub-energy). Given that
there are probably only a few ISO craters in the Solar System at best, and that
transient crater dimensions are not a distinguishing feature for impact
velocities at least up to 100 km/s, identification of an ISO crater proves a
challenging task. Melt volume and high-pressure petrology may be diagnostic

to occur at the sharp inner curve of the anastomosis. Large Eddy Simulations
(LES) of a patient-specific AVF with and without the presence of a stent
captured oscillatory flow behaviour emanating from the interface of the two

subdued in the stented case. The stent-absent case generally had higher
Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) in the anastomosis which led to larger

slight increase in turbulence downstream of the malapposed stent edge was
noted. This detailed study reveals a significant decrease in turbulence within
the AVF in the presence of the stent, thereby, providing a level of
understanding underpinning the success of the treatment strategy from a fluid

contrived setting and needs to be relaxed. This has misled us to focus on model
classes that are not expressive enough to begin with. Instead, inspired by
human vision and the fact that we rely more on robust features such as shape,
vertices, and foreground objects than non-robust features such as texture,
efforts should be steered towards looking for significantly different classes
of models. Maybe instead of narrowing down on imperceptible adversarial
perturbations, we should attack a more general problem which is finding
architectures that are simultaneously robust to perceptible perturbations,
geometric transformations (e.g. rotation, scaling), image distortions
(lighting, blur), and more (e.g. occlusion, shadow). Only then we may be able
to solve the problem of adversarial vulnerability.

high-fidelity galaxy lightcones constructed from the large Uchuu 2.1 trillion

matching to populate the Uchuu-box halo catalogues with SDSS galaxy
luminosities. These cubic box galaxy catalogues generated at several redshifts
are combined to create the set of lightcones with redshift-evolving galaxy
properties. The Uchuu-SDSS galaxy lightcones are built to reproduce the
footprint and statistical properties of the SDSS main galaxy survey, along with
stellar masses and star formation rates. This facilitates direct comparison of
the observed SDSS and simulated Uchuu-SDSS data. Our lightcones reproduce a
large number of observational results, such as the distribution of galaxy
properties, the galaxy clustering, the stellar mass functions, and the halo
occupation distributions. Using the simulated and real data we select samples
of bright red galaxies at $z_\mathrm{eff}=0.15$ to explore Redshift Space
Distortions and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) utilizing a full-shape
analytical model of the two-point correlation function. We create a set of 5100
galaxy lightcones using GLAM N-body simulations to compute covariance errors.
We report a $\sim 30\%$ precision increase on $f\sigma_8$, due to our better
estimate of the covariance matrix. From our BAO-inferred $\alpha_{\parallel}$

27.9^{+3.1}_{-2.7}$, $D_\mathrm{M}(z=0.15) / r_d = 5.1^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$. Overall,
we conclude that the Planck LCDM cosmology nicely explains the observed

fluid from large-scale observations on the flow field. A relaxation-based
approach is proposed for accomplishing this, which leverages a nonlinear
property of the equations of motions to asymptotically enslave small scales to
large scales. In particular, an algorithm is introduced that systematically
produces approximations of the flow field on the unobserved scales in order to
generate an approximation to the unknown force; the process is then repeated to
generate an improved approximation of the unobserved scales, and so on. A
mathematical proof of convergence of this algorithm is established in the
context of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with periodic boundary
conditions under the assumption that the force belongs to the observational
subspace of phase space; at each stage in the algorithm, it is shown that the
model error, represented as the difference between the approximating and true
force, asymptotically decrements to zero in a geometric fashion provided that
sufficiently many scales are observed and certain parameters of the algorithm
are appropriately tuned; the issue of the sharpness of the assumptions, among
other practical considerations such as the transient periods between updates,
are also discussed.

interference, such as baseline wander. High-quality and high-fidelity
reconstruction of the ECG signals is of great significance to diagnosing
cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel ECG baseline
wander and noise removal technology. Methods: We extended the diffusion model
in a conditional manner that was specific to the ECG signals, namely the Deep
Score-Based Diffusion model for Electrocardiogram baseline wander and noise
removal (DeScoD-ECG). Moreover, we deployed a multi-shots averaging strategy
that improved signal reconstructions. We conducted the experiments on the QT
Database and the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database to verify the feasibility
of the proposed method. Baseline methods are adopted for comparison, including
traditional digital filter-based and deep learning-based methods. Results: The
quantities evaluation results show that the proposed method obtained
outstanding performance on four distance-based similarity metrics with at least
20\% overall improvement compared with the best baseline method. Conclusion:
This paper demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of the DeScoD-ECG for
ECG baseline wander and noise removal, which has better approximations of the
true data distribution and higher stability under extreme noise corruptions.
Significance: This study is one of the first to extend the conditional
diffusion-based generative model for ECG noise removal, and the DeScoD-ECG has
the potential to be widely used in biomedical applications.

However the plane wave expansion of standing waves by means of complex phasors

between two ways omitted variables can affect baseline estimates: by driving
them to zero or by reversing their sign. We show that, depending on how the
impact of omitted variables is measured, it can be substantially easier for
omitted variables to flip coefficient signs than to drive them to zero.
Consequently, results which are considered robust to being ""explained away"" by
omitted variables are not necessarily robust to sign changes. We show that this
behavior occurs with ""Oster's delta"" (Oster 2019), a commonly reported measure
of regression coefficient robustness to the presence of omitted variables.
Specifically, we show that any time this measure is large--suggesting that
omitted variables may be unimportant--a much smaller value reverses the sign of
the parameter of interest. Relatedly, we show that selection bias adjusted
estimands can be extremely sensitive to the choice of the sensitivity
parameter. Specifically, researchers commonly compute a bias adjustment under
the assumption that Oster's delta equals one. Under the alternative assumption
that delta is very close to one, but not exactly equal to one, we show that the
bias can instead be arbitrarily large. To address these concerns, we propose a
modified measure of robustness that accounts for such sign changes, and discuss
best practices for assessing sensitivity to omitted variables. We demonstrate
this sign flipping behavior in an empirical application to social capital and
the rise of the Nazi party, where we show how it can overturn conclusions about
robustness, and how our proposed modifications can be used to regain
robustness. We analyze three additional empirical applications as well. We
implement our proposed methods in the companion Stata module regsensitivity for

regimes of high fundamental importance to modern quantum technologies. Strong
interaction of a qubit with a single photon of an electromagnetic field mode is
described by the cavity/circuit electrodynamics (QED) regime which is one of
the most advanced platforms for quantum computing. The opposite regime of the
waveguide QED, where qubits interact with a continuum of modes in an infinite
one-dimensional space, is also at the focus of recent research revealing novel
quantum phenomena. Despite the demonstration of several key features of
waveguide QED, the transition from an experimentally realizable finite-size
system to the theoretically assumed infinite device size is neither rigorously
justified nor fully understood. In this paper, we formulate a unifying theory
which under a minimal set of standard approximations accounts for physical
boundaries of a system in all parameter domains. Considering two qubits in a
rectangular waveguide which naturally exhibits a low frequency cutoff we are
able to account for infinite number of modes and obtain an accurate description
of the waveguide transmission, a life-time of a qubit-photon bound state and
the exchange interaction between two qubit-photon bounds states. For
verification, we compare our theory to experimental data obtained for two
superconducting qubits in a rectangular waveguide demonstrating how the
infinite size limit of waveguide QED emerges in a finite-size system. Our
theory can be straightforwardly extended to other waveguides such as the
photonic crystal and coupled cavity arrays.

numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection exhausts and have been suggested
to be caused by the magnetization of the electron outflow jet by the compressed
reconnected magnetic fields [Shuster et al., ${\it Geophys.~Res.~Lett.}, {\bf
41}$, 5389 (2014)]. We present a theory of the dependence of the major and
minor radii of the ring distributions solely in terms of upstream (lobe) plasma
conditions, thereby allowing a prediction of the associated temperature and
temperature anisotropy of the rings in terms of upstream parameters. We test
the validity of the prediction using 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC)
simulations with varying upstream plasma density and temperature, finding
excellent agreement between the predicted and simulated values. We confirm the
Shuster et al. suggestion for the cause of the ring distributions, and also
find that the ring distributions are located in a region marked by a plateau,
or shoulder, in the reconnected magnetic field profile. The predictions of the
temperature are consistent with observed electron temperatures in
dipolarization fronts, and may provide an explanation for the generation of
plasma with temperatures in the 10s of MK in super-hot solar flares. A possible
extension of the model to dayside reconnection is discussed. Since ring
distributions are known to excite whistler waves, the present results should be
useful for quantifying the generation of whistler waves in reconnection
exhausts.

not only non-rigid human generation with diverse appearance but also full
control over poses and viewpoints, while only requiring 2D images for training.
Specifically, it extends the recent 3D GANs to clothed human generation by
utilizing a coarse human body model as a proxy to warp the observation space
into a standard avatar under a canonical space. To model non-rigid dynamics, it
introduces a deformation network to learn pose-dependent deformations in the
canonical space. To improve geometry quality of the generated human avatars, it
leverages signed distance field as geometric representation, which allows more
direct regularization from the body model on the geometry learning. Benefiting
from these designs, our method can generate animatable human avatars with
high-quality appearance and geometry modeling, significantly outperforming
previous 3D GANs. Furthermore, it is competent for many applications, e.g.,
single-view reconstruction, reanimation, and text-guided synthesis. Code and
pre-trained model will be available.

deep neural network (DNN) models for classification tasks. In the existing
works on this subject, researchers have intensively focused on watermarking
robustness, while fidelity, which is concerned with the original functionality,
has received less attention. In this paper, we show that the existing shared
notion of the sole measurement of learning accuracy is insufficient to
characterize backdoor fidelity. Meanwhile, we show that the analogous concept
of embedding distortion in multimedia watermarking, interpreted as the total
weight loss (TWL) in DNN backdoor watermarking, is also unsuitable to measure
the fidelity. To solve this problem, we propose the concept of deep fidelity,
which states that the backdoor watermarked DNN model should preserve both the
feature representation and decision boundary of the unwatermarked host model.
Accordingly, to realize deep fidelity, we propose two loss functions termed as
penultimate feature loss (PFL) and softmax probability-distribution loss (SPL)
to preserve feature representation, while the decision boundary is preserved by
the proposed fix last layer (FixLL) treatment, inspired by the recent discovery
that deep learning with a fixed classifier causes no loss of learning accuracy.
With the above designs, both embedding from scratch and fine-tuning strategies
are implemented to evaluate deep fidelity of backdoor embedding, whose
advantages over the existing methods are verified via experiments using
ResNet18 for MNIST and CIFAR-10 classifications, and wide residual network
(i.e., WRN28_10) for CIFAR-100 task.

sense that the resulting Krylov space is identical to that of the Lanczos

finite sample noise. This is possible because, unlike previous quantum Krylov
methods, our algorithm does not require simulating real or imaginary time

energy estimate in the presence of noise. For our method to be successful

onset) of symptoms consistent with Influenza and COVID-19, using data from the
Flutracking survey. The method mitigates some of the known self-selection and
symptom-reporting biases present in existing approaches to this type of
participatory longitudinal survey data. The key novel steps in the analysis
are:
  1) Identifying new onset of symptoms for three different Symptom Groupings:
COVID-like illness (CLI1+, CLI2+), and Influenza-like illness (ILI), for
responses reported in the Flutracking survey.
  2) Adjusting for symptom reporting bias by restricting the analysis to a
sub-set of responses from those participants who have consistently responded
for a number of weeks prior to the analysis week.
  3) Weighting responses by age to adjust for self-selection bias in order to
account for the under- and over-representation of different age groups amongst
the survey participants. This uses the survey package in R.
  4) Constructing 95% point-wise confidence bands for incidence estimates using
weighted logistic regression from the survey package in R.
  In addition to describing these steps, the article demonstrates an
application of this method to Flutracking data for the 12 months from 27th

$M_{1450} \sim -22.0$ AB mag at $z\sim5$, about one magnitude deeper than
previous UV LFs. We select quasars at $z\sim5$ with a deep learning technique
from deep data taken by the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program
(HSC-SSP), covering a 15.5 deg$^2$ area. Beyond the traditional color selection
method, we improved the quasar selection by training an artificial neural
network for distinguishing $z\sim5$ quasars from non-quasar sources based on
their colors and adopting the Bayesian information criterion that can further
remove high-redshift galaxies from the quasar sample. When applied to a small
sample of spectroscopically identified quasars and galaxies, our method is
successful in selecting quasars at $\sim83 \%$ efficiency ($5/6$) while
minimizing the contamination rate of high-redshift galaxies ($1/8$) by up to
three times compared to the selection using color selection alone ($3/8$). The
number of our final quasar candidates with $M_{1450} < -22.0$ mag is 35. Our
quasar UV LF down to $M_{1450} = -22$ mag or even fainter ($M_{1450} = -21$

because they are decoupled from human detection and allow researchers to focus

information from the very beginning, which makes themselves unable to
accurately predict the global rotation in the original camera coordinate
system. To address this problem, we propose to Carry Location Information in
Full Frames (CLIFF) into this task. Specifically, we feed more holistic
features to CLIFF by concatenating the cropped-image feature with its bounding
box information. We calculate the 2D reprojection loss with a broader view of
the full frame, taking a projection process similar to that of the person
projected in the image. Fed and supervised by global-location-aware
information, CLIFF directly predicts the global rotation along with more
accurate articulated poses. Besides, we propose a pseudo-ground-truth annotator
based on CLIFF, which provides high-quality 3D annotations for in-the-wild 2D
datasets and offers crucial full supervision for regression-based methods.

property of a COB is shown to play a key role in the construction of SIC POVMs
and also for the bound of the mean-square error of the state tomography. In
particular, a necessary and sufficient condition to construct a SIC POVM for
any d is constructively given by the power of traces of a COB. We give three
simple constructions of COBs from which one can systematically obtain GSIC
POVMs.

but suffer from quadratic computational and memory complexities with respect to
the length of the input sequence. Leveraging techniques include sparse and
linear attention and hashing tricks; efficient transformers have been proposed
to reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers but significantly degrade
the accuracy. In response, we first interpret the linear attention and residual
connections in computing the attention map as gradient descent steps. We then
introduce momentum into these components and propose the \emph{momentum
transformer}, which utilizes momentum to improve the accuracy of linear
transformers while maintaining linear memory and computational complexities.
Furthermore, we develop an adaptive strategy to compute the momentum value for
our model based on the optimal momentum for quadratic optimization. This
adaptive momentum eliminates the need to search for the optimal momentum value
and further enhances the performance of the momentum transformer. A range of
experiments on both autoregressive and non-autoregressive tasks, including
image generation and machine translation, demonstrate that the momentum
transformer outperforms popular linear transformers in training efficiency and
accuracy.

eliminates the quantifier $\exists^\infty$. It follows that very slim fields in

zero-dimensional interpretable sets can have smaller cardinality. As an

observations on spatially extended target sources are often subject to
significant missing fluxes. This hampers accurate quantitative analyses.
Missing flux can be recovered by fusing high-resolution images with
observations that preserve extended structures. However, the commonly adopted
image fusion approaches do not maintain the simplicity of the beam response
function and do not try to elaborate the details of the yielded beam response
functions. These make the comparison of the observations at multiple
wavelengths not straightforward. We present a new algorithm, J-comb, which
combines the high and low-resolution images linearly. By applying a taper
function to the low-pass filtered image and combining it with a high-pass
filtered image using proper weights, the beam response functions of our
combined images are guaranteed to have near-Gaussian shapes. This makes it easy
to convolve the observations at multiple wavelengths to share the same beam
response functions. Moreover, we introduce a strategy to tackle the specific
problem that the imaging at 850 um from the present-date ground-based
bolometric instrument and that taken with the Planck satellite do not overlap
in the Fourier domain. We benchmarked our method against two other widely-used
image combination algorithms, CASA-feather and MIRIAD-immerge, with mock
observations of star-forming molecular clouds. We demonstrate that the
performance of the J-comb algorithm is superior to those of the other two
algorithms. We applied the J-comb algorithm to real observational data of the
Orion A star-forming region. We successfully produced dust temperature and
column density maps with ~10"" angular resolution, unveiling much greater

g-factor perpendicular to the trigonal axis is negligibly small (< 0.112),
whereas the g-factor along the trigonal axis is very large (62.7). We clarified
in this work that the large g- factor anisotropy gives rise to the gigantic
spin conversion anisotropy in Bi from experimental and theoretical approaches.
Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance was applied to estimate the spin conversion
efficiency in rhombohedral (110) Bi to be 17%, which is unlike the negligibly
small efficiency in Bi(111). Harmonic Hall measurements supports the large spin
conversion efficiency in Bi(110). This is the first observation of gigantic

Skyrme Hartree--Fock--Bogoliubov calculations. The $(p,p)$ reactions were
calculated using the relativistic impulse approximation (RIA) assuming the
theoretical densities of target nuclei. The RIA calculations using the target
densities obtained by the RHB calculation, along with the density-dependent
point-coupling interactions reasonably reproduced the $(p,p)$ cross sections in
the studied mass number region. The nuclear structure and $(p,p)$ reactions
were analyzed in detail; especially, the effects of deformation on the isotopic
systematics of the surface densities and $(p,p)$ cross sections were clarified.
The deformation effects were found to be essential to describe the isotopic
systematics of the experimental $(p,p)$ cross sections. Overall, isotopic and
isotonic analyses are useful for extracting the nuclear structure information
such as nuclear deformations and single-particle features from proton
scattering, enabling sensitive probing of surface densities.

this paper, we present a comprehensive real-time machine learning-based

show that several strategies for improving computational efficiency (e.g.,
batch-wise processing, frame skipping, model input size) can be combined to run
the proposed detection model on edge hardware with low resource consumption and
low information loss.

Therefore, different scaling and normalization techniques are used to
preprocess the data for metabolomics data analysis. Although several scaling
methods are available in the literature, however, choice of scaling,
transformation and/or normalization technique influence the further statistical
analysis. It is challenging to choose the appropriate scaling technique for
downstream analysis to get accurate results or to make a proper decision.
Moreover, the existing scaling techniques are sensitive to outliers or extreme
values. To fill the gap, our objective is to introduce a robust scaling
approach that is not influenced by outliers as well as provides more accurate
results for downstream analysis. Here, we introduced a new weighted scaling
approach that is robust against outliers however, where no additional outlier
detection/treatment step is needed in data preprocessing and also compared it
with the conventional scaling and normalization techniques through artificial

method in comparison to the other existing conventional scaling techniques
using metabolomics data analysis in both the absence and presence of different
percentages of outliers. Results show that in most cases, the proposed scaling

the key discriminative regions. While such regions can be automatically
identified from a large-scale labeled dataset, a similar method might become
less effective when only a few annotations are available. In low data regimes,
a network often struggles to choose the correct regions for recognition and
tends to overfit spurious correlated patterns from the training data. To tackle
this issue, this paper proposes the self-boosting attention mechanism, a novel
method for regularizing the network to focus on the key regions shared across
samples and classes. Specifically, the proposed method first generates an
attention map for each training image, highlighting the discriminative part for
identifying the ground-truth object category. Then the generated attention maps
are used as pseudo-annotations. The network is enforced to fit them as an
auxiliary task. We call this approach the self-boosting attention mechanism
(SAM). We also develop a variant by using SAM to create multiple attention maps
to pool convolutional maps in a style of bilinear pooling, dubbed SAM-Bilinear.
Through extensive experimental studies, we show that both methods can
significantly improve fine-grained visual recognition performance on low data
regimes and can be incorporated into existing network architectures. The source

happens for micro-black holes. We also explored GEUP effects on the weak and
strong deflection angles as an alternative analysis. For both realms, a
time-like particle gives a higher value for the weak deflection angle. Similar
to the shadow, the deviation is seen when the values of $L_*$ and $M$ are
close. The strong deflection angle gives more sensitivity to GEUP deviation at
smaller masses in the astrophysical scenario. However, the weak deflection
angle is a better probe in the micro world.

robustness of CNNs against rotations. To tackle this issue, we propose a
rotation meanout (RM) network to extract rotation-invariant features from
dermoscopy images. In RM, each set of rotated feature maps corresponds to a set
of outputs of the weight-sharing convolutions and they are fused using meanout
strategy to obtain the final feature maps. Through theoretical derivation, the
proposed RM network is rotation-equivariant and can extract rotation-invariant
features when followed by the global average pooling (GAP) operation. The
extracted rotation-invariant features can better represent the original data in
classification and retrieval tasks for dermoscopy images. The RM is a general
operation, which does not change the network structure or increase any
parameter, and can be flexibly embedded in any part of CNNs. Extensive
experiments are conducted on a dermoscopy image dataset. The results show our
method outperforms other anti-rotation methods and achieves great improvements
in dermoscopy image classification and retrieval tasks, indicating the
potential of rotation invariance in the field of dermoscopy images.

research problem for various applications, including accelerating the spread of

influential source spreaders who can spread their own messages to many other
nodes. In contrast, the identification of influential brokers who can spread
other nodes' messages to many nodes has not been fully explored. Theoretical
and empirical studies suggest that involvement of both influential source
spreaders and brokers is a key to facilitating large-scale information
diffusion cascades. Therefore, this paper explores ways to identify influential
brokers from a given social network. By using three social media datasets, we
investigate the characteristics of influential brokers by comparing them with
influential source spreaders and central nodes obtained from centrality
measures. Our results show that (i) most of the influential source spreaders
are not influential brokers (and vice versa) and (ii) the overlap between
central nodes and influential brokers is small (less than 15%) in Twitter
datasets. We also tackle the problem of identifying influential brokers from
centrality measures and node embeddings, and we examine the effectiveness of
social network features in the broker identification task. Our results show
that (iii) although a single centrality measure cannot characterize influential
brokers well, prediction models using node embedding features achieve F$_1$
scores of 0.35--0.68, suggesting the effectiveness of social network features
for identifying influential brokers.

  However, multi-spectral vehicle Re-ID suffers cross-modality discrepancy

  Meanwhile, diverse environmental interference leads to heavy sample
distributional discrepancy in each modality.
  In this work, we propose a novel cross-directional consistency network to
simultaneously overcome the discrepancies from both modality and sample
aspects.
  In particular, we design a new cross-directional center loss to pull the
modality centers of each identity close to mitigate cross-modality discrepancy,
while the sample centers of each identity close to alleviate the sample
discrepancy. Such strategy can generate discriminative multi-spectral feature
representations for vehicle Re-ID.

adjust individual feature distribution to handle distributional discrepancy of
intra-modality features for robust learning.

effects on the measured system. In a bipartite correlated quantum system that
decomposed of main and ancillary systems, we showed that the extractable work
by the non-selective weak measurement on ancilla is always equal to the
situation captured by the strong measurement. As such, the selective weak
measurement reveals more work than the daemonic ergotropy. The ergotropy of the
total system is also greater than or equal to the daemonic ergotropy. We showed
that for Bell diagonal states, at the cost of losing quantum correlation, the
total extractable and thus non-local extractable works can be increased by
means of measurement. We also show that for these cases, there is no direct

cognitive processes while writing with next-phrase suggestion systems. To do
so, we recruited 14 amateur writers to write two reviews each, one without
suggestions and one with suggestions. Additionally, we also positively and
negatively biased the suggestion system to get a diverse range of instances
where writers' opinions and the bias in the language model align or misalign to
varying degrees. We found that writers interact with next-phrase suggestions in
various complex ways: Writers abstracted and extracted multiple parts of the
suggestions and incorporated them within their writing, even when they
disagreed with the suggestion as a whole; along with evaluating the suggestions
on various criteria. The suggestion system also had various effects on the
writing process, such as altering the writer's usual writing plans, leading to
higher levels of distraction etc. Based on our qualitative analysis using the
cognitive process model of writing by Hayes as a lens, we propose a theoretical

virion, and as such can become extinct, i.e. stochastically fail to take hold
or spread significantly. There are many ways that a fully competent infectious
virion, having successfully entered a cell, can fail to cause a productive
infection, i.e. one that yields infectious virus progeny. Though many discrete,
stochastic mathematical models (DSMs) have been developed and used to estimate
a virus infection's extinction probability, these typically neglect infection
failure post viral entry. The DSM presented herein introduces parameter
$\gamma\in(0,1]$ which corresponds to the probability that a virion's entry
into a cell will result in a productive cell infection. We derive an expression
for the likelihood of infection extinction in this new DSM, and find that
prophylactic therapy with an antiviral acting to reduce $\gamma$ is best at
increasing an infection's extinction probability, compared to antivirals acting
on the rates of virus production or virus entry into cells. Using the DSM, we
investigate the difference in the fraction of cells consumed by so-called
extinct versus established virus infections, and find that this distinction
becomes biologically meaningless as the probability of extinction approaches
100%. We show that infections wherein virus is release by an infected cell as a
single burst, rather than at a constant rate over the cell's infectious
lifespan, has the same probability of infection extinction, despite previous
claims to this effect [Pearson 2011, doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001058].
Instead, extending previous work by others [Yan 2016,

control operations, such as editing the text w.r.t. an attribute, manipulating
keywords and structure, and generating new text of desired properties. Prior
work typically learns/finetunes a language model (LM) to perform individual or
specific subsets of operations. Recent research has studied combining
operations in a plug-and-play manner, often with costly search or optimization
in the complex sequence space. This paper proposes a new efficient approach for
composable text operations in the compact latent space of text. The
low-dimensionality and differentiability of the text latent vector allow us to
develop an efficient sampler based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
given arbitrary plug-in operators (e.g., attribute classifiers). By connecting
pretrained LMs (e.g., GPT2) to the latent space through efficient adaption, we
then decode the sampled vectors into desired text sequences. The flexible
approach permits diverse control operators (sentiment, tense, formality,
keywords, etc.) acquired using any relevant data from different domains.
Experiments show that composing those operators within our approach manages to
generate or edit high-quality text, substantially improving over previous
methods in terms of generation quality and efficiency.

breaking time-reversal symmetry (TRS) of the vortex without an external field.
Here, we used scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy

downlink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with

consider rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) to enhance spectral efficiency
by offering opportunities to boost achievable degrees of freedom. Optimizing
RSMA precoders, however, is highly challenging due to the minimum rate
constraint when determining the rate of the common stream. The quantization
errors coupled with the precoders further make the problem more complicated and
difficult to solve. In this paper, we develop a novel RSMA precoding algorithm
incorporating quantization errors for maximizing the sum spectral efficiency.
To this end, we first obtain an approximate spectral efficiency in a smooth
function. Subsequently, we derive the first-order optimality condition in the
form of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem (NEP). We propose a computationally
efficient algorithm to find the principal eigenvector of the NEP as a
sub-optimal solution. Simulation results validate the superior spectral
efficiency of the proposed method. The key benefit of using RSMA over spatial
division multiple access (SDMA) comes from the ability of the common stream to
balance between the channel gain and quantization error in multiuser MIMO
systems with different quantization resolutions.

resonate to tidal forcing? Substantially at a level of impacting the space
weather or even of being dynamo-relevant? In particular, low-frequency Rossby
waves, which have been detected in the solar near-surface layers, are
predestined at responding to sunspot cycle-scale perturbations. In this paper,
we seek to address these questions as we formulate a forced wave model for the
tachocline layer, which is widely considered as the birthplace of several
magnetohydrodynamic planetary waves, i.e., Rossby, inertia-gravity
(Poincar\'{e}), Kelvin, Alfv\'{e}n and gravity waves. The tachocline is modeled
as a shallow plasma atmosphere with an effective free surface on top that we
describe within the Cartesian $\beta$-plane approximation. As a novelty to
former studies, we equip the governing equations with a conservative tidal
potential and a linear friction law to account for dissipation. We combine the
linearized governing equations to one decoupled wave equation, which
facilitates an easily approachable analysis. Analytical results are presented
and discussed within several interesting free, damped and forced wave limits
for both mid-latitude and equatorially trapped waves. For the idealized case of
a single tide generating body following a circular orbit, we derive an explicit
analytic solution that we apply to our Sun for estimating leading-order
responses to Jupiter. Our analysis reveals that Rossby waves resonating to
low-frequency perturbations can potentially reach considerable velocity
amplitudes in the order of $10^1 - 10^2\, {\rm cm}\, {\rm s}^{-1}$, which,
however, strongly rely on the yet unknown total dissipation.

fair representation learning methods since they would yield random or
degenerate representations w.r.t. labels when the sensitive attributes
correlate with labels. Existing works proposed to inject the label information
into the learning procedure to overcome such issues. However, the assumption
that the observed labels are clean is not always met. In fact, label bias is
acknowledged as the primary source inducing discrimination. In other words, the
fair pre-processing methods ignore the discrimination encoded in the labels
either during the learning procedure or the evaluation stage. This
contradiction puts a question mark on the fairness of the learned
representations. To circumvent this issue, we explore the following question:
\emph{Can we learn fair representations predictable to latent ideal fair labels

\textbf{D}e-\textbf{B}iased \textbf{R}epresentation Learning for
\textbf{F}airness (DBRF) framework which disentangles the sensitive information
from non-sensitive attributes whilst keeping the learned representations
predictable to ideal fair labels rather than observed biased ones. We formulate
the de-biased learning framework through information-theoretic concepts such as
mutual information and information bottleneck. The core concept is that DBRF
advocates not to use unreliable labels for supervision when sensitive
information benefits the prediction of unreliable labels. Experiment results
over both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that DBRF effectively
learns de-biased representations towards ideal labels.

usually forbidden due to the momentum and energy conservation laws: the phase
velocity of the collective modes of the condensate called bogolons is
sufficiently lower than the speed of light. Thus, only the light scattering
processes persist. However, the situation might be different in the case of
composite bosons or the bosons with an internal structure. Here, we develop a
microscopic theory of electromagnetic power absorption by a Bose-Einstein

of a weakly-interacting Bose gas. Thus, we address the transitions between a
collective coherent state of bosons and the discrete energy levels
corresponding to excited internal degrees of freedom of non-condensed
individual bosons. It is shown, that such transitions are mediated by one and
two-bogolon excitations above the condensate, which demonstrate different

urban and rescue planning. Moreover, they can be used for building damage
assessment after natural disasters. Currently, most of the existing models for
building detection use only one image (pre-disaster image) to detect buildings.
This is based on the idea that post-disaster images reduce the model's
performance because of presence of destroyed buildings. In this paper, we
propose a siamese model, called SiamixFormer, which uses pre- and post-disaster
images as input. Our model has two encoders and has a hierarchical transformer
architecture. The output of each stage in both encoders is given to a temporal
transformer for feature fusion in a way that query is generated from
pre-disaster images and (key, value) is generated from post-disaster images. To
this end, temporal features are also considered in feature fusion. Another
advantage of using temporal transformers in feature fusion is that they can
better maintain large receptive fields generated by transformer encoders
compared with CNNs. Finally, the output of the temporal transformer is given to
a simple MLP decoder at each stage. The SiamixFormer model is evaluated on xBD,
and WHU datasets, for building detection and on LEVIR-CD and CDD datasets for
change detection and could outperform the state-of-the-art.

gathered by interacting in an exploratory fashion with real road-network-users,
such a lack of transferability limits experimentation and applicability. Recent
approaches enable learning policies that generalize for unseen road-network

However, the literature remains divided between the learning of cyclic (the
evolution of connectivity at an intersection must respect a cycle) and acyclic
(less constrained) policies, and these transferable methods 1) are only
compatible with cyclic constraints and 2) do not enable coordination. We
introduce a new model-based method, MuJAM, which, on top of enabling explicit
coordination at scale for the first time, pushes generalization further by
allowing a generalization to the controllers' constraints. In a zero-shot
transfer setting involving both road networks and traffic settings never
experienced during training, and in a larger transfer experiment involving the
control of 3,971 traffic signal controllers in Manhattan, we show that MuJAM,
using both cyclic and acyclic constraints, outperforms domain-specific
baselines as well as another transferable approach.

free to move along the beam has been studied recently by multiple research
groups. Under harmonic base excitation, the system has the capacity to
passively adapt itself (by slowly changing the slider position) to yield either
high or low vibrations. The central contributions of this work are the
refinement of the recently developed system model with regard to the finite
stiffness of the beam's clamping, followed by a thorough validation of this
model against experimental results. With the intent to achieve repeatable and
robust self-adaption, a new prototype of the system was designed, featuring, in
particular, a continuously adjustable gap size and a concave inner contact
geometry. The initial beam model is updated based on the results of an
Experimental Nonlinear Modal Analysis of the system (without slider). By
varying the excitation level and frequency in a wide range, all known types of
behavior were reproduced in the experiment. The simulation results of the
updated model with slider are in excellent agreement with the measurements,
both qualitatively (type of behavior) and quantitatively. Minor deviations are
attributed to the system's sensitivity to inevitable uncertainties, in
particular with regard to the friction coefficient and the linear natural
frequency. It is thus concluded that the proposed model is well-suited for
further analysis of its intriguing dynamics and for model-based optimization
for technical applications such as energy harvesting.

for 6.5% of all CO2 emissions on the planet. This fact challenges the current
technologies to achieve carbon-lean steel production and to align with the
requirement of a drastic reduction of 80% in all CO2 emissions by around 2050.
Thus, alternative reduction technologies have to be implemented for extracting
iron from its ores. The H-based direct reduction has been explored as a
sustainable route to mitigate CO2 emissions, where the reduction kinetics of
the intermediate oxide product FexO wustite into Fe is the rate-limiting step
of the process. The total reaction has an endothermic net energy balance.
Reduction based on a H plasma may offer an attractive alternative. Here, we
present a study about the reduction of hematite using H plasma. The evolution
of both, chemical composition and phase transformations was investigated in
several intermediate states. We found that hematite reduction kinetics depends
on the balance between the initial input mass and the arc power. For an
optimized input mass-arc power ratio, complete reduction was obtained within 15
min of exposure to the H plasma. The wustite reduction is also the
rate-limiting step towards complete reduction. Nonetheless, the reduction
reaction is exothermic, and its rates are comparable with those found in
H-based direct reduction. Chemical and microstructure analysis revealed that
the gangue elements partition to the remaining oxide regions, probed by energy
dispersive spectroscopy and atom probe tomography. Si-enrichment was observed
in the interdendritic fayalite domains, at the wustite/Fe hetero-interfaces and
in the primarily solidified oxide particles inside the Fe. With proceeding
reduction, however, such elements are gradually removed from the samples so
that the final iron product is nearly free of gangue-related impurities.

RASIPAM, a RAcket-Sports Interactive PAttern Mining system, which allows
experts to incorporate their knowledge into data mining algorithms to discover
meaningful tactics interactively. RASIPAM consists of a constraint-based

Experts provide suggestions for finding tactics in intuitive written language,
and these suggestions are translated into constraints to run the algorithm.
RASIPAM further introduces a tailored visual interface that allows experts to
compare the new tactics with the original ones and decide whether to apply a
given adjustment. This interactive workflow iteratively progresses until
experts are satisfied with all tactics. We conduct a quantitative experiment to
show that our algorithm supports real-time interaction. Two case studies in

others. Several analytical, numerical and semi-analytical approaches have been
devised to calculate the solutions of this equation. Semi-analytical methods
are commonly employed since they do not require discretization of the space
variable. The article deals with the introduction of a novel semi-analytical
technique called the optimized decomposition method (ODM) (see
\cite{odibat2020optimized}) to compute solutions of this relevant
integro-partial differential equation. The series solution computed using ODM
is shown to converge to the exact solution. The theoretical results are
validated using numerical examples for scientifically relevant aggregation
kernels for which the exact solutions are available. Additionally, the ODM
approximated results are compared with the solutions obtained using the Adomian
decomposition method (ADM) in \cite{singh2015adomian}. The novel method is
shown to be superior to ADM for the examples considered and thus establishes as
an improved and efficient method for solving the Smoluchowski's equation.

GUI-based test automation, despite much research and several proposed
solutions. A test script needs to be resilient to (minor) changes in the tested
application but, at the same time, fail when detecting potential issues that
require investigation. Test script fragility is a multi-faceted problem, but
one crucial challenge is reliably identifying and locating the correct target
web elements when the website evolves between releases or otherwise fails and
reports an issue. This paper proposes and evaluates a novel approach called
similarity-based web element localization (Similo), which leverages information
from multiple web element locator parameters to identify a target element using
a weighted similarity score. The experimental study compares Similo to a
baseline approach for web element localization. To get an extensive empirical
basis, we target 40 of the most popular websites on the Internet in our
evaluation. Robustness is considered by counting the number of web elements
found in a recent website version compared to how many of these existed in an
older version. Results of the experiment show that Similo outperforms the
baseline representing the current state-of-the-art; it failed to locate the
correct target web element in 72 out of 598 considered cases compared to 146
failed cases for the baseline approach. This study presents evidence that
quantifying the similarity between multiple attributes of web elements when
trying to locate them, as in our proposed Similo approach, is beneficial. With
acceptable efficiency, Similo gives significantly higher effectiveness (i.e.,
robustness) than the baseline web element localization approach.

was efficient to achieve a certain accuracy level in the synthetic EM
responses. Regarding global $p-$refinement, $p=2$ exhibits the best
accuracy/performance trade-off. Selective $p$-refinement might offer a better
compromise between accuracy and computational cost. However, for $p-$refinement
at different entities, the best refinement scheme consists of using $p=3$ at
the volume level with $p=1$ at faces and edges. Thus, $p-$refinement can be
competitive if applied hierarchically. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that the

rotation should stop in the linear approximation. We find correlations between
the lags, stop altitude and galactic mass, stellar velocity dispersion and
overall Sersic index. We do not find any correlation of the lags or stop
altitude with the star formation activity in the galaxies. We conclude that low
mass galaxies (log(M*/Mo) < 10) with low Sersic index and with low stellar
velocity dispersion posses a wider ""zone of influence"" in the extragalactic gas
surrounding them with respect to higher mass galaxies that have a significant
spherical component. We estimated the trend of the vertical rotational gradient
with radius and find it flat for most of the galaxies in our sample. A small
subsample of galaxies with negative radial gradients of lag has an enhanced
fraction of objects with aged low surface brightness structures around them
(e.g. faint shells), which indicates that noticeable accretion events in the
past affected the extraplanar gas kinematics and might have contributed to
negative radial lag gradients. We conclude that an isotropic accretion of gas

particle method preserves the main physical properties of the problem, such as
conservations and positivity of the solution, while achieving spectral accuracy
for smooth solutions in the random space. Furthermore, in the fluid limit the
sG particle solver is designed to possess the asymptotic-preserving property
necessary to obtain a sG particle scheme for the limiting Euler-Poisson system,
thus avoiding the loss of hyperbolicity typical of conventional sG methods

considering the classical Landau damping problem in the presence of both small

which hardens the particle spectra and accordingly the radiative emission.
Given the physical properties of the plasma, as inferred by emission models, we
expect a strong impact of the accelerating particles on the turbulence.
Assuming isotropy and homogeneity, the interaction between non-thermal

non-linear, coupled Fokker-Planck equations, while the radiative emission is

(explicit) and the PDE-based (implicit), and introduces an implicit
bulk-surface filtering method to control the boundary smoothness and preserve
the internal mesh quality simultaneously in the course of bulk (solid) shape
optimization. To that end, volumetric mesh is filtered by the solution of
pseudo-solid governing equations which are stiffened by the mesh-Jacobian and
endowed with the Robin boundary condition which involves the Laplace-Beltrami
operator on the mesh boundaries. Its superior performance from the
non-simultaneous (sequential) treatment of boundary and internal meshes is
demonstrated for the shape optimization of a complex solid structure.
Well-established explicit filters, namely Gaussian and linear, and the
Helmholtz/Sobolev-based (implicit) filter are critically examined in terms of
consistency (rigid-body-movement production), geometric characteristics and the
computational cost. It is shown that the implicit filtering is numerically more
efficient and unconditionally consistent, compared to the explicit one.
Supported by numerical experiments, a regularized Green's function is
introduced as an equivalent explicit form of the Helmholtz/Sobolev filter.
Furthermore, we give special attention to derive mesh-independent filtered
sensitivities for node-based shape optimization with non-uniform meshes. It is
shown that the mesh independent filtering can be achieved by scaling discrete
sensitivities with the inverse of the mesh mass matrix.

spacetime via the method of injecting a test particle. Hence, we need to know
how the black hole's parameters change when a test particle enters the horizon.
This was an unresolved issue for non-asymptotically flat spacetimes since there
are ambiguities on the energies of black holes and particles. We find a novel
approach to solve the problem. We start with the ""physical process version"" of
the first law, which relates the particle's parameters with the change in the
area of the black hole. By comparing this first law with the usual first law of
black hole thermodynamics, we redefine the particle's energy such that the
energy can match the mass parameter of the black hole. Then, we show that the
horizon of the extremal magnetized Kerr-Newman black hole could be destroyed
after a charged test particle falls in, which leads to a possible violation of
the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. We also find that the allowed parameter
range for this process is very small, which indicates that after the self-force
and radiation effects are taken into account, the weak cosmic censorship
conjecture could still be valid. In contrast to the case where the magnetic
field is absent, the particle cannot be released at infinity to destroy the
horizon. And in the case of a weak magnetic field, the releasing point becomes
closer to the horizon as the magnetic field increases. This indicates that the
magnetic field makes the violation of the cosmic censorship more difficult.
Finally, by applying our new method to Kerr-Newman-dS (AdS) black holes, which
are well-known non-asymptotically flat spacetimes, we obtain the expression of
the particle's energy which matches the black hole's mass parameter.

Unfortunately, visual-inertial state estimators suffer from the accumulation of

can be fused into the state estimation pipeline. The most known and widely
available source of global measurements is the Global Positioning System (GPS).
In this paper, we propose a novel approach that fully combines stereo
Visual-Inertial Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM), including visual
loop closures, with the fusion of global sensor modalities in a tightly-coupled

provide a robust criterion to solve the global reference frame initialisation
problem. Furthermore, we propose a loop-closure-like optimisation scheme to
compensate drift accumulated during outages in receiving GPS signals.
Experimental validation on datasets and in a real-world experiment demonstrates

hierarchical Swin-Transformer with shifted windows to extend the DeepLabv3 and
model the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module. A thorough search of
the relevant literature yielded that we are the first to model the seminal
DeepLab model with a pure Transformer-based model. Extensive experiments on
various medical image segmentation tasks verify that our approach performs
superior or on par with most contemporary works on an amalgamation of Vision
Transformer and CNN-based methods, along with a significant reduction of model
complexity. The codes and trained models are publicly available at

the analog precoder and digital precoder. To reduce the computational

then proposed, where each stage has a closed-form solution and can be
efficiently implemented. To reduce the hardware complexity introduced by the
large number of switches, we consider a group-connected VPS architecture and
propose a HPD scheme, where the HPD problem is divided into multiple

function, with (b) an obscured star formation fraction prescription that is
consistent with findings of the ALMA REBELS dusty galaxy survey. It has been
successfully tested on well-known UV LFs up to $z=7$. The weak evolution from

decreasing dust attenuation, making galaxies brighter, that almost exactly
compensates for the increasing shortage of their host halos. The model also
predicts that galaxies at $z > 11$ should contain negligible amounts of dust.
We speculate that dust could have been efficiently ejected during the very

In this work, we
present a statistical study of galaxy quenching in 17 cluster candidates at
0.5<z<1.0 in the COSMOS field. We selected cluster members with a wide range of
stellar mass and environment to study their mass and environment dependence.
Member galaxies are classified into star-forming, quiescent and
recently-quenched galaxies (RQG) using the rest-frame UVJ diagram. We further
separated fast and slow quenching RQGs by model evolutionary tracks on the UVJ
diagram. We defined the quenching efficiency as the ratio of RQGs over
star-forming galaxies and the quenching stage as the ratio of RQGs over
quiescent galaxies to quantify the quenching processes. We found quenching
efficiency is enhanced by both higher stellar mass and denser environment.
Massive or dense environment galaxies quench earlier. Slow quenching is more
dominant for massive galaxies and at lower redshifts, but no clear dependence
on the environment is found. Our results suggest that low-mass galaxies in
dense environments are likely quenched through a short-timescale process such
as ram pressure stripping, while massive galaxies in a sparse environment are
mostly quenched by a longer-timescale process. Using the line strength of
H$\delta$ and [OII], we confirmed that our UVJ method to select RQGs agrees
with high S/N DEIMOS spectra. However, we caution that the visibility time
(duration of a galaxy's stay in the RQG region on the UVJ diagram) may also
depend on mass or environment. The method introduced in this work can be
applied to RQG candidates for future statistical RQG spectroscopic surveys. The
systematic spectroscopic RQG study will disentangle the degeneracy between
visibility time and quenching properties.

renormalization group formalism for full low-energy effective field theories of
non-Fermi liquids that include all gapless modes around the Fermi surface. The
formalism is applied to the non-Fermi liquid that arises at the
antiferromagnetic quantum critical point in two space dimensions. In the space
of coupling functions, an interacting fixed point arises at a point with
momentum-independent couplings and vanishing nesting angle. In theories
deformed with non-zero nesting angles, coupling functions acquire universal
momentum profiles controlled by the bare nesting angles at low energies before
flowing to superconducting states in the low-energy limit. The superconducting
instability is unavoidable because lukewarm electrons that are coherent enough
to be susceptible to pairing end up being subject to a renormalized attractive
interaction with its minimum strength set by the nesting angle. Despite the
inevitable superconducting instability, theories with small bare nesting angles
and bare four-fermion couplings that are repulsive or weakly attractive must
pass through the region with slow RG flow due to the proximity to the non-Fermi
liquid fixed point. The bottleneck region controls the scaling behaviours of
the normal state and the quasi-universal pathway from the non-Fermi liquid to
superconductivity. In the limit that the nesting angle is small, the non-Fermi
liquid scaling dictates the physics over a large window of energy scale above
the superconducting transition temperature.

radionuclide therapies and theranostics, and 3D internal dosimetry for such
procedures has great importance. Voxel S-Values (VSVs) approach is widely used
for this purpose, but VSVs are available for a limited number of voxel
dimensions. The aim of this work is to develop an analytic model for the
calculation of $^{177}$Lu-VSVs in any cubic voxelized geometry of practical
interest. Approach: Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were implemented with the
toolkit GAMOS to evaluate VSVs in voxelized geometries of soft tissue from a
source of $^{177}$Lu homogeneously distributed in the central voxel. Nine
geometric setups, containing 15x15x15 cubic voxels of sides l ranging from 2 mm
to 6 mm, in steps of 0.5 mm, were considered. For each l, the VSVs computed as
a function of the ""normalized radius"", Rn = R/l (with R = distance from the
center of the source voxel), were fitted with a parametric function. The
dependencies of the parameters as a function of l were then fitted with
appropriate functions, in order to implement the model for deducing
$^{177}$Lu-VSVs for any l within the aforementioned range. Main results: The
MC-derived VSVs were satisfactorily compared with literature data for
validation, and the VSVs computed with the analytic model agree with the MC
ones within 2\% for Rn $\leq$ 2 and within 6\% for Rn > 2. Significance: The
proposed model enables the easy and fast calculation, with a simple
spreadsheet, of $^{177}$Lu-VSVs in any cubic voxelized geometry of practical
interest, avoiding the necessity of implementing ad-hoc MC simulations to
estimate VSVs for specific voxel dimensions not available in literature data.

growth, the recent redefinition of the 1kg to defect, and inhomogeneity
detection. A number of technologies (such as LBIC, EBIC and LPS) have been
developed which allow the detection of doping variations via photovoltaic
effects. The idea is to illuminate the sample at several positions and detect
the resulting voltage drop or current at the contacts. We model a general class
of such photovoltaic technologies by ill-posed global and local inverse
problems based on a drift-diffusion system that describes charge transport in a
self-consistent electrical field. The doping profile is included as a
parametric field. To numerically solve a physically relevant local inverse
problem, we present three different data-driven approaches, based on least
squares, multilayer perceptrons, and residual neural networks. Our data-driven
methods reconstruct the doping profile for a given spatially varying voltage
signal induced by a laser scan along the sample's surface. The methods are
trained on synthetic data sets (pairs of discrete doping profiles and
corresponding photovoltage signals at different illumination positions) which
are generated by efficient physics-preserving finite volume solutions of the
forward problem. While the linear least square method yields an average
absolute $\ell^\infty$ error around $10\%$, the nonlinear networks roughly
halve this error to $5\%$, respectively. Finally, we optimize the relevant
hyperparameters and test the robustness of our approach with respect to noise.

ElecTra stands for 'ELECtronic TRAnsport' and computes the electronic and
thermoelectric transport coefficients electrical conductivity, Seebeck
coefficient, electronic thermal conductivity, and mobility, for semiconductor
materials, for both unipolar and bipolar (small bandgap) materials. The code
uses computed full-bands and relevant scattering parameters as inputs and
considers single crystal materials in 3D and 2D. The present version of the
code (v1) considers: i) elastic scattering with acoustic phonons and inelastic
scattering with non-polar optical phonons in the deformation potential
approximation, ii) inelastic scattering with polar phonons, iii) scattering
with ionized dopants, and iv) alloy scattering. The user is given the option of
intra- and inter-valley scattering considerations. The simulation output also
includes relevant relaxation times and mean-free-paths. The transport
quantities are computed as a function of Fermi level position, doping density,
and temperature. ElecTra can interface with any DFT code which saves the
electronic structure in the '.bxsf' format. In this paper ElecTra is validated
against ideal electronic transport situations of known analytical solutions,
existing codes employing the constant relaxation time approximation, as well as
experimentally well-assessed materials such as Si, Ge, SiGe, and GaAs.

previous estimations by using rest-frame UV luminosity functions (LFs)
corrected for the dust extinction with the IRX-$\beta$ relation, and is
comparable to that estimated from a far-infrared LF. This suggests that the
contribution of dust-obscured intensively star-forming galaxies to the total
star formation activities at $z\sim6$ is underestimated with the previous
approach based only on rest-frame UV observations. We parameterize the SFRF
with using the Schechter function and obtain the best-fit parameter of the
characteristic SFR (${\rm SFR}^*$) when the faint-end slope and characteristic
number density are fixed. The best-fit ${\rm SFR}^*$ is comparable to that at
$z\sim2$, when the cosmic star formation activity reaches its peak. Together
with SFRF estimations with similar approach using rest-frame UV to optical

decrease above $z\sim6$. Since the ${\rm SFR}^*$ is sensitive to the high-SFR

""shape fusion"" and ""dual-refinement"" modules to tackle the cross-modal

single images to guide the geometry generation of the missing regions of point
clouds, in which we propose IPAdaIN to embed the global features of both the
image and the partial point cloud into completion. The second module refines
the coarse output by adjusting the positions of the generated points, where the
local refinement unit exploits the geometric relation between the novel and the
input points by graph convolution, and the global constraint unit utilizes the
input image to fine-tune the generated offset. Different from most existing
approaches, CSDN not only explores the complementary information from images
but also effectively exploits cross-modal data in the whole coarse-to-fine
completion procedure. Experimental results indicate that CSDN performs
favorably against ten competitors on the cross-modal benchmark.

dynamics and study the consequences in terms of the properties of tumor growth
associated with the Warburg effect, mitosis and nutrient and space apoptosis.
As a result of the stochastic nature of this process, a fractal morphology is
observed in this region. Our results agree with experimental results for growth

  Q-learning: A Novel Correction Approach",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Compared to on-policy counterparts, off-policy model-free deep reinforcement
learning can improve data efficiency by repeatedly using the previously
gathered data. However, off-policy learning becomes challenging when the
discrepancy between the underlying distributions of the agent's policy and
collected data increases. Although the well-studied importance sampling and
off-policy policy gradient techniques were proposed to compensate for this
discrepancy, they usually require a collection of long trajectories and induce
additional problems such as vanishing/exploding gradients or discarding many
useful experiences, which eventually increases the computational complexity.
Moreover, their generalization to either continuous action domains or policies
approximated by deterministic deep neural networks is strictly limited. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel policy similarity measure to
mitigate the effects of such discrepancy in continuous control. Our method
offers an adequate single-step off-policy correction that is applicable to
deterministic policy networks. Theoretical and empirical studies demonstrate
that it can achieve a ""safe"" off-policy learning and substantially improve the
state-of-the-art by attaining higher returns in fewer steps than the competing
methods through an effective schedule of the learning rate in Q-learning and
policy optimization.

operations, but the parameters of some weight-equipped operations may not be
trained well in the initial stage, which causes unfair competition between
candidate operations. The weight-free operations appear in large numbers which
results in the phenomenon of performance crash. Besides, a lot of memory will
be occupied during training supernet which causes the memory utilization to be
low. In this paper, a partial channel connection based on channel attention for
differentiable neural architecture search (ADARTS) is proposed. Some channels
with higher weights are selected through the attention mechanism and sent into
the operation space while the other channels are directly contacted with the
processed channels. Selecting a few channels with higher attention weights can
better transmit important feature information into the search space and greatly
improve search efficiency and memory utilization. The instability of network
structure caused by random selection can also be avoided. The experimental
results show that ADARTS achieved 2.46% and 17.06% classification error rates

automation for neural network accelerators was proposed, where design space

extragalactic radio transients lasting for a few milliseconds. While over 600
FRBs have been published so far, their origins are presently unclear, with some
theories for extragalactic FRBs predicting accompanying high-energy emission.
In this work, we use the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)
Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) Project to explore whether any FRB-like radio
emission coincides in space and time with 81 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected
between 2018 July 17 and 2019 July 8 by Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM. We do not find
any statistically significant, coincident pairs within 3sigma of each other's
spatial localization regions and within a time difference of up to one week. In
addition to searching for spatial matches between known FRBs and known GRBs, we
use CHIME/FRB to constrain FRB-like radio emission before, at the time of, or
after the reported high-energy emission at the position of 39 GRBs. Our most
constraining radio flux limits in the 400- to 800-MHz band for short gamma-ray
bursts (SGRBs) are <50 Jy at 18.6 ks pre-high-energy emission, and <5 Jy at
28.4 ks post-high-energy emission, assuming a 10-ms radio burst width with each
limit valid for 60 seconds. We use these limits to constrain models that
predict FRB-like prompt radio emission before and after SGRBs. We also place
limits as low as 2 Jy for long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), but there are no
strong theoretical predictions for coincident FRB-like radio emission for
LGRBs.

classification and regression. For popular anchor-free detectors, it is common
to introduce an individual prediction branch to estimate the quality of
localization. The following inconsistencies are observed when we delve into the
practices of classification and quality estimation. Firstly, for some adjacent
samples which are assigned completely different labels, the trained model would
produce similar classification scores. This violates the training objective and
leads to performance degradation. Secondly, it is found that detected bounding
boxes with higher confidences contrarily have smaller overlaps with the
corresponding ground-truth. Accurately localized bounding boxes would be
suppressed by less accurate ones in the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)
procedure. To address the inconsistency problems, the Dynamic Smooth Label
Assignment (DSLA) method is proposed. Based on the concept of centerness
originally developed in FCOS, a smooth assignment strategy is proposed. The
label is smoothed to a continuous value in [0, 1] to make a steady transition
between positive and negative samples. Intersection-of-Union (IoU) is predicted
dynamically during training and is coupled with the smoothed label. The dynamic
smooth label is assigned to supervise the classification branch. Under such
supervision, quality estimation branch is naturally merged into the
classification branch, which simplifies the architecture of anchor-free
detector. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the MS COCO benchmark. It
is demonstrated that, DSLA can significantly boost the detection accuracy by
alleviating the above inconsistencies for anchor-free detectors. Our codes are

  Workshop",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Locally supervised learning aims to train a neural network based on a local
estimation of the global loss function at each decoupled module of the network.
Auxiliary networks are typically appended to the modules to approximate the

in terms of parallelism and reduced memory consumption, this paradigm of
training severely degrades the generalization performance of neural networks.
In this paper, we propose Periodically Guided local Learning (PGL), which
reinstates the global objective repetitively into the local-loss based training
of neural networks primarily to enhance the model's generalization capability.
We show that a simple periodic guidance scheme begets significant performance
gains while having a low memory footprint. We conduct extensive experiments on
various datasets and networks to demonstrate the effectiveness of PGL,

  Combining Interviews and App Store Analysis",,,,,"cs.SE cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Requirements are elicited from the customer and other stakeholders through an
iterative process of interviews, prototyping, and other interactive sessions.
Then, requirements can be further extended, based on the analysis of the
features of competing products available on the market. Understanding how this
process takes place can help to identify the contribution of the different
elicitation phases, thereby allowing requirements analysts to better distribute
their resources. In this work, we empirically study in which way requirements
get transformed from initial ideas into documented needs, and then evolve based
on the inspiration coming from similar products. To this end, we select 30
subjects that act as requirements analysts, and we perform interview-based
elicitation sessions with a fictional customer. After the sessions, the
analysts produce a first set of requirements for the system. Then, they are
required to search similar products in the app stores, and extend the
requirements, inspired by the identified apps. The requirements documented at
each step are evaluated, to assess to which extent and in which way the initial
idea evolved throughout the process. Our results show that only between 30\%
and 38\% of the requirements produced after the interviews include content that
can be fully traced to initial customer's ideas. Furthermore, up to 42\% of the
requirements inspired by the app stores cover additional features compared to
the ones identified after the interviews. The results empirically show that
requirements are not elicited in strict sense, but actually co-created through
interviews, with analysts playing a crucial role in the process. In addition,
we show evidence that app store-inspired elicitation can be particularly
beneficial to complete the requirements.

devices is always accompanied by polarization changes in the incident field,

theoretically and experimentally investigate polarization changes induced in
the transmitted field by a rotating K-mirror. For quantifying such polarization
changes, we define a quantity, mean polarization change D, which ranges from 0
to {\pi}. We find that K-mirrors can reduce D to about 0.03{\pi}, for any
incident state of polarization; however, reducing D to the same extent with a
Dove prism is practically unviable. Therefore, K-mirrors are better
alternatives to Dove prisms in applications in which the polarization changes
accompanying wavefront rotation need to be minimum.

To do this, we use a reduced $\chi ^2$ variability measure on > 10 epoch
lightcurves from the Zwicky Transient Facility and combine with spectroscopic
data and derived galaxy parameters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find
that below stellar mass of $10^{11} M_\odot$, galaxies classed as star-forming
via the BPT diagram have higher mean variabilities than AGN or composite
galaxies. Revealingly, the highest mean variabilities occur in star-forming
galaxies in a narrow range of specific star-formation,
$-11<\log($sSFR/yr$^{-1})<-10$. In very actively star-forming galaxies
$(\log($sSFR/yr$^{-1})>-10)$, the reduced variability implies a lack of
instantaneous correlation with star-formation rate. Our results may indicate
that a high level of variability, and thus black hole growth, acts as a
precursor for reduced star-formation, bulge growth, and revealed AGN-like
emission lines. These results add to the mounting evidence that optical
variability can act as a viable tracer for low-mass AGNs and that such AGNs can

2018, it was flaring in the very-high-energy (VHE; $E>100$ GeV) $\gamma$-ray
band, but no simultaneous neutrino event was detected. We model the observed
spectral energy distribution (SED), using a one-zone leptohadronic emission. We
estimate the neutrino flux through the restriction from observed X-ray flux on
the secondary radiation due to hadronic cascade, initiated by protons with
energy $E_p \lesssim 0.1$ EeV. We assume ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs;
$E\gtrsim0.1$ EeV), with the same slope and normalization as the low-energy
spectrum, are accelerated in the jet but escape efficiently. We propagate the
UHE protons in a random, turbulent extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF). The
leptonic emission from the jet dominates the GeV range, whereas the cascade
emission from CR interactions in the jet contributes substantially to the X-ray
and VHE range. The line-of-sight cosmogenic $\gamma$ rays from UHECRs produce a
hardening in the VHE spectrum. Our model prediction for neutrinos from the jet
is consistent with the 7.5-year flux limit by IceCube and shows no variability
during the MAGIC campaign. Therefore, we infer that the correlation between
GeV-TeV $\gamma$-rays and neutrino flare is minimal. The luminosity in CRs
limits the cosmogenic $\gamma$-ray flux, which, in turn, bounds the RMS value
of the EGMF to $\gtrsim 10^{-5}$ nG. The cosmogenic neutrino flux is lower than
the IceCube-Gen2 detection potential for 10 yrs of observation. VHE
$\gamma$-ray variability should arise from increased activity inside the jet;
thus, detecting steady flux at multi-TeV energies may indicate UHECR
acceleration. Upcoming $\gamma$-ray imaging telescopes such as the CTA will be
able to constrain the cosmogenic $\gamma$-ray component in the SED of TXS
0506+056.

efficiently, we propose a novel self-guided continual RL framework, RelayHER
(RHER). RHER first decomposes a sequential task into new sub-tasks with
increasing complexity and ensures that the simplest sub-task can be learned
quickly by utilizing Hindsight Experience Replay (HER). Secondly, we design a

Finally, we propose a Self-Guided Exploration Strategy (SGES). With SGES, the
learned sub-task policy will guide the agent to the states that are helpful to
learn more complex sub-task with HER. By this self-guided exploration and relay
policy learning, RHER can solve these sequential tasks efficiently stage by
stage. The experimental results show that RHER significantly outperforms
vanilla-HER in sample-efficiency on five singleobject and five complex

signature-based Gr\""obner basis algorithms, with the first of its kind
published in the late 1990s by Jean-Charles Faug\`ere under the name F5. In
addition to signature-based approaches, Rusydi Makarim and Marc Stevens
investigated a different direction to efficiently compute Gr\""obner bases,
which they published in 2017 with their algorithm M4GB. The ideas behind M4GB

current that is converted into an in-plane charge current and, thus, a
measurable THz electromagnetic pulse. The THz signal amplitude as a function of
the NbSe$_2$ thickness shows that the measured signals are fully consistent
with an ultrafast optically driven injection of an in-plane-polarized spin
current into NbSe$_2$. Modeling of the spin-current dynamics reveals that a
sizable fraction of the total S2C originates from the bulk of NbSe$_2$ with the
same, negative, sign as the spin Hall angle of pure Nb. By quantitative
comparison of the emitted THz radiation from F|NbSe$_2$ to F|Pt reference
samples and the results of ab-initio calculations, we estimate that the spin
Hall angle of NbSe$_2$ for an in-plane polarized spin current lies between
-0.2% and -1.1%, while the THz spin-current relaxation length is of the order
of a few nanometers.

support for affective computing and applications. However, most FER databases
are annotated with several basic mutually exclusive emotional categories and
contain only one modality, e.g., videos. The monotonous labels and modality
cannot accurately imitate human emotions and fulfill applications in the real
world. In this paper, we propose MAFW, a large-scale multi-modal compound
affective database with 10,045 video-audio clips in the wild. Each clip is
annotated with a compound emotional category and a couple of sentences that
describe the subjects' affective behaviors in the clip. For the compound
emotion annotation, each clip is categorized into one or more of the 11
widely-used emotions, i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness,
surprise, contempt, anxiety, helplessness, and disappointment. To ensure high
quality of the labels, we filter out the unreliable annotations by an
Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and then obtain 11 single-label
emotion categories and 32 multi-label emotion categories. To the best of our
knowledge, MAFW is the first in-the-wild multi-modal database annotated with
compound emotion annotations and emotion-related captions. Additionally, we
also propose a novel Transformer-based expression snippet feature learning
method to recognize the compound emotions leveraging the expression-change
relations among different emotions and modalities. Extensive experiments on
MAFW database show the advantages of the proposed method over other
state-of-the-art methods for both uni- and multi-modal FER. Our MAFW database

each participating node and weights of only the current training round are
maintained and synchronized among all nodes. We use Multi-Krum to enable
aggregating correct weights from honest nodes and use HotStuff to ensure the
consistency of the training round number and weights among all nodes. Besides,
we theoretically analyze the Byzantine fault tolerance, convergence, and
complexity of DeFL. We conduct extensive experiments over two widely-adopted

constant over the duration of $K$ packets. In this work, we relax this scenario
by allowing the dominant path AOA and path-loss (PL) to be time-variant.
Assuming a highway scenario with line of sight (LOS) propagation between

path quantities, including the PL, the relative distance-dependent phase shift
between antennas, and the AOA-dependent far-field function of the antennas.
Using these approximations, we analytically derive the ACN sum-SNRs as each one

a phase slope design rule that is robust against time variation of the dominant

correct locomotion mode on the test data with the utilization of time history

only by gravitational wave (GW) radiation. However, the high magnetic fields
with intensities of up to gigagauss measured in WDs alert a potential role of
the electromagnetic (EM) emission in the evolution of DWDs. We evaluate the
orbital dynamics of DWDs under the effects of GW radiation, tidal
synchronization, and EM emission by a unipolar inductor generated by the
magnetic primary and the relative motion of the non-magnetic secondary. We show
that the EM emission can affect the orbital dynamics for magnetic fields larger
than megagauss. We applied the model to two known DWDs, SDSS J0651+2844 and ZTF
J1539+5027, for which the GW radiation alone does not fully account for the
measured orbital decay rate. We obtain upper limits to the primary's magnetic
field strength, over which the EM emission causes an orbital decay faster than
observed. The contribution of tidal locking and the EM emission is comparable,
and together they can contribute up to $20\%$ to the measured orbital decay
rate. We show that the gravitational waveform for a DWD modeled as purely
driven by GWs and including tidal interactions and EM emission can have large
relative dephasing detectable in the mHz regime of frequencies relevant for
space-based detectors like LISA. Therefore, including physics besides GW
radiation in the waveform templates is essential to calibrate the GW detectors
using known sources, e.g., ZTF J1539+5027, and to infer binary parameters.

open-loop operation, a data-driven leader-following MAS representation is

extended to the case of guaranteeing an $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ performance. A

Existing works leverage contact maps to refine inaccurate hand-object pose

explicit 3D supervision which is seldom available and therefore, are limited to
constrained settings, e.g., where thermal cameras observe residual heat left on
manipulated objects. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised
framework that allows us to learn contact from monocular images. Specifically,
we leverage visual and geometric consistency constraints in large-scale
datasets for generating pseudo-labels in semi-supervised learning and propose
an efficient graph-based network to infer contact. Our semi-supervised learning
framework achieves a favourable improvement over the existing supervised
learning methods trained on data with `limited' annotations. Notably, our
proposed model is able to achieve superior results with less than half the

PointNet-based approach. We show benefits from using a contact map that rules
hand-object interactions to produce more accurate reconstructions. We further
demonstrate that training with pseudo-labels can extend contact map estimations
to out-of-domain objects and generalise better across multiple datasets.

wide range of phenomena and applications. Usually, optomechanical interaction
in such OMCCs is limited to a single optical mode and a unique mechanical mode.
In this sense, eliminating the single mode constraint - for instance, by adding
more mechanical modes - should enable more complex physical phenomena, giving
rise to a context of multimode optomechanical interaction. However, a general
method to produce in a controlled way multiple mechanical modes with large
coupling rates in OMCCs is still missing. In this work, we present a route to
confine multiple GHz mechanical modes coupled to the same optical field with
similar optomechanical coupling rates - up to 600 kHz - by OMCC engineering. In
essence, we increase the number of unit cells (consisting of a silicon
nanobrick perforated by a circular holes with corrugations at its both sides)

Remarkably, the mechanical modes in our cavities are located within a full

factors at cryogenic temperatures. The multimode bevavior in a full phononic

the spin directions in that dataset shows a statistical signal of $>2\sigma$.
Code and data for reproducing the analysis are publicly available. These
results are in agreement with other experiments with SDSS, Pan-STARRS, HST, and
the DESI Legacy Survey. The paper also examines other previous studies that
showed random distribution in galaxy spin directions. While further research
will be required, the current evidence suggest that large-scale asymmetry
between the number of clockwise and counterclockwise galaxies cannot be ruled
out.

the face of climate change. In terrestrial forests, tree height is primarily
determined by water availability, plant hydraulic design, and disturbance
regime. However, the role of water stress remains elusive in tidal
environments, where saturated soils are prevalent, and salinity can
substantially affect the soil water potential. Here, we use global observations
of maximum canopy height, species richness, air temperature, and seawater
salinity -- a proxy of soil water salt concentration -- to explain the causal
link between salinity and Mangrove stature. Our findings suggest that salt
stress affects Mangrove height both directly, by reducing primary productivity
and increasing the risk of xylem cavitation, and indirectly favoring more
salt-tolerant species, narrowing the spectrum of viable traits, and reducing
biodiversity. Yet, salt tolerance comes to a price. Highly salt-tolerant
mangroves are less productive and generally shorter than more sensitive
species, suggesting a causal nexus between salinity, biodiversity, and tree
height. As sea-level rise enhances coastal salinization, failure to account for
these effects can lead to incorrect estimates of future carbon stocks in
Tropical coastal ecosystems and endanger preservation efforts.

productive and yet fragile ecotones worldwide. Sea-level rise alters both
salinity and submersion regimes, threatening the future existence of these
habitats. Still, the magnitude of the impacts is elusive. A current paradigm is
that coastal communities will keep pace with sea-level rise through soil
accretion, a process largely sustained by the interaction of plants and
geomorphology. This thesis, however, rests on the assumption that submersion is
the main driver of bio-geomorphic processes and does not include the effects of
salinity on plant hydrologic function. Here, we show that salinity has a major
influence on how tidal vegetation controls the depth of the water table - a key
ecohydrological process regulating plant establishment, survival rate, and
productivity. Our findings rely on long-term observations from the Florida
Everglades and modeling results. They indicate that altered salinity regimes
can suppress transpiration, undermining in this way the ability of tidal
ecosystems to control water table movements and contrast other forms of plant
stress like waterlogging. This effect is apparent in the mangroves of the
Everglades' tidal fringe, where salinization has already yielded extensive
decoupling between plant hydraulics and groundwater dynamics. This mechanism
leads to shallow water tables and poor soil-aeration conditions, with sizable
impacts on coastal wetlands' hydrologic function and elasticity.

upon this intuition, a variety of models were developed to predict how
information propagates in OSN, similar to the way infection spreads in the
population. In this paper, we revisit this world view and arrive at new

a user $u \in V$ will re-share content by some $v \in V$ at the following time
window given the activity of all the users in $V$ in the previous time window.
We design several algorithms for this task, ranging from a simple greedy
algorithm that only learns $u$'s conditional probability distribution, ignoring
the rest of $V$, to a convolutional neural network-based algorithm that
receives the activity of all of $V$, but does not receive explicitly the social

argue that the superior robustness of ViT comes from the segmentation of its
input images; others say that the Multi-head Self-Attention (MSA) is the key to
preserving the robustness. In this paper, we aim to introduce a principled and
unified theoretical framework to investigate such an argument on ViT's
robustness. We first theoretically prove that, unlike Transformers in Natural
Language Processing, ViTs are Lipschitz continuous. Then we theoretically
analyze the adversarial robustness of ViTs from the perspective of the Cauchy
Problem, via which we can quantify how the robustness propagates through
layers. We demonstrate that the first and last layers are the critical factors
to affect the robustness of ViTs. Furthermore, based on our theory, we
empirically show that unlike the claims from existing research, MSA only
contributes to the adversarial robustness of ViTs under weak adversarial
attacks, e.g., FGSM, and surprisingly, MSA actually comprises the model's
adversarial robustness under stronger attacks, e.g., PGD attacks.

possible innovations. The framework makes predictions about the rate of
diversification of product portfolios, the rate of innovation, and the
distribution of innovations across organizations. The results suggest on the
one hand that the rate of innovation is approximately linear rather than
super-linear. This explains advantages of incumbent firms, but excludes the
emergence of ""winner takes all"" distributions. The results also suggest that
the rate of development of new types of products follows ""Heaps' law"", where
the share of new product types within organizations declines over time.
Instead, old firms become increasingly focused on a core set of products and
knowledge, as they age. Together these results suggest that declining product
diversity might be one explanation why large firms have seen their overall
innovation rates decline.

functions, i.e., eigenfunctions of $mu_1$ that are radial with respect to a

are boundary integrals of generalized Poisson kernels that, unlike the

compute these generalized Poisson kernels via Markov chains and their

the tensionless case of this equation has been shown to provide a different
universality class by itself. This class describes the -- intrinsically
anomalous -- scaling of one-dimensional (1D) fronts for several physical
systems that feature ballistic dynamics. In this work, we show that the
evolution of certain 1D fronts defined for a 2D Ising system also belongs to
the tensionless KPZ universality class. Nevertheless, the Ising fronts exhibit
multiscaling, at variance with the continuous equation. The discrete nature of
these fronts provides an alternative approach to assess the dynamics for the 2D
front case (for a 3D Ising system), since the direct integration of the
tensionless KPZ equation blows up in this case. In spite of the agreement
between the 1D scaling of the Ising fronts and the tensionless KPZ equation,
the fluctuation statistics in 1D and the full behavior in 2D are strongly
conditioned by boundary effects.

penetrate the companion star envelope without merging. By allowing the NS to
plunge through companions, the companion can be accelerated to have runaway
velocities up to $\sim10$ per cent above the theoretical upper limit considered
in classical binary disruption scenarios. The NS can capture and carry away up
to a few per cent of the companion envelope as it escapes, which may form
pulsar planets or cause outflows through accretion to heat the ejecta from

graph encodes the relevant structural properties of equations in a way that
facilitates insight and efficient computation using sparse linear algebra

the locally optimal, time varying linear feedback gains. Next, we leverage the
factor graph formulation to compute the locally optimal, time-varying Kalman
Filter gains, and finally combine the locally optimal linear control and

its characterization with high spatial resolution. To guarantee coverage of the

To overcome the limitations imposed by limited range of sensors and drone

that the latter is better for single drone systems whereas for multiple drones

distinguished from the insulating bulk states (FuKane07). By contrast, in a
topological superconductor (FuKane08,Qi,FuBerg,Oppen), much less is known about
the relationship between an edge supercurrent and the bulk pair condensate. Can
we force their pairing symmetries to be incompatible? In the superconducting
state of the Weyl semimetal MoTe$_2$, an edge supercurrent is observed as
oscillations in the current-voltage (\emph{I-V}) curves induced by fluxoid
quantization (Wang). We have found that the $s$-wave pairing potential of
supercurrent injected from niobium contacts is incompatible with the intrinsic
pair condensate in MoTe$_2$. The incompatibility leads to strong stochasticity
in the switching current $I_c$ as well as other anomalous properties such as an
unusual antihysteretic behavior of the ``wrong'' sign. Under supercurrent
injection, the fluxoid-induced edge oscillations survive to much higher
magnetic fields \emph{H}. Interestingly, the oscillations are either very noisy
or noise-free depending on the pair potential that ends up dictating the edge
pairing. Using the phase noise as a sensitive probe that eavesdrops on the
competiting bulk states, we uncover an underlying blockade mechanism whereby

There has thus been growing interest in the NMR community to use deep learning
to automate NMR data annotation. Due to similarities between NMR and audio

to NMR as well. Using a simulated amino acid dataset, we show that by swapping
out filter banks with a trainable convolutional encoder, acoustic signal
embeddings from speaker verification models can be used for amino acid
classification in 2D NMR spectra by treating each amino acid as a unique
speaker. On an NMR dataset comparable in size with of 46 hours of audio, we
achieve a classification performance of 97.7% on a 20-class problem. We also

locality can emerge by a process analogous to spontaneous symmetry breaking. We
discuss the relevance of this program to the arrow of time problem.
  In our toy model, we interpret the emergence of a tensor factorization as the
appearance of individual degrees of freedom within a previously
undifferentiated (raw) Hilbert space. Earlier work [5, 6] looked at the
emergence of locality in Hamiltonians only, and found strong numerical
confirmation of that raw Hilbert spaces of $\dim = n$ are unstable and prefer
to settle on tensor factorization when $n=pq$ is not prime, and in [6] even
primes were seen to ""factor"" after first shedding a small summand, e.g.
$7=1+2\cdot 3$. This was found in the context of a rather general potential
functional $F$ on the space of metrics $\{g_{ij}\}$ on $\mathfrak{su}(n)$, the
Lie algebra of symmetries. This emergence of qunits through operator-level
spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) may help us understand why the world seems
to consist of myriad interacting degrees of freedom. But understanding why the
universe has an initial Hamiltonian $H_0$ with a many-body structure is of
limited conceptual value unless the initial state, $|\psi_0\rangle$, is also
structured by this tensor decomposition. Here we adapt $F$ to become a
functional on $\{g,|\psi_0\rangle\}=(\text{metrics})\times (\text{initial

$|\psi_0\rangle$, where they simultaneously attain low entropy by settling on

DoF-NeRF, a novel neural rendering approach that can deal with shallow DoF

the aperture of lens following the principles of geometric optics. Such a
physical guarantee allows DoF-NeRF to operate views with different focus

enables direct manipulation of DoF effect by adjusting virtual aperture and
focus parameters. It is plug-and-play and can be inserted into NeRF-based

DoF-NeRF not only performs comparably with NeRF in the all-in-focus setting,

great success in video salient object detection (VSOD). However, they still
suffer from high computational costs or poor quality of the generated saliency
maps. To solve these problems, we design a space-time memory (STM)-based
network, which extracts useful temporal information of the current frame from
adjacent frames as the temporal branch of VSOD. Furthermore, previous methods
only considered single-frame prediction without temporal association. As a
result, the model may not focus on the temporal information sufficiently. Thus,
we initially introduce object motion prediction between inter-frame into VSOD.
Our model follows standard encoder--decoder architecture. In the encoding
stage, we generate high-level temporal features by using high-level features
from the current and its adjacent frames. This approach is more efficient than
the optical flow-based methods. In the decoding stage, we propose an effective
fusion strategy for spatial and temporal branches. The semantic information of
the high-level features is used to fuse the object details in the low-level
features, and then the spatiotemporal features are obtained step by step to
reconstruct the saliency maps. Moreover, inspired by the boundary supervision
commonly used in image salient object detection (ISOD), we design a
motion-aware loss for predicting object boundary motion and simultaneously
perform multitask learning for VSOD and object motion prediction, which can
further facilitate the model to extract spatiotemporal features accurately and
maintain the object integrity. Extensive experiments on several datasets
demonstrated the effectiveness of our method and can achieve state-of-the-art
metrics on some datasets. The proposed model does not require optical flow or
other preprocessing, and can reach a speed of nearly 100 FPS during inference.

of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), significantly rely on the
quality of sensing data. With an exponential increase in intelligent
applications for urban development and enterprises offering sensing-as-aservice
these days, it is imperative to provision for a shared sensing infrastructure
for better utilization of resources. However, a shared sensing infrastructure
that leverages low-cost sensing devices for a cost effective solution, still
remains an unexplored territory. A significant research effort is still needed
to make edge based data shaping solutions, more reliable, feature-rich and
costeffective while addressing the associated challenges in sharing the sensing
infrastructure among multiple collocated services with diverse Quality of
Service (QoS) requirements. Towards this, we propose a novel edge based data
pre-processing solution, named UniPreCIS that accounts for the inherent
characteristics of lowcost ambient sensors and the exhibited measurement
dynamics with respect to application-specific QoS. UniPreCIS aims to identify
and select quality data sources by performing sensor ranking and selection
followed by multimodal data pre-processing in order to meet heterogeneous
application QoS and at the same time reducing the resource consumption
footprint for the resource constrained network edge. As observed, the
processing time and memory utilization has been reduced in the proposed
approach while achieving upto 90% accuracy which is arguably significant as
compared to state-of-the-art techniques for sensing. The effectiveness of
UniPreCIS has been evaluated on a testbed for a specific use case of indoor
occupancy estimation that proves its effectiveness.

alternate of black hole whose structure involves three distinct regions, i.e.,
interior, exterior and thin-shell. We analyze these domains of a gravastar for
a particular model of this modified theory. In the inner region of a gravastar,
the considered equation of state defines that energy density is equal to
negative pressure which is the cause of repulsive force on the spherical shell.
In the intermediate shell, pressure and energy density are equal and contain
ultra-relativistic fluid. The inward-directed gravitational pull of thin-shell
counterbalance the force exerted by the inner region of a gravastar allowing
the formation of a singularity-free object. The Reissner-Nordstrom metric
presents the outer vacuum spherical domain. Moreover, we discuss the impact of
the charge on physical attributes of a gravastar such as the equation of state
parameter, entropy, proper length and energy. We conclude that singularity-free
solutions of charged gravastar are physically consistent in this modified

the distribution of the individual- and household-level attributes in the
actual population. Since the entire population's attributes are generally
unavailable, household travel survey (HTS) samples are used for population
synthesis. Synthesizing population by directly sampling from HTS ignores the
attribute combinations that are unobserved in the HTS samples but exist in the
population, called 'sampling zeros'. A deep generative model (DGM) can
potentially synthesize the sampling zeros but at the expense of generating
'structural zeros' (i.e., the infeasible attribute combinations that do not
exist in the population). This study proposes a novel method to minimize
structural zeros while preserving sampling zeros. Two regularizations are
devised to customize the training of the DGM and applied to a generative
adversarial network (GAN) and a variational autoencoder (VAE). The adopted
metrics for feasibility and diversity of the synthetic population indicate the
capability of generating sampling and structural zeros -- lower structural
zeros and lower sampling zeros indicate the higher feasibility and the lower
diversity, respectively. Results show that the proposed regularizations achieve
considerable performance improvement in feasibility and diversity of the
synthesized population over traditional models. The proposed VAE additionally
generated 23.5% of the population ignored by the sample with 79.2% precision
(i.e., 20.8% structural zeros rates), while the proposed GAN generated 18.3% of
the ignored population with 89.0% precision. The proposed improvement in DGM
generates a more feasible and diverse synthetic population, which is critical
for the accuracy of an activity-based model.

well-trained TDCA-network outperforms the gradient from backpropagation in
classification task under different settings on multiple datasets. In addition,
we successfully use a credit diffusing trick, which can keep training and
testing performance remain unchanged, to reduce parameter complexity of the
TDCA-network. More importantly, by comparing their trajectories in the
parameter landscape, we find that TDCA-network directly achieved a global
optimum, in contrast to that backpropagation only can gain a localized optimum.
Thus, our results demonstrate that TDCA-network not only provide a biological
plausible learning mechanism, but also has the potential to directly achieve
global optimum, indicating that top-down credit assignment can substitute

processes the RNA sequences by performing a k-mer analysis on the data and
further visualises and compares the results using selected dimensionality

hole using time-domain numerical simulations. Our work is based on the
perturbed 3+1 Einstein's equations up to the linear order. We show explicitly
that our perturbation equations are covariant under infinitesimal coordinate
transformations. Then we solve a symmetric second-order hyperbolic wave
equation with a spatially varying wave speed. As the wave speed in our wave
equation vanishes at the horizon, our formalism can naturally avoid boundary
conditions at the horizon. Our formalism also does not contain coordinate
singularities and, therefore, does not need regularity conditions. Then, based
on our code, we simulate both finite and continuous initially plane-fronted
wave trains passing through the Schwarzschild black hole. We find that for the
finite wave train, the wave zone of GWs is wildly twisted by the black hole.
While for the continuous wave train, unlike geometric optics, GWs can not be
sheltered by the back hole. A strong beam and an interference pattern appear
behind the black hole along the optical axis. Moreover, we find that the
back-scattering due to the interaction between GWs and the background curvature
is strongly dependent on the direction of the propagation of the trailing
wavefront relative to the black hole. Finally, for a realistic input waveform
generated by binary black holes, we find that the lensed waveform in the merger

open innovation benefits by also creating platforms, where OGD, related OSS,

objective of this study is to explore how public sector organizations in the
role of platform providers facilitate such collaboration in the form of OGD
ecosystems and how the ecosystem's governance may be structured to support the
collaboration. Method: We conduct an exploratory multiple-case study of two
such ecosystems, focused on OGD related to the Swedish labor market and public

The study presents governance structure and collaboration practices of the two

scalars can break the gauge invariance of the topological gravity action, thus
making a connection with Einstein's gravity. This review is about a
noncommutative (NC) star-product deformation of the four-dimensional AdS gauge
theory of gravity, including Dirac spinors and the Yang-Mills field. In
general, NC actions can be expanded in powers of the canonical noncommutativity
parameter $\theta$ using the Seiberg-Witten map. The leading-order term of the
expansion is the classical action, while the higher-order $\theta$-dependent
terms are interpreted as new types of coupling between classical fields due to
spacetime noncommutativity. We study how these perturbative NC corrections
affect the field equations of motion and derive some phenomenological
consequences, such as NC-deformed Landau levels of an electron. Finally, we

crucial. This work proposes a sampling, communication and prediction co-design
framework to minimize the communication load subject to a constraint on
tracking the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between a real-world device and its
digital model in the metaverse. To optimize the sampling rate and the
prediction horizon, we exploit expert knowledge and develop a constrained Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm, named Knowledge-assisted Constrained
Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic (KC-TD3) policy gradient algorithm. We validate
our framework on a prototype composed of a real-world robotic arm and its
digital model. Compared with existing approaches: (1) When the tracking error
constraint is stringent (MSE=0.002 degrees), our policy degenerates into the
policy in the sampling-communication co-design framework. (2) When the tracking
error constraint is mild (MSE=0.007 degrees), our policy degenerates into the
policy in the prediction-communication co-design framework. (3) Our framework
achieves a better trade-off between the average MSE and the average
communication load compared with a communication system without sampling and
prediction. For example, the average communication load can be reduced up to
87% when the track error constraint is 0.002 degrees. (4) Our policy
outperforms the benchmark with the static sampling rate and prediction horizon
optimized by exhaustive search, in terms of the tail probability of the
tracking error. Furthermore, with the assistance of expert knowledge, the
proposed algorithm KC-TD3 achieves better convergence time, stability, and
final policy performance.

policies designed by traffic operators, one needs reliable estimates of travel

rush hours) and non-recurrent events (e.g., traffic incidents) leads to
potentially substantial delays in highway travel times, we focus on a framework
capable of incorporating both effects. To this end, we propose to work with the
Markovian Velocity model (MVM), based on an environmental background process
that tracks both random and (semi-)predictable events affecting the vehicle
speeds in a highway network. We show how to operationalize this flexible
data-driven model in order to obtain the travel time distribution for a vehicle
departing at a known day and time to traverse a given path. Specifically, we
detail how to structure the background process and set the speed levels
corresponding to the different states of this process. First, for the inclusion
of non-recurrent events, we study incident data to describe the random
durations of the incident and inter-incident times. Both of them depend on the
time of day, but we identify periods in which they can be considered
time-independent. Second, for an estimation of the speed patterns in both
incident and inter-incident regime, loop detector data for each of the
identified periods is studied. In numerical examples that use road network
detector data of the Dutch highway network, we obtain the travel time
distribution estimates that arise under different traffic regimes, and
illustrate the advantages compared to traditional travel-time prediction
methods.

simulate crevasse growth in both grounded ice sheets and floating ice shelves.
The model incorporates the three elements needed to mechanistically simulate
hydrofracture of surface and basal crevasses: (i) a constitutive description
incorporating the non-linear viscous rheology of ice, (ii) a phase field
formulation capable of capturing cracking phenomena of arbitrary complexity,
such as 3D crevasse interaction, and (iii) a poro-damage representation to
account for the role of meltwater pressure on crevasse growth. A stress-based
phase field model is adopted to reduce the length-scale sensitivity, as needed
to tackle the large scales of iceberg calving, and to adequately predict
crevasse growth in tensile stress regions of incompressible solids. The
potential of the computational framework presented is demonstrated by
addressing a number of 2D and 3D case studies, involving single and multiple
crevasses, and considering both grounded and floating conditions. The
computational framework presented opens new horizons in the modelling of
iceberg calving and, due to its ability to incorporate incompressible
behaviour, can be readily incorporated into numerical ice sheet models for
projecting sea-level rise.

problem that hinges on the Ulam method. The usual description, which we will
call the Ulam-Galerkin method, is in terms of projection onto basis functions
that are characteristic functions supported over a fine grid of rectangles. In
these terms, the usual Ulam-Galerkin approach can be understood as density
estimation by the histogram method. Here we show that the problem can be recast
in statistical density estimation formalism. This recasting of the classical
problem, is a perspective that allows for an explicit and rigorous analysis of
bias and variance, and therefore toward a discussion of the mean square error.
