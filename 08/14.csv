through January 2020 to June 2022. The datasets analyzed here are sourced from
Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Netherlands, New Zealand, the UK,
and the USA. This paper finds that power-law $x^{-\mu}$, stretched exponential
$e^{-\alpha x^{\beta}}$, and a combination of power-law and stretched
exponential function $x^{6}e^{-\alpha x^{\beta}}$ can well describe such
distributions in different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic course. These three
mathematical models seem to be an indicator of the severity degree of the
COVID-19 pandemic within an area. The empirical results of this analysis
suggest important intrinsic dynamics underlying a physical complex network
where an infectious human virus spreads. And thus, this study will place strict
constraint for theoretical investigation on the dynamics of an infectious human
virus spreading in human interconnected society.

  Models",,,,,"cs.LG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In deep learning, different kinds of deep networks typically need different
optimizers, which have to be chosen after multiple trials, making the training
process inefficient. To relieve this issue and consistently improve the model
training speed across deep networks, we propose the ADAptive Nesterov momentum
algorithm, Adan for short. Adan first reformulates the vanilla Nesterov
acceleration to develop a new Nesterov momentum estimation (NME) method, which
avoids the extra overhead of computing gradient at the extrapolation point.
Then Adan adopts NME to estimate the gradient's first- and second-order moments
in adaptive gradient algorithms for convergence acceleration. Besides, we prove
that Adan finds an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point within
$O(\epsilon^{-3.5})$ stochastic gradient complexity on the non-convex
stochastic problems (e.g., deep learning problems), matching the best-known
lower bound. Extensive experimental results show that Adan consistently
surpasses the corresponding SoTA optimizers on vision, language, and RL tasks
and sets new SoTAs for many popular networks and frameworks, e.g., ResNet,
ConvNext, ViT, Swin, MAE, DETR, GPT-2, Transformer-XL, and BERT. More
surprisingly, Adan can use half of the training cost (epochs) of SoTA
optimizers to achieve higher or comparable performance on ViT, GPT-2, MAE,
e.t.c., and also shows great tolerance to a large range of minibatch size,
e.g., from 1k to 32k. Code is released at https://github.com/sail-sg/Adan, and
has been used in multiple popular deep learning frameworks or projects.

current frame is predicted from the already-encoded reference frames using
block-based motion estimation and compensation techniques. While this approach
can efficiently exploit the translation motion of the moving objects, it is
susceptible to other types of affine motion and object occlusion/deocclusion.
Recently, deep learning has been used to model the high-level structure of
human pose in specific actions from short videos and then generate virtual
frames in future time by predicting the pose using a generative adversarial
network (GAN). Therefore, modelling the high-level structure of human pose is
able to exploit semantic correlation by predicting human actions and
determining its trajectory. Video surveillance applications will benefit as
stored big surveillance data can be compressed by estimating human pose
trajectories and generating future frames through semantic correlation. This
paper explores a new way of video coding by modelling human pose from the
already-encoded frames and using the generated frame at the current time as an
additional forward-referencing frame. It is expected that the proposed approach
can overcome the limitations of the traditional backward-referencing frames by
predicting the blocks containing the moving objects with lower residuals.
Experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve on average up
to 2.83 dB PSNR gain and 25.93\% bitrate savings for high motion video

outcomes, in which subgroups of the population (e.g., defined by age, gender,

literature has focused on detecting such disparities through statistical
procedures for when the sensitive attribute is specified a priori. However,
this limits applicability in real-world settings where datasets are high
dimensional and, on top of that, sensitive attributes may be unknown. As a
remedy, we propose a data-driven framework called Automatic Location of
Disparities (ALD) which aims at locating disparities in machine learning. ALD
meets several demands from machine learning practice: ALD (1) is applicable to
arbitrary machine learning classifiers; (2) operates on different definitions
of disparities (e.g., statistical parity or equalized odds); (3) deals with
both categorical and continuous predictors; (4) is suitable to handle
high-dimensional settings; and (5) even identifies disparities due to
intersectionality where disparities arise from complex and multi-way
interactions (e.g., age above 60 and female). ALD produces interpretable
fairness reports as output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ALD based on
both synthetic and real-world datasets. As a result, ALD helps practitioners
and researchers of algorithmic fairness to detect disparities in machine
learning algorithms, so that disparate -- or even unfair -- outcomes can be
mitigated. Moreover, ALD supports practitioners in conducting algorithmic
audits and protecting individuals from discrimination.

computational models of biological object recognition. Their remarkable success
has helped vision science break new ground and consequently, recent efforts
have started to transfer this achievement to research on biological face
recognition. In this regard, face detection can be investigated by comparing
face-selective biological neurons and brain areas to artificial neurons and
model layers. Similarly, face identification can be examined by comparing in
vivo and in silico multidimensional face spaces. In the present review, we
summarize the first studies that used DCNNs to model biological face
recognition. Based on this body of novel findings, we conclude that DCNNs are
useful models that follow the general hierarchical organization of biological
face recognition in the ventral visual pathway and the core face network. In
two exemplary spotlights, we emphasize the unique scientific contributions of
these models. Firstly, studies on face detection in DCNNs propose that
elementary face-selectivity emerges automatically through feedforward
processing. Secondly, studies on face identification in DCNNs suggest that
experience and additional generative mechanisms facilitate this particular
challenge. Taken together, as this novel computational approach enables close
control of predisposition (i.e., architecture) and/or experience (i.e.,
training data), it may be suited to inform longstanding debates on the
substrates of biological face recognition.

tracked estimates and hence, predict the adversary's future steps. The purpose
of this paper and the companion paper (Part I) is to address the inverse
filtering problem in non-linear systems by proposing an inverse extended Kalman

second-order, Gaussian sum, and dithered forward EKFs. In particular, we derive
theoretical stability guarantees for the inverse second-order EKF using the
bounded non-linearity approach. To address the limitation of the standard
I-EKFs that the system model and forward filter are perfectly known to the
defender, we propose reproducing kernel Hilbert space-based EKF to learn the
unknown system dynamics based on its observations, which can be employed as an
inverse filter to infer the adversary's estimate. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the state estimation performance of the proposed filters using

scope of recent works of multiple testing literature to the high dimensional

with finite sample guarantees: it controls the FDR strongly and approximates
the oracle in terms of the power, with explicit remainder terms that are small
under mild conditions. In practice, AdaDetect can be used in combination with
any machine learning-based classifier, which allows the user to choose the most
relevant classification approach. We illustrate this with classical real-world

particularly efficient. The versatility of our method is also shown with an

we have analyzed the thermoelectric properties within the non-linear transport
regime. As the simplest mean-field approximation is insufficient for analyzing
thermoelectric properties in the Coulomb blockade regime, one needs to employ a
higher-order approximation to study strongly correlated QD-based heat engines.
Therefore initially, we have used the Hubbard-\Romannum{1} approximation to
study the quantum dot level position ($\epsilon_d$), thermal gradient ($\Delta
T$), and on-dot Coulomb interaction ($U$) dependence of the thermoelectric
properties. Furthermore, as a natural extension, we have used an approximation
beyond Hubbard-\Romannum{1} in the infinite-$U$ limit (strong on-dot Coulomb
repulsion) to provide additional insight into the operation of a more practical
quantum dot heat engine. Within this infinite-$U$ limit, we examine the role of
the symmetric dot-reservoir tunneling ($\Gamma$) and external serial load
resistance ($R$) in optimizing the performance of the strongly correlated
quantum dot heat engine. Our infinite-$U$ results show a good quantitative
agreement with recent experimental data for a quantum dot coupled to two

be re-trained as part of a neural architecture on task-specific data. Through
fine-tuning, BinBert learns how to apply the general knowledge acquired with
pre-training to the specific task.

detailed analysis of the lasing condition of different surface-plasmon modes
shows that there is an abrupt change in the gain required when modes become
nonradiative. Although radiative modes, subject to both radiation and ohmic
losses, are expected to require more gain compensation than nonradiative modes,
we find that, counterintuitively, gain compensation is greater for nonradiative
modes. This is explained in terms of a change in the distribution of fields

Finally, we assess the feasibility of our proposal by using a realist gain

sensitivity by means of an improved and sophisticated processing of the
digitized detector signals: Fast neutrons produce nuclear recoils in the
scintillation crystal. Corresponding signals are detectible and can be
distinguished from that of electronic interactions by pulse-shape
discrimination (PSD) techniques as used in experiments searching for weakly
interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Thermal neutrons are often captured in
iodine nuclei of the scintillator. The gamma-ray cascades following such
captures comprise a sum energy of almost 7 MeV, and some of them involve
isomeric states leading to delayed gamma emissions. Both features can be used
to distinguish corresponding detector signals from responses to ambient gamma
radiation. The experimental proof was adduced by offline analyses of pulse
records taken with a commercial RID. An implementation of such techniques in
commercial RIDs is feasible.

low power sensor that does not restrict the device battery life. Silicon
photodiodes (PD) and LEDs are commonly used as the interface devices in PPG
sensors; however, using of flexible organic devices can enhance the sensor
conformality and reduce the cost of fabrication. In most PPG sensors, most of
system power consumption is concentrated in powering LEDs, traditionally
consuming mWs. Using organic devices further increases this power demand since
these devices exhibit larger parasitic capacitances and typically need higher
drive voltages. This work presents a sensor IC for continuous SpO$_2$ and HR
monitoring that features an on-chip reconstruction-free sparse sampling
algorithm to reduce the overall system power consumption by $\sim$70\% while
maintaining the accuracy of the output information. The designed frontend is
compatible with a wide range of devices from silicon PDs to organic PDs with
parasitic capacitances up to 10 nF. Implemented in a 40 nm HV CMOS process, the
chip occupies 2.43 mm$^2$ and consumes 49.7 $\mu$W and 15.2 $\mu$W of power in
continuous and sparse sampling modes respectively. The performance of the
sensor IC has been verified \textit{in vivo} with both types of devices and the
results are compared against a clinical grade reference. Less than 1 bpm and
1\% mean absolute errors were achieved in both continuous and sparse modes of

fundamental \textit{d}-wave nature of the superconducting gap is unchanged by

the ocean to the surface requires a fracture through the entire ice shell
($\sim$10 km). Here we explore an alternative mechanism in which shear heating
within shallower tiger stripe fractures produces partial melting in the ice
shell and interstitial convection allows fluid to be ejected as geysers. We use
an idealized two-dimensional multiphase reactive transport model to simulate
the thermomechanics of a mushy region generated by an upper bound estimate for
the localized shear heating rate in a salty ice shell. From our simulations, we
predict the temperature, porosity, salt content, melting rate, and liquid
volume of an intrashell mushy zone surrounding a fracture. We find that the
rate of internal melting can match the observed $\rm H_2O$ eruption rate and
that there is sufficient brine volume within the mushy zone to sustain the
geysers for $\sim350$ kyr without additional melting. The composition of the
liquid brine is, however, distinct from that of the ocean, due to partial
melting. This shear heating mechanism for geyser formation applies to Enceladus

velocity measurements, I have used UVW velocities to further constrain their
membership, arriving at a final catalog of 169 candidates. I estimate that the
completeness of the survey is ~90% for spectral types of <=M7 (>=0.06 Msun).
The histogram of spectral types for the 32 Ori candidates exhibits a maximum at
M5 (~0.15 Msun), resembling the distributions measured for other young clusters
and associations in the solar neighborhood. The available UVW velocities
indicate that the association is expanding, but they do not produce a
well-defined kinematic age. Based on their sequences of low-mass stars in
color-magnitude diagrams, the 32 Ori association and Upper
Centaurus-Lupus/Lower Centaurus-Crux (UCL/LCC) are coeval to within +/-1.2 Myr,
and they are younger than the Beta Pic moving group by ~3 Myr, which agrees
with results from previous analysis based on the second data release of Gaia.
Finally, I have used mid-infrared (IR) photometry from the Wide-field Infrared

for the efficient treatment of moving targets with motion mitigation techniques
(such as breath-hold, rescanning, and gating). Energy and spot position change
time are limiting factors in reducing treatment time. In this study, we
designed a universal and dynamic energy modulator (ridge filter, RF) to broaden
the Bragg peak, to reduce the number of energies and spots required to cover
the target volume, thus lowering the treatment time. Methods Our RF unit
comprises two identical RFs placed just before the isocenter. Both RFs move
relative to each other, changing the Bragg peaks characteristics dynamically.
We simulated different Bragg peak shapes with the RF in TOPAS and validated
them experimentally. We then delivered single-field plans with 1Gy/fraction to
different geometrical targets in water, to measure the dose delivery time using
the RF and compare it with the clinical settings. Results Aligning the RFs in
different positions produces different broadening in the Bragg peak; we
achieved a maximum broadening of 2 cm. With RF we reduced the number of
energies in a field by more than 60%, and the dose delivery time by 50%, for
all geometrical targets investigated, without compromising the dose
distribution transverse and distal fall-off. Conclusions Our novel universal
and dynamic RF allows for the adaptation of the Bragg peak broadening for a
spot and/or energy layer based on the requirement of dose shaping in the target
volume. It significantly reduces the number of energy layers and spots to cover
the target volume, and thus the treatment time. This RF design is ideal for
ultra-fast treatment delivery within a single breath-hold (5-10 sec), efficient
delivery of motion mitigation techniques, and small animal irradiation with
ultra-high dose rates (FLASH).

Moreover, the addition of the CLF term `robustifies' the search for a

stabilize the system. We demonstrate our approach with two hardware examples

the communication hardware would be used only for preparing remote

program information, would be used for conducting remote gates. Based on the
observation, we develop a compiler framework to optimize the collective
communication happening in distributed quantum programs. In this framework, we
decouple the communication preparation process in communication hardware from
the remote gates conducted in computational hardware by buffering EPR pairs
generated by communication hardware in qubits of the computational hardware.
Experimental results show that the proposed framework can halve the

networks. Cascade size distribution is a basic and crucial characteristic of
systemic cascade behaviors. Recent research works have revealed that the
distribution of cascade sizes is a bimodal form indicating the existence of
either very small cascades or large ones. In this paper, we aim to understand
the properties and formation of such bimodal distribution of cascade sizes in
complex networks, and further predict the final cascade size. We first find
that the bimodal distribution of cascade sizes is ubiquitous in both synthetic
and real networks. Moreover, the large cascade sizes distributed in the right
peak of bimodal distribution are resulted from either the failure of nodes with
high load at the first step of the cascade or multiple rounds of cascades
triggered by the initial failure. Accordingly, we propose a hybrid load metric
(HLM), which combines the load of the initial broken node and the load of
failed nodes triggered by the initial failure, to predict the final size of
cascading failures. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of HLM by computing
the accuracy of identifying the cascades belonging to the right and left peaks
of the bimodal distribution. The results show that HLM is a better predictor

infinite-dimensional mapping with high-fidelity predictions and a controlled

model considered here consists of a polymer dumbbell in a sea of reactants. One
of the beads of the dumbbell is allowed to act as a catalyst for a chemical
reaction between the reactants. We show that the mean-squared displacement,
MSD, of the center of mass of this Janus dumbbell exhibits ballistic behavior
at time scales at which the concentration of reactant is large. The time scales
at which the ballistic behavior is observed in the MSD coincides with the time
scales at which the cross-correlation between the swimmer's orientation and the
direction of its displacement exhibit a maximum. Since the swimmer model was
inspired by the GENERIC framework it is possible to ensure that the entropy
generation is always positive and therefore the second law of thermodynamics is
obeyed.

division, motion and force sensing. The unique mechanical properties required
to perform such functions arise from the interactions between molecular motors
and semi-flexible polymeric filaments. Molecular motors can convert the energy
released in the hydrolysis of ATP into forces of up to pico-Newton magnitudes.
Moreover, the polymeric filaments that form active gels are flexible enough to
respond to Brownian forces, but also stiff enough to support the large tensions
induced by the motor-generated forces. Brownian forces are expected to have a
significant effect especially at motor activities at which stable
non-contractile in vitro active gels are prepared for rheological measurements.
Here, a microscopic mean-field theory of active gels originally formulated in
the limit of motor-dominated dynamics is extended to include Brownian forces.
In the model presented here Brownian forces are included accurately, at real
room temperature, even in systems with high motor activity. It is shown that a
subtle interplay, or competition, between motor-generated forces and Brownian
forces has an important impact in the mass transport and rheological properties
of active gels. The model predictions show that at low frequencies the dynamic
modulus of active gels is determined mostly by motor protein dynamics. However,
Brownian forces significantly increase the breadth of the relaxation spectrum
and can affect the shape of the dynamic modulus over a wide frequency range
even for ratios of motor to Brownian forces of more than a hundred. Since the
ratio between motor and Brownian forces is sensitive to ATP concentration, the
results presented here shed some light on how the transient mechanical response
of active gels changes with varying ATP concentration.

retrospectively studied 57 glioma patients with pre and postcontrast T1

tumors were segmented into enhancing and nonenhancing portions, tumor necrosis,
cyst and edema using semiautomated segmentation of ITK-SNAP open source tool.
We measured total tumor volume, enhancing-nonenhancing tumor, edema, necrosis
volume and the ratios to the total tumor volume. Training of a support vector
machine (SVM) classifier and artificial neural network (ANN) was performed with
labeled data designed to answer the question of interest. Specificity,
sensitivity, and AUC of the predictions were computed by means of ROC analysis.
Differences in continuous measures between groups were assessed by using
Kruskall Wallis, with post hoc Dunn correction for multiple comparisons.
Results; When we compared the volume ratios between groups, there was
statistically significant difference between grade IV and grade II-III glial
tumors. Edema and tumor necrosis volume ratios for grade IV glial tumors were
higher than that of grade II and III. Volumetric ratio analysis could not
distinguish grade II and III tumors successfully. However, SVM and ANN
correctly classified each group with accuracies up to 98% and 96%. Conclusion;
Application of machine learning methods to MRI features can be used to classify
brain tumors noninvasively and more readily in clinical settings.

representations and thus facilitating various graph-related tasks. However,
most GNN methods adopt a supervised learning setting, which is not always
feasible in real-world applications due to the difficulty to obtain labeled
data. Hence, graph self-supervised learning has been attracting increasing
attention. Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is a representative framework for
self-supervised learning. In general, GCL learns node representations by
contrasting semantically similar nodes (positive samples) and dissimilar nodes
(negative samples) with anchor nodes. Without access to labels, positive
samples are typically generated by data augmentation, and negative samples are
uniformly sampled from the entire graph, which leads to a sub-optimal
objective. Specifically, data augmentation naturally limits the number of
positive samples that involve in the process (typically only one positive
sample is adopted). On the other hand, the random sampling process would
inevitably select false-negative samples (samples sharing the same semantics
with the anchor). These issues limit the learning capability of GCL. In this
work, we propose an enhanced objective that addresses the aforementioned
issues. We first introduce an unachievable ideal objective that contains all
positive samples and no false-negative samples. This ideal objective is then
transformed into a probabilistic form based on the distributions for sampling
positive and negative samples. We then model these distributions with node
similarity and derive the enhanced objective. Comprehensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhanced

confounders may be inaccessible for measurement, we propose using contrastive
SSL to reduce exposure bias, specifically through the use of inverse propensity
scores and the expansion of the positive sample set. Based on theoretical
findings, we introduce a new contrastive counterfactual learning method (CCL)
that integrates three novel positive sampling strategies based on estimated

algorithmic framework for counterfactual inference, which brings an idea from
Meta-learning for Estimating Individual Treatment Effects (MetaITE) to fill the

Specifically, we regard data episodes among treatment groups in counterfactual
inference as meta-learning tasks. We train a meta-learner from a set of source
treatment groups with sufficient samples and update the model by gradient
descent with limited samples in target treatment. Moreover, we introduce two
complementary losses. One is the supervised loss on multiple source treatments.

proposed in recent years to resolve the so-called ``electron temperature and
abundance discrepancy problem'' in the study of planetary nebulae (PNe). Thus
the need to develop diagnostic tools to determine from observations the EED of
PNe is raised. Arising from high energy levels, the ultraviolet (UV) emission
lines from PNe present intensities that depend sensitively on the high-energy
tail of the EED. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using the
\ion{C}{2}]$\lambda$2326/\ion{C}{2}$\lambda$1335 intensity ratios as a
diagnostic of the deviation of the EED from the Maxwellian distribution (as
represented by the $\kappa$ index). We use a Maxwellian decomposition approach
to derive the theoretical $\kappa$-EED-based collisionally excited coefficients
of \ion{C}{2}, and then compute the \ion{C}{2} UV intensity ratio as a function
of the $\kappa$ index. We analyze the archival spectra acquired by the {\it
International Ultraviolet Explorer} and measure the intensities of \ion{C}{2}
UV lines from 12 PNe. By comparing the observed line ratios and the theoretical
predictions, we can infer their $\kappa$ values. With the Maxwellian-EED
hypothesis, the observed \ion{C}{2}]$\lambda$2326/\ion{C}{2}$\lambda$1335
ratios are found to be generally lower than those predicted from the observed
optical spectra. This discrepancy can be explained in terms of the $\kappa$
EED. Our results show that the $\kappa$ values inferred range from 15 to
infinity, suggesting a mild or modest deviation from the Maxwellian
distribution. However, the $\kappa$-distributed electrons are unlikely to exist
throughout the whole nebulae. A toy model shows that if just about 1--5 percent
of the free electrons in a PN had a $\kappa$-EED as small as $\kappa=3$, it
would be sufficient to account for the observations.

photon counting, measurements with coherent displacements that maximize
information gain as the measurement progresses, which have higher sensitivities
over the best known adaptive Gaussian strategies. To gain understanding about
their fundamental characteristics and demonstrate their superior performance,
we develop a comprehensive statistical analysis based on the Bayesian optimal

non-Gaussian strategies. This mathematical framework, together with numerical
analysis and Monte Carlo methods, allows us to determine the asymptotic limits
in sensitivity of strategies based on photon counting designed to maximize
information gain, which up to now had been a challenging problem. Moreover, we
show that these non-Gaussian phase estimation strategies have the same
functional form as the canonical phase measurement in the asymptotic limit
differing only by a scaling factor, thus providing the highest sensitivity
among physically-realizable measurements for single-shot phase estimation of
coherent states known to date. This work shines light into the potential of
optimized non-Gaussian measurements based on photon counting for optical

possesses several medical imaging applications but also can be considered a
model of general inverse problems to recover the object shape from limited
measured data. Several approaches such as the Mumford-Shah method and various
level-set methods have been investigated, but most of them lead to a non-convex
optimization due to the difficulty to handle the binary constraint. We propose
a new method based on a convex optimization inspired by dictionary-based shape
recovery. In the proposed method, the object boundary of the binary image is
represented by a level set of linear combinations of basis vectors in the
dictionary. Using the dictionary, the object boundary is reconstructed by
finding weights of the linear combination that best match the measured data. We
create the dictionary by using the Gaussian radial basis function (GRBF). More
concretely, we use Gaussian functions as a basis function placed at sparse grid
points to represent the parametric level-set function and provide more
flexibility in the binary representation of the reconstructed image. The
simulation results of CT image reconstruction from only four projection data
demonstrate that the proposed method can recover the object boundary more
accurately compared with other competitive methods. The significance of our
approach is the formulation with a tractable convex program while keeping
moderate mathematical rigorousness.

discovering wide area (WAN) hardware MAC addresses from home routers; 2)
correlating these MAC addresses with their WiFi BSSID counterparts of known

common penultimate provider router.
  We first obtain a large corpus of MACs embedded in IPv6 addresses via
high-speed network probing. These MAC addresses are effectively leaked up the
protocol stack and largely represent WAN interfaces of residential routers,
many of which are all-in-one devices that also provide WiFi. We develop a
technique to statistically infer the mapping between a router's WAN and WiFi
MAC addresses across manufacturers and devices, and mount a large-scale data
fusion attack that correlates WAN MACs with WiFi BSSIDs available in wardriving

Selected validation confirms a median geolocation error of 39 meters. We then
exploit technology and deployment constraints to extend the attack to a larger

parsed into semantically meaningful segments that correspond to important steps
of the demonstrated task. Existing video summarization datasets rely on manual
frame-level annotations, making them subjective and limited in size. To
overcome this, we first automatically generate pseudo summaries for a corpus of
instructional videos by exploiting two key assumptions: (i) relevant steps are
likely to appear in multiple videos of the same task (Task Relevance), and (ii)
they are more likely to be described by the demonstrator verbally (Cross-Modal
Saliency). We propose an instructional video summarization network that
combines a context-aware temporal video encoder and a segment scoring
transformer. Using pseudo summaries as weak supervision, our network constructs
a visual summary for an instructional video given only video and transcribed
speech. To evaluate our model, we collect a high-quality test set, WikiHow
Summaries, by scraping WikiHow articles that contain video demonstrations and
visual depictions of steps allowing us to obtain the ground-truth summaries. We
outperform several baselines and a state-of-the-art video summarization model
on this new benchmark.

dogma is the quantitative characterization of the dynamics of

may significantly affect their rapidity and reliability. To capture these
dynamics, we develop a novel method, lag-time analysis, for measuring in vivo
dynamics. The approach uses exponential growth as the stopwatch to resolve
dynamics in an asynchronous culture and therefore circumvents the difficulties
and potential artifacts associated with synchronization or fluorescent
labeling. Although lag-time analysis has the potential to be widely applicable
to the quantitative analysis of in vivo dynamics, we focus on an important
application: characterizing replication dynamics. To benchmark the approach, we
analyze replication dynamics in three different species and a collection of
mutants. We provide the first quantitative locus-specific measurements of fork
velocity, in units of kb per second, as well as replisome-pause durations, some
with the precision of seconds. The measured fork velocity is observed to be
both locus and time dependent, even in wild-type cells. In addition to
quantitatively characterizing known phenomena, we detect brief, locus-specific
pauses at rDNA in wild-type cells for the first time. We also observe temporal
fork velocity oscillations in three highly-divergent bacterial species.
Lag-time analysis not only has great potential to offer new insights into
replication, as demonstrated in the paper, but also has potential to provide
quantitative insights into other important processes.

is widely applied in the real-world. By facilitating labeled links of the graph
as the training data, numerous deep learning based link prediction methods have
been studied, which have dominant prediction accuracy compared with non-deep
methods. However,the threats of maliciously crafted training graph will leave a
specific backdoor in the deep model, thus when some specific examples are fed
into the model, it will make wrong prediction, defined as backdoor attack. It
is an important aspect that has been overlooked in the current literature. In
this paper, we prompt the concept of backdoor attack on link prediction, and
propose Link-Backdoor to reveal the training vulnerability of the existing link
prediction methods. Specifically, the Link-Backdoor combines the fake nodes
with the nodes of the target link to form a trigger. Moreover, it optimizes the
trigger by the gradient information from the target model. Consequently, the
link prediction model trained on the backdoored dataset will predict the link
with trigger to the target state. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets and five well-performing link prediction models demonstrate that the
Link-Backdoor achieves the state-of-the-art attack success rate under both
white-box (i.e., available of the target model parameter)and black-box (i.e.,
unavailable of the target model parameter) scenarios. Additionally, we testify
the attack under defensive circumstance, and the results indicate that the
Link-Backdoor still can construct successful attack on the well-performing link
prediction methods. The code and data are available at

  relativistic gravitation contributions",,,,,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.EP gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Of all the solar fundamental parameters (mass, diameter, gravity at the
surface,...), the gravitational moments have been quite often ignored in the
past, mainly due to the great difficulty to get a reliable estimate. Even
though the order of magnitude of the solar quadrupole moment $J_2$ is now known
to be $10^{-7}$, its accurate value is still discussed. Indeed, the expansion
in multipoles $J_{(l,~ l = 2, ...)}$ of the gravitational potential of a
rotating body affects the orbital motion of planets at a relativistic level. We
will recall here the recent progresses made in testing General Relativity
through the contribution of the first solar quadrupole moment. Using the
Eddington-Robertson parameters, we recall the constraints both on a theoretical
and experimental point of view. Together with $\gamma$, which encodes the
amount of curvature of space-time per unit rest-mass, the Post--Newtonian
Parameter $\beta$ contributes to the relativistic precession of planets. The
latter parameter encodes the amount of non-linearity in the superposition law
of gravitation. Even though in principle, it would be possible to extract $J_2$
from planetary ephemerides, we observe that it is significantly correlated with
other solution parameters (semi-major axis of planets, mass of asteroids...).
Focusing on the $J_2$ correlations, we show that in general, when ~$\beta$ and
~$\gamma$ are freed, the correlations ~[$\beta, J_2$] and ~[$\gamma, J_2$] are
$\approx$ 45\% and $\approx$ 55\% respectively. Moreover, all the planetary
dynamics-based values are biased by the Lense--Thiring effect, which has never
been modeled and solved for so far, but can be estimated to $\approx$ 7\%. It
is thus possible to get a good estimate of the solar quadrupole
moment:$1.66\times10^{-7}$$\leq$$J_2$$\leq$$2.32\times10^{-7}$.

However, with growing demands for such technologies, the limited energy

high cost and low energy efficiency for all the operators to each have their
own dedicated energy infrastructure, such as charging stations. In this paper,
we analyze a wireless charging infrastructure sharing strategy in UAV and
EV-involved networks. We consider a scenario where UAVs can charge in EV
charging stations and pay for the sharing fee. On the EVs' side, sharing
infrastructure can earn extra profit but their service quality, such as waiting
time, might slightly reduce. On the UAVs' side, if renting EV charging stations
can achieve an acceptable system performance, say high coverage probability,
while considering the cost, they may not need to build their dedicated charging
stations. In this case, we use tools from stochastic geometry to model the
locations and propose an optimization problem that captures the aforementioned
trade-offs between cost or profit and quality of service. Our numerical results
show that sharing infrastructure slightly increases the waiting time of EVs,
say within $5$ min, but dramatically decreases the waiting time of drones, say
more than $50$ min, and deploying more charging stations do achieve better
performances, but all these better performances are expected to cost more.

it based on training. Furthermore, we compute the explicit part of the solution

revolutionary technology that enables to manipulate wireless propagation
environment via smartly controllable low-cost reflecting surfaces. However, in
order to outperform conventional communication systems, an RIS-aided system
with solely passive reflection requires an extremely large surface. To meet
this challenge, the concept of active RIS, which performs simultaneous
amplification and reflection on the incident signal at the expense of
additional power consumption, has been recently introduced. In this paper,
deploying an active RIS, we propose a novel beamforming concept, over-the-air
beamforming, for RIS-aided multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO)
transmission schemes without requiring any pre/post signal processing hardware
designs at the transmitter and receiver sides. In the proposed over-the-air
beamforming-based transmission scheme, the reflection coefficients of the
active RIS elements are customized to maximize the sum-rate gain. To tackle
this issue, first, a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming
(QCQP) problem is formulated. Then, using semidefinite relaxation (SDR)
approach, this optimization problem is converted to a convex feasibility
problem, which is efficiently solved using the CVX optimization toolbox.
Moreover, taking inspiration from this beamforming technique, a novel high-rate
receive index modulation (IM) scheme with a low-complexity sub-optimal detector
is developed. Through comprehensive simulation results, the sum-rate and bit
error rate (BER) performance of the proposed designs are investigated.

In this work, we propose a hypergraph neural network model called DisenHCN to
bridge the above gaps. In particular, we first unify the fine-grained user
similarity and the complex matching between user preferences and spatiotemporal
activity into a heterogeneous hypergraph. We then disentangle the user
representations into different aspects (location-aware, time-aware, and
activity-aware) and aggregate corresponding aspect's features on the
constructed hypergraph, capturing high-order relations from different aspects
and disentangles the impact of each aspect for final prediction. Extensive
experiments show that our DisenHCN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by
14.23% to 18.10% on four real-world datasets. Further studies also convincingly
verify the rationality of each component in our DisenHCN.

requires triggering workflows based on the caller's intent (reason for call).
Timeliness of prediction is essential for a good user experience. The goal is
for a system to detect the caller's intent at the time the agent would have
been able to detect it (Intent Boundary). Some approaches focus on predicting
the output offline, i.e. once the full spoken input (e.g. the whole
conversational turn) has been processed by the ASR system. This introduces an
undesirable latency in the prediction each time the intent could have been
detected earlier in the turn. Recent work on voice assistants has used
incremental real-time predictions at a word-by-word level to detect intent

have very different characteristics. In this work, we propose to apply a method
developed in the context of voice-assistant to the problem of online real time

increasing attention from researchers. Generally, these methods usually assume
that the corrupted region masks of each frame are known and easily obtained.
However, the annotation of these masks are labor-intensive and expensive, which
limits the practical application of current methods. Therefore, we expect to
relax this assumption by defining a new semi-supervised inpainting setting,
making the networks have the ability of completing the corrupted regions of the
whole video using the annotated mask of only one frame. Specifically, in this
work, we propose an end-to-end trainable framework consisting of completion
network and mask prediction network, which are designed to generate corrupted
contents of the current frame using the known mask and decide the regions to be
filled of the next frame, respectively. Besides, we introduce a cycle
consistency loss to regularize the training parameters of these two networks.
In this way, the completion network and the mask prediction network can
constrain each other, and hence the overall performance of the trained model
can be maximized. Furthermore, due to the natural existence of prior knowledge
(e.g., corrupted contents and clear borders), current video inpainting datasets
are not suitable in the context of semi-supervised video inpainting. Thus, we
create a new dataset by simulating the corrupted video of real-world scenarios.
Extensive experimental results are reported to demonstrate the superiority of
our model in the video inpainting task. Remarkably, although our model is
trained in a semi-supervised manner, it can achieve comparable performance as
fully-supervised methods.

driven by additive and multiplicative noise defined on some \emph{unbounded
Poincar\'e domains}. There are two significant keys to study this topic: what
is the asymptotically autonomous limiting set of the time-section of random
attractors as time goes to negative infinity, and how to show the
precompactness of a time-union of random attractors over an \emph{infinite}
time-interval $(-\infty,\tau]$. We guess and prove that such a limiting set is
just determined by the random attractor of a stochastic Navier-Stokes equation
driven by an autonomous forcing satisfying a convergent condition. The uniform
""tail-smallness"" and ""flattening effecting"" of the solutions are derived in
order to justify that the usual asymptotically compactness of the solution
operators is \emph{uniform} over $(-\infty,\tau]$. This in fact leads to the
precompactness of the time-union of random attractors over $(-\infty,\tau]$.
The idea of uniform tail-estimates due to Wang \cite{UTE-Wang} is employed to
overcome the noncompactness of Sobolev embeddings on unbounded domains. Several

To aid the

March 2022 includes bounded parametric polymorphism via generic types. Go 1.18
implements generic types using combination of monomorphisation and call-graph
based dictionary-passing called hybrid. This hybrid approach can be viewed as
an optimised form of monomorphisation that statically generates specialised
methods and types based on possible instantiations. A monolithic dictionary
supplements information lost during monomorphisation, and it is structured
according to the program's call graph. Unfortunately, the hybrid approach still
suffers from code bloat, poor compilation speed, and limited code coverage.
  In this paper we propose and formalise a new non-specialising call-site based
dictionary-passing translation. Our call-site based translation creates
individual dictionaries for each type parameter, with dictionary construction
occurring in place of instantiation, overcoming the limitations of hybrid. We
prove it correct using a novel and general bisimulation up to technique. To
better understand how different generics translations approaches work in
practice, we benchmark five translators, Go 1.18, two existing monomorphisation
translators, our dictionary-passing translator, and erasure translator. Our
findings reveal several suggestions for improvements for Go 1.18 --
specifically how to overcome the expressiveness limitations of generic Go, and
improve compile time and compiled code size performance of Go 1.18.

arriving times and lengths of the jobs. Stochastic online scheduling is a
well-established model capturing this. Here the arrivals occur online, while
the processing times are random. For this model, Gupta, Moseley, Uetz, and Xie
recently devised an efficient policy for non-preemptive scheduling on unrelated
machines with the objective to minimize the expected total weighted completion
time. We improve upon this policy by adroitly combining greedy job assignment
with $\alpha_j$-point scheduling on each machine. In this way we obtain a
$(3+\sqrt 5)(2+\Delta)$-competitive deterministic and an
$(8+4\Delta)$-competitive randomized stochastic online scheduling policy, where
$\Delta$ is an upper bound on the squared coefficients of variation of the
processing times. We also give constant performance guarantees for these
policies within the class of all fixed-assignment policies. The
$\alpha_j$-point scheduling on a single machine can be enhanced when the upper
bound $\Delta$ is known a priori or the processing times are known to be
$\delta$-NBUE for some $\delta \ge 1$. This implies improved competitive ratios
for unrelated machines but may also be of independent interest.

aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking even with state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers since
the potential image features are hard to extract under adverse light
conditions. Besides, due to the low visibility, accurate online selection of
the object also becomes extremely difficult for human monitors to initialize
UAV tracking in ground control stations. To solve these problems, this work
proposes a novel enhancer, i.e., HighlightNet, to light up potential objects
for both human operators and UAV trackers. By employing Transformer,
HighlightNet can adjust enhancement parameters according to global features and
is thus adaptive for the illumination variation. Pixel-level range mask is
introduced to make HighlightNet more focused on the enhancement of the tracking
object and regions without light sources. Furthermore, a soft truncation
mechanism is built to prevent background noise from being mistaken for crucial
features. Evaluations on image enhancement benchmarks demonstrate HighlightNet
has advantages in facilitating human perception. Experiments on the public
UAVDark135 benchmark show that HightlightNet is more suitable for UAV tracking
tasks than other SOTA low-light enhancers. In addition, real-world tests on a
typical UAV platform verify HightlightNet's practicability and efficiency in
nighttime aerial tracking-related applications. The code and demo videos are

synthesis. The learning procedure usually costs lots of time, which motivates
the latest methods to speed up the learning procedure by learning without

specially designed approaches do not work for most of radiance fields based
methods. To resolve this issue, we introduce a general strategy to speed up the
learning procedure for almost all radiance fields based methods. Our key idea
is to reduce the redundancy by shooting much fewer rays in the multi-view
volume rendering procedure which is the base for almost all radiance fields
based methods. We find that shooting rays at pixels with dramatic color change
not only significantly reduces the training burden but also barely affects the
accuracy of the learned radiance fields. In addition, we also adaptively
subdivide each view into a quadtree according to the average rendering error in
each node in the tree, which makes us dynamically shoot more rays in more
complex regions with larger rendering error. We evaluate our method with
different radiance fields based methods under the widely used benchmarks.
Experimental results show that our method achieves comparable accuracy to the
state-of-the-art with much faster training.

Here, we demonstrate that optomechanical ground state cooling in a continuous

mechanical dissipation exceeds optical dissipation which is the common case in
optical waveguides. The cooling is achieved in an anti-Stokes backward
Brillouin process by modulating the intensity of the optomechanical coupling
via a pulsed pump to suppress heating processes in the strong coupling regime.
With such dynamic modulation, a cooling factor with several orders of magnitude
can be realized, which breaks the steady-state cooling limit. This modulation
scheme can also be applied to Brillouin cooling generated by forward intermodal
Brillouin scattering.

efficient deployment also necessitates a large amount of (labeled or unlabeled)

framework for training a high-quality compact model that leverages the
knowledge acquired by pretrained generative models, while obviating the need to
go through a large volume of data. TGT exploits the fact that the teacher has
acquired a good representation of the underlying data domain, which typically
corresponds to a much lower dimensional manifold than the input space.
Furthermore, we can use the teacher to explore input space more efficiently
through sampling or gradient-based methods; thus, making TGT especially
attractive for limited data or long-tail settings. We formally capture this
benefit of proposed data-domain exploration in our generalization bounds. We
find that TGT can improve accuracy on several image classification benchmarks

the shortage of pathologists in ROSE. However, the cancerous patterns vary
significantly between different samples, making the CAD task extremely

color distribution, brightness, and contrast due to different staining
qualities and various acquisition device types. To address these challenges, we
proposed a shuffle instances-based Vision Transformer (SI-ViT) approach, which
can reduce the perturbations and enhance the modeling among the instances. With
the regrouped bags of shuffle instances and their bag-level soft labels, the
approach utilizes a regression head to make the model focus on the cells rather

head, the model can effectively identify the general distributive patterns
among different instances. The results demonstrate significant improvements in
the classification accuracy with more accurate attention regions, indicating
that the diverse patterns of ROSE images are effectively extracted, and the
complicated perturbations are significantly reduced. It also suggests that the

  Low-Latency Communications","30 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Low-rate and short-packet transmissions are important for ultra-reliable
low-latency communications (URLLC). In this paper, we put forth a new family of
sparse superposition codes for URLLC, called block orthogonal sparse
superposition (BOSS) codes. We first present a code construction method for the
efficient encoding of BOSS codes. The key idea is to construct codewords by the
superposition of the orthogonal columns of a dictionary matrix with a
sequential bit mapping strategy. We also propose an approximate maximum a
posteriori probability (MAP) decoder with two stages. The approximate MAP
decoder reduces the decoding latency significantly via a parallel decoding
structure while maintaining a comparable decoding complexity to the successive
cancellation list (SCL) decoder of polar codes. Furthermore, to gauge the code
performance in the finite-blocklength regime, we derive an exact analytical
expression for block-error rates (BLERs) for single-layered BOSS codes in terms
of relevant code parameters. Lastly, we present a cyclic redundancy check
aided-BOSS (CA-BOSS) code with simple list decoding to boost the code
performance. Our experiments verify that CA-BOSS with the simple list decoder
outperforms CA-polar codes with SCL decoding in the low-rate and
finite-blocklength regimes while achieving the finite-blocklength capacity
upper bound within one dB of signal-to-noise ratio.

  Truncation",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In prevalent cohort studies with follow-up, the time-to-event outcome is
subject to left truncation leading to selection bias. For estimation of the
distribution of time-to-event, conventional methods adjusting for left
truncation tend to rely on the (quasi-)independence assumption that the
truncation time and the event time are ""independent"" on the observed region.
This assumption is violated when there is dependence between the truncation
time and the event time possibly induced by measured covariates. Inverse
probability of truncation weighting leveraging covariate information can be
used in this case, but it is sensitive to misspecification of the truncation
model. In this work, we apply the semiparametric theory to find the efficient
influence curve of an expected (arbitrarily transformed) survival time in the
presence of covariate-induced dependent left truncation. We then use it to
construct estimators that are shown to enjoy double-robustness properties. Our
work represents the first attempt to construct doubly robust estimators in the
presence of left truncation, which does not fall under the established
framework of coarsened data where doubly robust approaches are developed. We
provide technical conditions for the asymptotic properties that appear to not
have been carefully examined in the literature for time-to-event data, and
study the estimators via extensive simulation. We apply the estimators to two
data sets from practice, with different right-censoring patterns.

well-known clustering problems, namely $k$-Median and $k$-Means. In $k$-Median,
the input consists of a set $X$ of $n$ points belonging to a metric space, and
the task is to select a subset $C \subseteq X$ of $k$ points as centers, such
that the sum of the distances of every point to its nearest center is
minimized. In $k$-Means, the objective is to minimize the sum of squares of the
distances instead. It is easy to design an algorithm running in time
$\max_{k\leq n} {n \choose k} n^{O(1)} = O^*(2^n)$ ($O^*(\cdot)$ notation hides
polynomial factors in $n$). We design first non-trivial exact algorithms for
these problems. In particular, we obtain an $O^*((1.89)^n)$ time exact
algorithm for $k$-Median that works for any value of $k$. Our algorithm is
quite general in that it does not use any properties of the underlying (metric)
space -- it does not even require the distances to satisfy the triangle
inequality. In particular, the same algorithm also works for $k$-Means. We
complement this result by showing that the running time of our algorithm is
asymptotically optimal, up to the base of the exponent. That is, unless ETH
fails, there is no algorithm for these problems running in time $2^{o(n)} \cdot
n^{O(1)}$.
  Finally, we consider the ""supplier"" versions of these clustering problems,
where, in addition to the set $X$ we are additionally given a set of $m$
candidate centers $F$, and objective is to find a subset of $k$ centers from
$F$. The goal is still to minimize the $k$-Median/$k$-Means/$k$-Center
objective. For these versions we give a $O(2^n (mn)^{O(1)})$ time algorithms
using subset convolution. We complement this result by showing that, under the
Set Cover Conjecture, the supplier versions of these problems do not admit an
exact algorithm running in time $2^{(1-\epsilon) n} (mn)^{O(1)}$.

to restart from the initial configuration intermittently according to an
external timer that does not require control by the walkers. In particular, the
resetting coordinates are either quenched (fixed) or annealed (fluctuating)
over the entire topography. Although the strategy relies upon simple rules, it
shows a significant ramification on the search time statistics in contrast to
the original search. We show that the resetting driven protocols mitigate the
performance of these active searchers based, robustly, on the inherent search
time fluctuations. Notably, for the annealed condition, resetting is always
found to expedite the search process. These features, as well as their
applicability to more general optimization problems starting from queuing
systems, computer science to living systems, make resetting based strategies

(UIQA) method, abbreviated as URanker. The URanker is built on the efficient
conv-attentional image Transformer. In terms of underwater images, we specially
devise (1) the histogram prior that embeds the color distribution of an
underwater image as histogram token to attend global degradation and (2) the
dynamic cross-scale correspondence to model local degradation. The final
prediction depends on the class tokens from different scales, which
comprehensively considers multi-scale dependencies. With the margin ranking
loss, our URanker can accurately rank the order of underwater images of the
same scene enhanced by different underwater image enhancement (UIE) algorithms
according to their visual quality. To achieve that, we also contribute a
dataset, URankerSet, containing sufficient results enhanced by different UIE
algorithms and the corresponding perceptual rankings, to train our URanker.
Apart from the good performance of URanker, we found that a simple U-shape UIE
network can obtain promising performance when it is coupled with our
pre-trained URanker as additional supervision. In addition, we also propose a
normalization tail that can significantly improve the performance of UIE

networks in dynamic environments. The shadowing by a human body results in
significant received power degradation and could occur abruptly and frequently.
A shadowing period of hundred milliseconds might interrupt the communication
and cause significant data loss, considering the huge bandwidth utilized in
mmWave communications. An even longer shadowing period might cause a
long-duration link outage. Therefore, a blockage prediction mechanism has to be
taken to detect the moving blocker within the vicinity of mmWave links. By
detecting the potential blockage as early as possible, a user equipment can
anticipate by establishing a new connection and performing beam training with
an alternative base station before shadowing happens. This paper proposes an
early moving blocker detection mechanism by leveraging an extra guard beam to
protect the main communication beam. The guard beam is intended to sense the
environment by expanding the field of view of a base station. The blockage can
be detected early by observing received signal fluctuation resulting from the
blocker's presence within the field of view. We derive a channel model for the
pre-shadowing event, design a moving blockage detection algorithm for the guard
beam, and evaluate the performance of the guard beam theoretically and
experimentally based on the measurement campaign using our mmWave testbed. Our
results demonstrate that the guard beam can extend the detection range and

real economics. We regard collective economic variables, collective
transactions and expectations, mean risks of economic variables and
transactions, collective velocities and flows of economic variables,
transactions and expectations as overlooked factors of economic evolution. We
introduce market-based probability of the asset price and consider unnoticed
influence of market stochasticity on randomness of macroeconomic variables. We
introduce economic domain composed by continuous numeric risk grades and
outline that the bounds of the economic domain result in unnoticed inherent
cyclical motion of collective variables, transactions and expectations those
are responsible for observed business cycles. Our treatment of unnoticed and
overlooked factors of theoretical economics and policy decisions preserves a
wide field of studies for many decades for academic researchers, economic
authorities and high-level politicians.

  Bitcoin Network","21 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.CR math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Many of the recent works on the profitability of rogue mining strategies
hinge on a parameter called $\gamma$ that measures the proportion of the honest
network attracted by the attacker to mine on top of his fork. These works, see
arXiv:1808.01041 and arXiv.1805.08281, have surmised conclusions based on
premises that erroneously treat $\gamma$ to be constant. In this paper, we
treat $\gamma$ as a stochastic process and attempt to find its distribution
through a Markov analysis. We begin by making strong assumptions on gamma's
behaviour and proceed to translate them mathematically in order to apply them
in a Markov setting. The aforementioned is executed in two separate occasions
for two different models. Furthermore, we model the Bitcoin network and
numerically derive a limiting distribution whereby the relative accuracy of our
models is tested through a likelihood analysis. Finally, we conclude that even
with control of 20% of the total hashrate, honest mining is the strongly
dominant strategy.

  Data Poisoning Attacks",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A powerful category of (invisible) data poisoning attacks modify a subset of
training examples by small adversarial perturbations to change the prediction
of certain test-time data. Existing defense mechanisms are not desirable to
deploy in practice, as they often either drastically harm the generalization
performance, or are attack-specific, and prohibitively slow to apply. Here, we
propose a simple but highly effective approach that unlike existing methods
breaks various types of invisible poisoning attacks with the slightest drop in
the generalization performance. We make the key observation that attacks
introduce local sharp regions of high training loss, which when minimized,
results in learning the adversarial perturbations and makes the attack
successful. To break poisoning attacks, our key idea is to alleviate the sharp
loss regions introduced by poisons. To do so, our approach comprises two
components: an optimized friendly noise that is generated to maximally perturb
examples without degrading the performance, and a randomly varying noise
component. The combination of both components builds a very light-weight but
extremely effective defense against the most powerful triggerless targeted and
hidden-trigger backdoor poisoning attacks, including Gradient Matching,
Bulls-eye Polytope, and Sleeper Agent. We show that our friendly noise is
transferable to other architectures, and adaptive attacks cannot break our
defense due to its random noise component.

  Unreliable Clients in Federated Learning","European Symposium on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS) 2022",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning offers a framework of training a machine learning model in
a distributed fashion while preserving privacy of the participants. As the
server cannot govern the clients' actions, nefarious clients may attack the
global model by sending malicious local gradients. In the meantime, there could
also be unreliable clients who are benign but each has a portion of low-quality
training data (e.g., blur or low-resolution images), thus may appearing similar
as malicious clients. Therefore, a defense mechanism will need to perform a
three-fold differentiation which is much more challenging than the conventional
(two-fold) case. This paper introduces MUD-HoG, a novel defense algorithm that
addresses this challenge in federated learning using long-short history of
gradients, and treats the detected malicious and unreliable clients
differently. Not only this, but we can also distinguish between targeted and
untargeted attacks among malicious clients, unlike most prior works which only
consider one type of the attacks. Specifically, we take into account
sign-flipping, additive-noise, label-flipping, and multi-label-flipping
attacks, under a non-IID setting. We evaluate MUD-HoG with six state-of-the-art
methods on two datasets. The results show that MUD-HoG outperforms all of them
in terms of accuracy as well as precision and recall, in the presence of a
mixture of multiple (four) types of attackers as well as unreliable clients.
Moreover, unlike most prior works which can only tolerate a low population of
harmful users, MUD-HoG can work with and successfully detect a wide range of
malicious and unreliable clients - up to 47.5% and 10%, respectively, of the
total population. Our code is open-sourced at

development of cardiovascular models for blood flow simulations. The
three-element Windkessel model is usually employed as a lumped boundary
condition, providing a reduced order representation of the peripheral
circulation. However, the systematic estimation of the Windkessel parameters
remains an open problem. Moreover, the Windkessel model is not always adequate
to model blood flow dynamics, which often require more elaborate boundary
conditions. In this study, we propose a method for the estimation of high order
boundary conditions, including the Windkessel model, and we investigate their
use. The proposed technique is based on Time-Domain Vector Fitting, a modeling
algorithm that, given samples of the input and output of a system, such as
pressure and flow waveforms, can derive a differential equation approximating
their relation. The capability of the proposed method is tested on a 1D
circulation model consisting of the 55 largest arteries, to demonstrate its
accuracy and the usefulness of estimating boundary conditions with order higher
than the traditional Windkessel models. The proposed method is verified against
other common estimation techniques, and its robustness in parameter estimation
is verified in presence of noisy data and of physiological changes of aortic
flow rate induced by mental stress. Results suggest that the proposed method is
able to accurately estimate boundary conditions of arbitrary order. Higher
order boundary conditions can improve the accuracy of cardiovascular
simulations, and Time-Domain Vector Fitting can automatically estimate them.

used in an agricultural thresher machine using a cubic B-spline curve and the

in modern machines. Shape optimization of the flywheel was carried out using a
cubic B-spline curve to maximize the kinetic energy of the flywheel subjected
to constraints of mass of flywheel and permissible value of Von-Mises stress in
a flywheel. The B-spline curve was used as it gives local control and is not
restricted by control points. The control points of the B-spline are considered
design variables. The Von-Mises stresses at all points in the flywheel are
determined by solving two-point boundary value differential equations using the
finite difference method. Finally, the optimization problem was solved using
the Jaya algorithm. These results are then compared with results obtained using
other nature-inspired algorithms like a genetic algorithm (GA), and particle

by the small fraction of experimentally determined protein or complex

expensive due to 3D representations of both molecule and protein. Here, we
demonstrate a widely used and fast protein sequence-based reinforcement
learning (RL) model for drug discovery. In the generative model, one of the
reward components, a binding affinity predictor, is based on 1D protein
sequence and molecular SMILES. As a proof of concept, the RL model was utilized
to design molecules for four targets. The generated compounds showed
bioactivities by the validation of both QSAR and molecular docking with
experimental 3D binding pockets. We also found that the performance of
generated molecules depends on the selection of data source training for the
binding predictor. Furthermore, drug design for a kinase without any
