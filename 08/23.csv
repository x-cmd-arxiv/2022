the report of superconductivity in LaH10 at near-ambient temperatures and high

studies on this system, supported by density functional theory calculations,
which reveal an unexpected chemical and structural diversity of lanthanum
hydrides synthesized in the range of 50 to 180 GPa. Seven lanthanum hydrides
were produced, LaH3, LaH~4, LaH4+{\delta}, La4H23, LaH6+{\delta},
LaH9+{\delta}, and LaH10+{\delta}, and the atomic coordinates of lanthanum in
their structures determined. The regularities in rare-earth element hydrides
unveiled here provide clues to guide the search for other synthesizable
hydrides and candidate high-temperature superconductors. The hydrogen content
variability in lanthanum hydrides and the samples' phase heterogeneity
underline the challenges related to assessing potentially superconducting
phase(s) and the nature of electronic transitions in high-pressure hydrides.

alone. The $E_G$ statistic provides an elegant way of testing the consistency
of General Relativity by comparing the geometry of the Universe, probed through
gravitational lensing, with the motion of galaxies in that geometry. Current
$E_G$ estimators combine galaxy clustering with gravitational lensing, measured
either from cosmic shear or from CMB lensing. In this paper, we construct a
novel estimator for $E_G$, using only clustering information obtained from two
tracers of the large-scale structure: intensity mapping and galaxy clustering.
In this estimator, both the velocity of galaxies and gravitational lensing are
measured through their impact on clustering. We show that with this estimator,
we can suppress the contaminations that affect other $E_G$ estimators and
consequently test the validity of General Relativity robustly. We forecast that
with the coming generation of surveys like HIRAX and Euclid, we will measure
$E_G$ with a precision of up to 7% (3.9% for the more futuristic SKA2).

damaged an arbitrary subset of the edges, the network operator must find a
spanning tree of the network using non-damaged edges by making as few checks as
possible.
  Motivated by such questions, we study the problem of finding a spanning tree
in a network, when we only have access to noisy queries of the form ""Does edge
e exist?"". We design efficient algorithms, even when edges fail adversarially,
for all possible error regimes; 2-sided error (where any answer might be
erroneous), false positives (where ""no"" answers are always correct) and false
negatives (where ""yes"" answers are always correct). In the first two regimes we
provide efficient algorithms and give matching lower bounds for general graphs.
In the False Negative case we design efficient algorithms for large interesting
families of graphs (e.g. bounded treewidth, sparse). Using the previous
results, we provide tight algorithms for the practically useful family of

account. In the limit of an infinite spread in the of all interactions, the
S-matrix assumes its standard form. To better understand the significance of
the emerging quantum phenomena in this formalism, we consider a solvable
field-theoretic model with spatial Gaussian spreads at the interaction
vertices. This solvable model, which was previously introduced in the
literature, enables accurate descriptions of detection regions that are either
close to or far from the source. In close analogy with light diffraction in
classical optics, we call these two regions near-field and far-field zones, or
the Fresnel and Fraunhofer regions. We revisit the question whether mixed
mediators produce an oscillating pattern if their detection occurs in the
Fresnel region. Besides corroborating certain earlier findings of the S-matrix
amplitude in the forward Fresnel and Fraunhofer regimes, we observe several
novel features with respect to its angular dependence which have not been
accounted before in the literature. In particular, we obtain a ``quantum
obliquity factor'' that suppresses particle propagation in the backwards
direction, thereby providing an explicit quantum field-theoretic description
for its origin in diffractive optics. Present and future colliders, as well as
both short and long baseline neutrino experiments, would greatly benefit from
the many predictions that can be offered from such a holistic localised

global (or averaged) cosmic properties regarding luminous objects and the
intergalactic medium and the optical depth to electron scattering of ionized
hydrogen to CMB photons: one with a monotonic behavior, which is completed by
$z=6$, as commonly considered, and another one with a non-monotonic behavior
with two full ionization events at $z=6$ and $z=10$. We find that the
Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions of very high-$z$ LAEs are very distinct in
those two scenarios. Thus, comparing these predictions to the observations that
will soon be available thanks to new instruments such as the James Webb Space

the meantime, we can compare the predicted redshift distribution and UV (or
Lyman-$\alpha$) luminosities of very high-$z$ LAEs to those of the few objects
already observed at $z>7.5$. By doing that we find that such data are in

many follow-up studies due to its self-explanatory property for explainable

vision transformer (ViT) backbones, learned prototypes have a ""distraction""
problem: they have a relatively high probability of being activated by the
background and pay less attention to the foreground. The powerful capability of
modeling long-term dependency makes the transformer-based ProtoPNet hard to
focus on prototypical parts, thus severely impairing its inherent
interpretability. This paper proposes prototypical part transformer
(ProtoPFormer) for appropriately and effectively applying the prototype-based
method with ViTs for interpretable image recognition. The proposed method
introduces global and local prototypes for capturing and highlighting the
representative holistic and partial features of targets according to the
architectural characteristics of ViTs. The global prototypes are adopted to
provide the global view of objects to guide local prototypes to concentrate on
the foreground while eliminating the influence of the background. Afterwards,
local prototypes are explicitly supervised to concentrate on their respective
prototypical visual parts, increasing the overall interpretability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed global and local prototypes can
mutually correct each other and jointly make final decisions, which faithfully
and transparently reason the decision-making processes associatively from the
whole and local perspectives, respectively. Moreover, ProtoPFormer consistently
achieves superior performance and visualization results over the

representing conditional independence models. They have many attractive
properties when applied to such models, and they are particularly nice for
working with directed acyclic graph (DAG) models. In particular, the `standard'
imset for a DAG is in one-to-one correspondence with the independences it
induces, and hence is a label for its Markov equivalence class. We first
present a proposed extension to standard imsets for maximal ancestral graph
(MAG) models, using the parameterizing set representation of
\citet{hu2020faster}. We show that for many such graphs our proposed imset is
\emph{perfectly Markovian} with respect to the graph, including \emph{simple}
MAGs, as well as for a large class of purely bidirected models. Thus providing
a scoring criteria by measuring the discrepancy for a list of independences
that define the model; this gives an alternative to the usual BIC score that is
much easier to compute. We also show that, of independence models that do
represent the MAG, the one we give is the simplest possible, in a manner we
make precise. Unfortunately, for some graphs the representation does not
represent all the independences in the model, and in certain cases does not
represent any at all. For these general MAGs, we refine the reduced ordered
local Markov property \citep{richardlocalmarkov} by a novel graphical tool

gesticulation. For each tier we evaluated both the human-likeness of the
gesture motion and its appropriateness for the specific speech signal. Our
evaluations decouple human-likeness from gesture appropriateness, which
previously was a major challenge in the field.
  The evaluation results are a revolution, and a revelation. Some synthetic
conditions are rated as significantly more human-like than human motion
capture. To the best of our knowledge, this has never been shown before on a

2-D domains is a subject of great importance for the numerical solution of

of the potential by quadrature becomes costly. In this paper, we present a
simple and efficient high-order algorithm for computing Newtonian potentials,
based on the use of Green's third identity for transforming the volume integral
into a collection of boundary integrals, which can be easily handled by the
Helsing-Ojala method. As a result, the time cost of the classically expensive
near field and self-interaction computations over an unstructured mesh becomes
roughly the same as the time cost of the FMM-based far field interaction

monomial approximation of a function over a mesh element, which is often
regarded as an ill-conditioned problem, since it involves the solution of a
Vandermonde linear system. In fact, it has long been observed that, when the
function is sufficiently smooth, and when a backward stable linear system
solver is used, the resulting monomial expansion can approximate the function
uniformly to high accuracy. We rigorously formalize this observation in this
paper. The performance of our algorithm is illustrated through several

vulnerable to membership inference attacks in which an adversary aims to infer
whether an input sample was used to train the model. Over the past few years,
researchers have produced many membership inference attacks and defenses.
However, these attacks and defenses employ a variety of strategies and are
conducted in different models and datasets. The lack of comprehensive
benchmark, however, means we do not understand the strengths and weaknesses of
existing attacks and defenses.
  We fill this gap by presenting a large-scale measurement of different
membership inference attacks and defenses. We systematize membership inference
through the study of nine attacks and six defenses and measure the performance
of different attacks and defenses in the holistic evaluation. We then quantify
the impact of the threat model on the results of these attacks. We find that
some assumptions of the threat model, such as same-architecture and
same-distribution between shadow and target models, are unnecessary. We are
also the first to execute attacks on the real-world data collected from the
Internet, instead of laboratory datasets. We further investigate what
determines the performance of membership inference attacks and reveal that the
commonly believed overfitting level is not sufficient for the success of the
attacks. Instead, the Jensen-Shannon distance of entropy/cross-entropy between
member and non-member samples correlates with attack performance much better.
This gives us a new way to accurately predict membership inference risks
without running the attack. Finally, we find that data augmentation degrades
the performance of existing attacks to a larger extent, and we propose an
adaptive attack using augmentation to train shadow and attack models that
improve attack performance.

an important step in this direction by exploring different features that can

from word embeddings, language modelling features, as well as topological
features of the word embedding space. To examine the utility of each feature
set, we train a seed model based on the widely used MultiWOZ data-set. Then, we
apply this model to a different corpus, the Schema-Guided Dialogue data-set.

using a surface-based representation. However, the latter do not scale well

The first module predicts occupancy probability in the entire volume of the

to predict the visibility of the samples. Finally, we integrate the visibility
to evaluate the gain in surface coverage for the new camera pose. NBV is
selected as the pose that maximizes the gain in total surface coverage. Our
method scales to large scenes and handles free camera motion: It takes as input
an arbitrarily large point cloud gathered by a depth sensor as well as camera
poses to predict NBV. We demonstrate our approach on a novel dataset made of

a field, randomly encounter failures, and call for help from the operator. As
the agbots report errors, various audio communication mechanisms are tested to
convey which robot failed and what type of failure occurs. The human is tasked
with verbally diagnosing the failure while completing a secondary task. A user
study was conducted to test three audio communication methods: earcons,
single-phrase commands, and full sentence communication. Each participant
completed a survey to determine their preferences and each method's overall
effectiveness. Our results suggest that the system using single phrases is the
most positively perceived by participants and may allow for the human to
complete the secondary task more efficiently. The code is available at:

confidence in the correctness of a program. In contrast to unbounded
verification, reasoning about calls via (bounded) inlining and about loops via
(bounded) unrolling does not require method specifications and loop invariants
and, therefore, reduces the annotation overhead to the bare minimum, namely
specifications of the properties to be verified. For verifiers based on
traditional program logics, verification is preserved by inlining (and
unrolling): successful unbounded verification of a program w.r.t. some
annotation implies successful verification of the inlined program. That is, any
error detected in the inlined program reveals a true error in the original
program. However, this essential property might not hold for automatic
separation logic verifiers such as Caper, GRASShopper, RefinedC, Steel,
VeriFast, and verifiers based on Viper. In this setting, inlining generally
changes the resources owned by method executions, which may affect automatic
proof search algorithms and introduce spurious errors.
  In this paper, we present the first technique for verification-preserving
inlining in automatic separation logic verifiers. We identify a semantic
condition on programs and prove in Isabelle/HOL that it ensures
verification-preserving inlining for state-of-the-art automatic separation
logic verifiers. We also prove a dual result: successful verification of the
inlined program ensures that there are method and loop annotations that enable
the verification of the original program for bounded executions. To check our
semantic condition automatically, we present two approximations that can be
checked syntactically and with a program verifier, respectively. We implement
these checks in Viper and demonstrate that they are effective for non-trivial
examples from different verifiers.

this problem, assuming access to a flexible sampling mechanism: the generative

fast learning algorithm called \myalg~and an adaptive sampling scheme that
leverage the optimism principle in online adversarial learning (particularly
the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) method). Our algorithm learns an

up a search process for satisfying assignments to variables that could be used

search branch runs into a conflict, the cause of the conflict is analysed and
used to create a new clause that lets a branch fail earlier if the conflict

model assumptions (e.g. a kernel shape) that are not derived from prior

work. We show in this paper that regularization can indeed be achieved by
assuming nothing but invariance principles (w.r.t. scaling, translation, and
rotation of input and output space) and the degree of differentiability of the
true function.
  Concretely, we derive a novel (non-Gaussian) stochastic process from the
above minimal assumptions, and we present a corresponding Bayesian inference
method for regression. The mean posterior turns out to be a polyharmonic
spline, and the posterior process is a mixture of t-processes.
  Compared with Gaussian process regression, the proposed method shows equal
performance and has the advantages of being (i) less arbitrary (no choice of
kernel) (ii) potentially faster (no kernel parameter optimization), and (iii)
having better extrapolation behavior.
  We believe that the proposed theory has central importance for the conceptual
foundations of regularization and machine learning and also has great potential
to enable practical advances in ML areas beyond regression.

On the algebraic side, we elucidate properties that pertain to behavior under
ideal operations, primary decomposition, and the structure of their Rees
algebra. On the combinatorial side, we develop a notion of partition Borel
generators which leads to connections to discrete polymatroids, convex
polytopes, and permutohedral toric varieties.

groups are embedded in an $Spin(4)=SU(2) \otimes SU(2)$ group that are

with symmetries are further invariant under an $SU(2)$ spin group or an
equivalent of it but always break pre-existing higher space-time Lorentz

spontaneously broken only if interactions are strong enough and resultant
strong coupling states become fully gapped. However if states remain gapless,
emergent $U(1)$ symmetries are always present, despite that these states may
exhibit much lower space-time symmetries compared to their weakly interacting

identified all possible gapless real fermions with or without Lorentz

target uncertainties of $\sigma(<z>)<0.002\,(1+z)$ via cross-correlation, with
spectroscopic samples akin to those from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey (BOSS), Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), and Euclid's NISP
spectroscopic survey. We construct mock Euclid and spectroscopic galaxy samples
from the Flagship simulation and measure small-scale clustering redshifts up to
redshift $z<1.8$ with an algorithm that performs well on current galaxy survey
data. The clustering measurements are then fitted to two $n(z)$ models: one is
the true $n(z)$ with a free mean; the other a Gaussian Process modified to be
restricted to non-negative values. We show that $<z>$ is measured in each
tomographic redshift bin to an accuracy of order 0.01 or better. By measuring
the clustering redshifts on subsets of the full Flagship area, we construct
scaling relations that allow us to extrapolate the method performance to larger
sky areas than are currently available in the mock. For the full expected
Euclid, BOSS, and DESI overlap region of approximately 6000 deg$^{2}$, the
uncertainties attainable by clustering redshifts exceeds the Euclid requirement
by at least a factor of three for both $n(z)$ models considered, although
systematic biases limit the accuracy. Clustering redshifts are an extremely
effective method for redshift calibration for Euclid if the sources of
systematic biases can be determined and removed, or calibrated-out with
sufficiently realistic simulations. We outline possible future work, in
particular an extension to higher redshifts with quasar reference samples.

determined under which conditions the Eurybates-Queta system survives. We show
that the collisional strength of the Jupiter Trojans and the age of the
Eurybates family and by extension Queta are correlated.
  The collisional grinding of the Jupiter Trojan population over 4.5 Gy results
in a size-frequency distribution (SFD) that remains largely unaltered at large
sizes (>10 km) but is depleted at small sizes (10 m to 1 km). This results in a
turnover in the SFD, the location of which depends on the collisional strength
of the material. It is to be expected that the Trojan SFD bends between 1 and
10 km.
  Based on the SFD of the Eurybates family, we find that the family was likely
the result of a catastrophic impact onto a 100 km rubble pile target. This
corresponds to objects with a rather low collisional strength (10 times weaker
than that of basaltic material studied in Benz & Asphaug1999).
  Assuming this weak strength, and an initial cumulative slope of the size
frequency distribution of 2.1 between diameters of 2 m and 100 km when the
Trojans were captured, the existence of Queta, the satellite of Eurybates,
implies an upper limit for the family age of 3.7 Gy. Alternatively, we
demonstrate that an unconventional collisional strength with a minimum at 20 m
is a plausible candidate to ensure the survival of Queta over the age of the
Solar System.
  Finally, we show how different collisional histories change the expected
number of craters on the targets of the Lucy mission and that Lucy will be able
to differentiate between them.

controlled quantum platforms has been fueled by the recent discovery of
measurement-induced phases and phase transitions. So far, these transitions
remained largely elusive, since they are masked in standard quantum mechanical
observables due to the randomness of measurement outcomes. Here, we establish a
general scheme -- pre-selection -- to make them observable: The outcome
randomness is broken explicitly by steering the system towards a representative
state, which corresponds to one out of exponentially many possible measurement
outcomes. Remarkably, this steering can be chosen so gently that the basic
properties of the underlying measurement-induced transition, such as
entanglement structure and critical exponents, are not modified. Pre-selection
introduces a unique dark or absorbing state with macroscopic order, replacing
the maximally mixed stationary state of the unconditioned measurement
trajectory ensemble. This creates a link of measurement-induced phase
transitions to new forms of quantum absorbing state transitions, which can be
detected by standard means via a local order parameter. This insight further

change the picture substantially. The Kondo lattice model is a paradigmatic
example of the interplay of electron correlations and conduction electrons of a
metallic system, describing heavy fermion materials and also fractionalized

In this work, we study a superconducting Kondo lattice model, a network of 1D
Kitaev superconductors Kondo coupled to a lattice of magnetic moments. Using
slave-particle representation of spins and exact numerical calculations, we
obtain the phase diagram of the model in terms of Kondo coupling $J_K$ and
identify a topological order phase for $J_{K}<J_{K}^c$ and a Kondo compensated
phase for $J_{K}>J_{K}^c$, where $J_{K}^c$ is the critical point. Setting the
energy scales of electron hopping and pairing to unity, the mean-field theory
calculations achives $J_{K}^c=2$ and in exact numerics we found $J_{K}^c\simeq
1.76$, both of which show that the topological order is a robust phase. We
argue that in terms of slave particles, the compensated phase corresponds to an
invertible phase, and a Mott insulating transition leads to a topological order
phase. Furthermore, we show that in the regime $J_{K}<J_{K}^c$ in addition to

insulator, from which the quasiparticle emerges as a collective mode. The
underlying pseudogap phase at low doping is characterized by a two-component
resonating-valence-bond (RVB) order, which vanishes in the overdoping at
$\delta>\delta^*$. Barring superconducting phase coherence, a Fermi arc
structure is naturally present in such a pseudogap state, while a full Fermi
surface is recovered only in the overdoping without RVB. Nevertheless, upon a
careful examination, we show that the Luttinger volume as enclosed by the
gapless quasiparticle contour is always satisfied in both cases, and the ""Fermi
arc"" at $\delta<\delta^*$ is actually due to a significant reduction of the
spectral weight caused by a quasiparticle fractionalization into more
elementary particles in the antinodal region. In particular, hot spots appear
as the enhanced density of states at the endpoints of the ""Fermi arcs"", which
can further give rise to a charge-density-wave-like quasiparticle interference
pattern. We also find that small Fermi-pockets violating the Luttinger volume
can indeed emerge if the secondary doping-induced RVB order is suppressed
alone, say, by strong perpendicular magnetic fields. At the critical doping
$\delta^*$ beyond which the primary RVB order vanishes, the fractionalized spin
excitations become incoherent which is signaled by a divergent specific heat.
At $\delta>\delta^*$, the quasiparticle excitation maintains the coherence
uniformly over the full (large) Fermi surface, even though the
fractionalization still persists at a higher energy/temperature. Different
mechanisms for the Fermi arc and experimental comparisons are briefly
discussed.

bias that is accurate to subpercent level and far simpler to use. With the
interpretation that smoothed image pixel values and galaxy properties are
projections of the image signal onto a set of basis functions, we analytically
derive the linear shear responses of both the pixel values and the galaxy
properties (i.e., magnitude, size and shape) using the shear responses of the
basis functions. With these derived shear responses, we correct for biases from
shear-dependent galaxy detection and galaxy sample selection. With the
analytical covariance matrix of measurement errors caused by image noise on
pixel values and galaxy properties, we correct for the noise biases in galaxy
shape measurement and the detection/selection process to the second-order in
noise. The code used for this paper can carry out the detection, selection, and
shear measurement for ~1000 galaxies per CPU second. The algorithm is tested
with realistic image simulations, and we find, after the analytical correction
(without relying on external image calibration) for the detection/selection

ram-pressure stripped galaxies in A2744 are strictly located within a

direct result of the merger between two components of the cluster. Finally, we
study the morphologies of the stripped and poststarburst galaxies, using
numerical measures to quantify the level of visual disturbances. We explore any
morphological deviations of these galaxies from the cluster population,
particularly the weaker cases which have been confirmed via the presence of
ionised gas tails to be undergoing ram-pressure stripping, but are not strongly
visually disturbed in the broad-band data. We find that the stripped sample
galaxies are generally divergent from the general cluster sample, with
poststarburst galaxies being intermediary in morphology between stripped

star formation, larger supernova-driven bubbles, and stronger galactic outflows
compared to the Eulerian code. This is caused by the behavior in the dense,
collapsing gas clouds when the Jeans length becomes unresolved: gas in
Lagrangian codes collapses to much higher densities than in Eulerian codes, as
the latter is stabilized by the minimal cell size. Therefore, more of the gas
cloud is converted to stars and SNe are much more clustered in the Lagrangian
models, amplifying their dynamical impact. The differences between Lagrangian
and Eulerian codes can be reduced by adopting a higher star formation
efficiency in Eulerian codes, which significantly enhances SN clustering in the
latter. Adopting a zero SN delay time reduces burstiness in all codes,
resulting in vanishing outflows as SN clustering is suppressed.

the scope of the estimator from differentiable models to non-differentiable

automatically identifies differentiable parts of a given probabilistic program
using our static analysis, and applies the pathwise gradient estimator to the
identified parts while using a more general but less efficient estimator,
called score estimator, for the rest of the program. Our analysis has a
surprisingly subtle soundness argument, partly due to the misbehaviours of some
target smoothness properties when viewed from the perspective of program
analysis designers. For instance, some smoothness properties are not preserved
by function composition, and this makes it difficult to analyse sequential
composition soundly without heavily sacrificing precision. We formulate five
assumptions on a target smoothness property, prove the soundness of our
analysis under those assumptions, and show that our leading examples satisfy
these assumptions. We also show that by using information from our analysis
instantiated for differentiability, our improved gradient estimator satisfies
an important differentiability requirement and thus computes the correct
estimate on average (i.e., returns an unbiased estimate) under a regularity
condition. Our experiments with representative probabilistic programs in the
Pyro language show that our static analysis is capable of identifying smooth
parts of those programs accurately, and making our improved pathwise gradient
estimator exploit all the opportunities for high performance in those programs.

data leakage due to adversarial attacks on the source model. Hence, the
Black-Box setting only allows to use the outputs of source model, but still
suffers from overfitting on the source domain more severely due to source
model's unseen weights. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named RAIN
(RegulArization on Input and Network) for Black-Box domain adaptation from both
input-level and network-level regularization. For the input-level, we design a
new data augmentation technique as Phase MixUp, which highlights task-relevant
objects in the interpolations, thus enhancing input-level regularization and
class consistency for target models. For network-level, we develop a Subnetwork
Distillation mechanism to transfer knowledge from the target subnetwork to the
full target network via knowledge distillation, which thus alleviates
overfitting on the source domain by learning diverse target representations.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several cross-domain benchmarks under both single- and
multi-source black-box domain adaptation.

the theory that lower mass black holes found in lower mass galaxies produce a
hotter accretion disk, which in turn enhances the higher ionization coronal
line spectrum. Future coronal line searches with 30 m class telescopes or JWST
may provide a pathway into uncovering the intermediate mass black hole
population.

environment through random actions, of which a large portion can be
unproductive. Instead, exploration can be improved by initializing the learning
policy with an existing (previously learned or hard-coded) oracle policy,
offline data, or demonstrations. In the case of using an oracle policy, it can
be unclear how best to incorporate the oracle policy's experience into the
learning policy in a way that maximizes learning sample efficiency. In this
paper, we propose a method termed Critic Confidence Guided Exploration (CCGE)
for incorporating such an oracle policy into standard actor-critic
reinforcement learning algorithms. More specifically, CCGE takes in the oracle
policy's actions as suggestions and incorporates this information into the
learning scheme when uncertainty is high, while ignoring it when the
uncertainty is low. CCGE is agnostic to methods of estimating uncertainty, and
we show that it is equally effective with two different techniques.
Empirically, we evaluate the effect of CCGE on various benchmark reinforcement
learning tasks, and show that this idea can lead to improved sample efficiency
and final performance. Furthermore, when evaluated on sparse reward
environments, CCGE is able to perform competitively against adjacent algorithms
that also leverage an oracle policy. Our experiments show that it is possible
to utilize uncertainty as a heuristic to guide exploration using an oracle in
reinforcement learning. We expect that this will inspire more research in this
direction, where various heuristics are used to determine the direction of
guidance provided to learning.

propagated state is efficiently expressed in terms of orthogonal basis states

the number of qubits, by controlling the precision (number of significant

imaginary-time step is estimated to be polynomial in $n$. Additionally, while
in many QAs the locality of the Hamiltonian is a key assumption, in our
algorithm this restriction is not required. This characteristic of our
algorithm renders it useful for studying highly nonlocal systems, such as the

Forecast horizon has a central impact and dominates other factors' impacts.
Therefore, the analysis of solar forecasts should be done separately for each

skill score. Regarding inputs, historical data and spatial temporal information
are highly helpful. For intra-day, sky and satellite images show the most
importance. For day-ahead, numerical weather predictions and locally measured

Ensemble-hybrid models achieve the most accurate forecasts for all horizons.
Hybrid models show superiority for intra-hour while image-based methods are the
most efficient for intra-day forecasts. More training data can enhance skill
score. However, over-fitting is observed when there is too much training data

Recently developed synthetic face image detectors boast ""better-than-human""

whether these human-guided synthetic face detectors can assist non-expert human
operators in the task of synthetic image detection when compared to models
trained without human-guidance. We conducted a large-scale experiment with more
than 1,560 subjects classifying whether an image shows an authentic or
synthetically-generated face, and annotate regions that supported their
decisions. In total, 56,015 annotations across 3,780 unique face images were
collected. All subjects first examined samples without any AI support, followed
by samples given (a) the AI's decision (""synthetic"" or ""authentic""), (b) class
activation maps illustrating where the model deems salient for its decision, or
(c) both the AI's decision and AI's saliency map. Synthetic faces were
generated with six modern Generative Adversarial Networks. Interesting
observations from this experiment include: (1) models trained with
human-guidance offer better support to human examination of face images when
compared to models trained traditionally using cross-entropy loss, (2) binary
decisions presented to humans offers better support than saliency maps, (3)
understanding the AI's accuracy helps humans to increase trust in a given model
and thus increase their overall accuracy. This work demonstrates that although
humans supported by machines achieve better-than-random accuracy of synthetic
face detection, the ways of supplying humans with AI support and of building

reported a decoupled coding for faces in the primate inferotemporal cortex,
with two separate neural populations coding for the geometric position of
(texture-free) facial landmarks and for the image texture at fixed landmark
positions, respectively. Here, we formally assess the efficiency of this
decoupled coding by appealing to the information-theoretic notion of
description length, which quantifies the amount of information that is saved
when encoding novel facial images, with a given precision. We show that despite
decoupled coding describes the facial images in terms of two sets of principal
components (of landmark shape and image texture), it is more efficient (i.e.,
yields more information compression) than the encoding in terms of the image
principal components only, which corresponds to the widely used eigenface
method. The advantage of decoupled coding over eigenface coding increases with
image resolution and is especially prominent when coding variants of training
set images that only differ in facial expressions. Moreover, we demonstrate
that decoupled coding entails better performance in three different tasks: the
representation of facial images, the (daydream) sampling of novel facial
images, and the recognition of facial identities and gender. In summary, our
study provides a first principle perspective on the efficiency and accuracy of
the decoupled coding of facial stimuli reported in the primate inferotemporal

propose a novel memory cross-attention in the decoder, which allows the network

employ a temporal contrastive loss to impose coherence in the representation of
an instance across all frames. Memory attention and temporal coherence are
particularly beneficial to long-range dependency modeling, including
challenging scenarios like occlusion. The proposed InstanceFormer outperforms
previous online benchmark methods by a large margin across multiple datasets.

fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation procedure (CAP). It is not easy to
determine if CAP was successful without a long follow-up assessing for AF
recurrence (AFR). Therefore, an AFR risk prediction algorithm could enable a
better management of CAP patients. In this research, we extracted features from
12-lead ECG recorded before and after CAP and train an AFR risk prediction
machine learning model. Methods: Pre- and post-CAP segments were extracted from
112 patients. The analysis included a signal quality criterion, heart rate
variability and morphological biomarkers engineered from the 12-lead ECG (804
features overall). 43 out of the 112 patients (n) had AFR clinical endpoint
available. These were utilized to assess the feasibility of AFR risk
prediction, using either pre or post CAP features. A random forest classifier
was trained within a nested cross validation framework. Results: 36 features
were found statistically significant for distinguishing between the pre and
post surgery states (n=112). For the classification, an area under the receiver
operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was reported with AUROC_pre=0.64 and
AUROC_post=0.74 (n=43). Discussion and conclusions: This preliminary analysis
showed the feasibility of AFR risk prediction. Such a model could be used to
improve CAP management.

baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). Modeling the galaxy bispectrum at the
tree-level, we find that adding the bispectrum constraints to current CMB
constraints from Planck can improve upon the Planck-only constraints on $N_{\rm

power spectrum (P) constraints previously explored in the literature, using
Planck+P+B provides a further improvement of about 5\% -- 30\%. Besides using
BAO wiggles alone, we also explore using the total information which includes
both the wiggles and the broadband information (which is subject to systematics
challenges), generally yielding better results. Finally, we exploit the
interference feature of the BAOs in the bispectrum to select a subset of
triangles with the most information on $N_{\rm eff}$. This allows for the
reduction of computational cost while keeping most of the information, as well

thermodynamic law is a simple statement concerning the conservation of energy.
Nevertheless, there exist ambiguity and disagreement regarding the precise
partition of a quantum system's energy change to work and heat. By treating
quantum mechanics as a comprehensive theory, applicable to both the micro and
macroscopic domains, and employing dynamical symmetries, we bridge the gaps
between five popular thermodynamic approaches to the first law. These include
both autonomous and semi-classical formulations, which define work in terms of
an ensemble average, as well as the single shot paradigm, where work is defined
as a deterministic quantity.

polymerization parameters of spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes are
the Dirac observables of the four-dimensional Ashtekar's variables. In this
model, black and white hole horizons in general exist and naturally divide the
spacetime into the external and internal regions. In the external region, the
spacetime can be made asymptotically flat by properly choosing the dependence
of the two polymerization parameters on the Ashtekar variables. Then, we find
that the asymptotical behavior of the spacetime is universal, and, to the
leading order, the curvature invariants are independent of the mass parameter
$m$. For example, the Kretschmann scalar approaches zero as $K \simeq
A_0r^{-4}$ asymptotically, where $A_0$ is generally a non-zero constant and
independent of $m$, and $r$ the geometric radius of the two-spheres. In the
internal region, all the physical quantities are finite, and the Schwarzschild
black hole singularity is replaced by a transition surface whose radius is
always finite and non-zero. The quantum gravitational effects are negligible
near the black hole horizon for very massive black holes. However, the behavior
of the spacetime across the transition surface is significantly different from
all loop quantum black holes studied so far. In particular, the location of the
maximum amplitude of the curvature scalars is displaced from the transition
surface and depends on $m$, so does the maximum amplitude. In addition, the
radius of the white hole is much smaller than that of the black hole, and its
exact value sensitively depends on $m$, too.

largely moved beyond evaluation in ""closed-set"" scenarios, to emphasize ability
to generalize to presentation attack types not present in the training data.
This paper offers several contributions to understand and extend the
state-of-the-art in open-set iris PAD. First, it describes the most
authoritative evaluation to date of iris PAD. We have curated the largest
publicly-available image dataset for this problem, drawing from 26 benchmarks
previously released by various groups, and adding 150,000 images being released
with the journal version of this paper, to create a set of 450,000 images
representing authentic iris and seven types of presentation attack instrument
(PAI). We formulate a leave-one-PAI-out evaluation protocol, and show that even
the best algorithms in the closed-set evaluations exhibit catastrophic failures
on multiple attack types in the open-set scenario. This includes algorithms
performing well in the most recent LivDet-Iris 2020 competition, which may come
from the fact that the LivDet-Iris protocol emphasizes sequestered images
rather than unseen attack types. Second, we evaluate the accuracy of five
open-source iris presentation attack algorithms available today, one of which
is newly-proposed in this paper, and build an ensemble method that beats the
winner of the LivDet-Iris 2020 by a substantial margin. This paper demonstrates
that closed-set iris PAD, when all PAIs are known during training, is a solved
problem, with multiple algorithms showing very high accuracy, while open-set
iris PAD, when evaluated correctly, is far from being solved. The newly-created
dataset, new open-source algorithms, and evaluation protocol, made publicly

artifacts that researchers can use to measure progress on this important

essential tool for probing the structure of nuclei as well as astrophysical

typically described within a Faddeev three-body model consisting of a neutron
($n$), a proton ($p$), and the target nucleus ($A$) interacting through
pairwise phenomenological potentials. While Faddeev techniques enable the exact
description of the three-body dynamics, their predictive power is limited in
part by the omission of irreducible neutron-proton-nucleus three-body force
($n$-$p$-$A$ 3BF).
  {\bf Results:} By comparing the Faddeev and NCSM/RGM results, we show that
the irreducible $n$-$p$-$\alpha$ 3BF has a non-negligible effect on bound state
and scattering observables alike. Specifically, the Faddeev approach %are
yields a $^6$Li ground state that is approximately $600$~keV shallower than the
one obtained with the NCSM/RGM. Additionally, the Faddeev calculations for
$d$+$\alpha$ scattering yield a $3^+$ resonance that is located approximately
$400$~keV higher in energy compared to the NCSM/RGM result. The shape of the
$d$+$\alpha$ angular distributions computed using the two approaches also
differ, owing to the discrepancy in the predictions of the $3^+$ resonance
energy.

our system can in real-time adapt its frequency band and achieve bit rates of

4C and 2/3 with both layers receiving direct thalamic inputs and layer 4C
sending vertical projections to layer 2/3. Both the thalamic and the vertical
connections are taken to be modifiable by activity. Using a correlation--based
Hebbian learning rule with subtractive normalization, we show how the formation
of an OD map in layer 4C is inherited by layer 2/3 via the vertical
projections. Competition between these feedforward projections and the direct
thalamic input to layer 2/3 then results in the formation of CO blobs
superimposed upon the ocular dominance map. The spacing of the OD columns is
determined by the spatial profile of the intralaminar connections within layer
4, while the spacing of CO blobs depends both on the width of the OD columns
inherited from layer 4 and the spatial distribution of intralaminar connections
within the superficial layer. The resulting CO blob distribution is shown to be
consistent with experimental data. In addition, we numerically simulate
monocular deprivation and find that while the CO blob distribution is
unaltered, the OD pattern undergoes modification. The OD stripes of the

spectral properties of the mammalian visual cortex -- namely, the $\sim 1/n$
eigenspectrum of the covariance matrix of neural activities -- achieve higher
object recognition performance and robustness to adversarial attacks than those
that do not. To our knowledge, however, no previous work systematically
explored how modifying the ANN's spectral properties affects performance. To
fill this gap, we performed a systematic search over spectral regularizers,
forcing the ANN's eigenspectrum to follow $1/n^\alpha$ power laws with
different exponents $\alpha$. We found that larger powers (around 2--3) lead to
better validation accuracy and more robustness to adversarial attacks on dense
networks. This surprising finding applied to both shallow and deep networks and
it overturns the notion that the brain-like spectrum (corresponding to $\alpha
\sim 1$) always optimizes ANN performance and/or robustness. For convolutional
networks, the best $\alpha$ values depend on the task complexity and evaluation
metric: lower $\alpha$ values optimized validation accuracy and robustness to
adversarial attack for networks performing a simple object recognition task
(categorizing MNIST images of handwritten digits); for a more complex task
(categorizing CIFAR-10 natural images), we found that lower $\alpha$ values
optimized validation accuracy whereas higher $\alpha$ values optimized
adversarial robustness. These results have two main implications. First, they
cast doubt on the notion that brain-like spectral properties ($\alpha \sim 1$)
\emph{always} optimize ANN performance. Second, they demonstrate the potential
for fine-tuned spectral regularizers to optimize a chosen design metric, i.e.,
accuracy and/or robustness.

on the idea of natural evolution. In each of its iterations, a key step entails
ranking candidate solutions based on some fitness score. For an ES method in
Reinforcement Learning (RL), this ranking step requires evaluating multiple
policies. This is presently done via on-policy approaches: each policy's score
is estimated by interacting several times with the environment using that
policy. This leads to a lot of wasteful interactions since, once the ranking is
done, only the data associated with the top-ranked policies is used for
subsequent learning. To improve sample efficiency, we propose a novel
off-policy alternative for ranking, based on a local approximation for the
fitness function. We demonstrate our idea in the context of a state-of-the-art
ES method called the Augmented Random Search (ARS). Simulations in MuJoCo tasks
show that, compared to the original ARS, our off-policy variant has similar
running times for reaching reward thresholds but needs only around 70% as much
data. It also outperforms the recent Trust Region ES. We believe our ideas
should be extendable to other ES methods as well.

distinguished features. In this project, our primary goal is to develop stable

facilitate the statistical inference procedure, we consider the joint modeling
of conditional quantile and expected shortfall. While the regression
coefficients can be estimated jointly by minimizing a class of strictly
consistent joint loss functions, the computation is challenging especially when
the dimension of parameters is large since the loss functions are neither
differentiable nor convex. To reduce the computational effort, we propose a
two-step estimation procedure by first estimating the quantile regression
parameters with standard quantile regression. We show that the two-step
estimator has the same asymptotic properties as the joint estimator, but the
former is numerically more efficient. We further develop a score-type inference
method for hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction. Compared to
the Wald-type method, the score method is robust against heterogeneity and is
superior in finite samples, especially for cases with a large number of
confounding factors. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methods over

it is known that the widely-linear minimum mean-squared-error (WLMMSE)
estimator can achieve a lower mean-squared-error (MSE) than that of the linear
minimum MSE (LMMSE) estimator. Inspired by the WLMMSE estimator, in this paper
we develop the graph signal processing (GSP)-WLMMSE estimator, which minimizes
the MSE among estimators that are represented as a two-channel output of a
graph filter, i.e. widely-linear GSP estimators. We discuss the properties of
the proposed GSP-WLMMSE estimator. In particular, we show that the MSE of the
GSP-WLMMSE estimator is always equal to or lower than the MSE of the GSP-LMMSE
estimator. The GSP-WLMMSE estimator is based on diagonal covariance matrices in
the graph frequency domain, and thus has reduced complexity compared with the
WLMMSE estimator. This property is especially important when using the
sample-mean versions of these estimators that are based on a training dataset.
We then state conditions under which the low-complexity GSP-WLMMSE estimator
coincides with the WLMMSE estimator. In the simulations, we investigate two
synthetic estimation problems (with linear and nonlinear models) and the
problem of state estimation in power systems. For these problems, it is shown
that the GSP-WLMMSE estimator outperforms the GSP-LMMSE estimator and achieves
similar performance to that of the WLMMSE estimator.

crucial to capturing the underlying behavior of agents in social systems. It is
usually challenging to observe these interactions directly, and therefore
modeling the latent interactions is essential for realizing the complex
behaviors. Recent work on Dynamic Neural Relational Inference (DNRI) captures
explicit inter-agent interactions at every step. However, prediction at every
step results in noisy interactions and lacks intrinsic interpretability without
post-hoc inspection. Moreover, it requires access to ground truth annotations
to analyze the predicted interactions, which are hard to obtain. This paper
introduces DIDER, Discovering Interpretable Dynamically Evolving Relations, a
generic end-to-end interaction modeling framework with intrinsic
interpretability. DIDER discovers an interpretable sequence of inter-agent
interactions by disentangling the task of latent interaction prediction into
sub-interaction prediction and duration estimation. By imposing the consistency
of a sub-interaction type over an extended time duration, the proposed
framework achieves intrinsic interpretability without requiring any post-hoc
inspection. We evaluate DIDER on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The
experimental results demonstrate that modeling disentangled and interpretable
dynamic relations improves performance on trajectory forecasting tasks.

accelerator generation and implementation process on an FPGA. It can be used to
build performance and resource usage models that enable fast early-stage design
space exploration. First, training requires large amounts of data (features
extracted from design synthesis and implementation tools), which is
cost-inefficient because of the time-consuming accelerator design and
implementation process. Second, a model trained for a specific environment
cannot predict performance or resource usage for a new, unknown environment. In
a cloud system, renting a platform for data collection to build an ML model can
significantly increase the total-cost-ownership (TCO) of a system. Third,
ML-based models trained using a limited number of samples are prone to
overfitting. To overcome these limitations, we propose LEAPER, a transfer
learning-based approach for prediction of performance and resource usage in
FPGA-based systems. The key idea of LEAPER is to transfer an ML-based
performance and resource usage model trained for a low-end edge environment to
a new, high-end cloud environment to provide fast and accurate predictions for
accelerator implementation. Experimental results show that LEAPER (1) provides,
on average across six workloads and five FPGAs, 85% accuracy when we use our
transferred model for prediction in a cloud environment with 5-shot learning
and (2) reduces design-space exploration time for accelerator implementation on

to be measured and corrected for accurate spectral and spatial calibration. In
this paper, we present a novel method to accurately identify and correct curved
spectral lines in an image of a spectrum, using a clustering algorithm we
developed specifically for grating spectrographs, inspired by K-means
clustering. Our algorithm will be used for calibrating a multi-object
spectrograph (MOS) based on a digital micromirror device (DMD). For each
spectral line in a spectrum image, our algorithm automatically finds the
equation of the parabola which models it. Firstly, the positions of spectral
peaks are identified by fitting Gaussian functions to the spectrum image. The
peaks are then grouped into a given number of parabola-shaped clusters: each
peak is iteratively assigned to the nearest parabola-shaped cluster, such that
the orthogonal distances from the parabola are minimized. Smile can then be
measured from the parabolas, and keystone as well if a marked slit is used. Our
method has been verified on real-world data from a long-slit grating
spectrograph with sub-pixel error, and on simulated data from a DMD-based MOS.
Compared to traditional approaches, our method can measure distortions
automatically and accurately while making use of more spectral lines. With a
precise model and measurement of distortion, a corrected hyperspectral data
cube can be created, which can be applied for real-time data processing.

real-world problems, where constraints often capture the physics of the
underlying system. Classic methods for solving these problems rely on iterative
algorithms that explore the feasible domain in the search for the best
solution. These iterative methods are often the computational bottleneck in
decision-making and adversely impact time-sensitive applications. Recently,
neural approximators have shown promise as a replacement for the iterative
solvers that can output the optimal solution in a single feed-forward providing
rapid solutions to optimization problems. However, enforcing constraints
through neural networks remains an open challenge. This paper develops a neural
approximator that maps the inputs to an optimization problem with hard linear
constraints to a feasible solution that is nearly optimal. Our proposed
approach consists of four main steps: 1) reducing the original problem to
optimization on a set of independent variables, 2) finding a gauge function
that maps the infty-norm unit ball to the feasible set of the reduced problem,
3)learning a neural approximator that maps the optimization's inputs to an
optimal point in the infty-norm unit ball, and 4) find the values of the
dependent variables from the independent variable and recover the solution to
the original problem. We can guarantee hard feasibility through this sequence
of steps. Unlike the current learning-assisted solutions, our method is free of
parameter-tuning and removes iterations altogether. We demonstrate the
performance of our proposed method in quadratic programming in the context of
the optimal power dispatch (critical to the resiliency of our electric grid)
and a constrained non-convex optimization in the context of image registration
problems.

the response of the mean and variance statistics under various initial
conditions and external forcing perturbations. The proposed modeling framework
extends the purely statistical modeling approach that is practically limited to
the homogeneous statistical regime for high-dimensional state variables. The
new closure system allows one to overcome several practical issues that emerge
in the non-homogeneous statistical regimes. First, the proposed ensemble
modeling that couples the mean statistics and stochastic fluctuations naturally
produces positive-definite covariance matrix estimation, which is a challenging
issue that hampers the purely statistical modeling approaches. Second, the
proposed closure model, which embeds a non-Markovian neural-network model for
the unresolved fluxes such that the variance of the dynamics is consistent,
overcomes the inherent instability of the stochastic fluctuation dynamics.
Effectively, the proposed framework extends the classical stochastic parametric
modeling paradigm for the unresolved dynamics to a semi-parametric
parameterization with a residual Long-Short-Term-Memory neural network
architecture. Third, based on empirical information metric, we provide an
efficient and effective training procedure by fitting a loss function that
measures the differences between response statistics. Supporting numerical
examples are provided with the Lorenz-96 model, a system of ODEs that admits
the characteristic of chaotic dynamics with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous
statistical regimes. In the latter case, we will see the effectiveness of the
statistical prediction even though the resolved Fourier modes corresponding to
the leading mean energy and variance spectra do not coincide.

participants used a balance board to control the robot and viewed the virtual
environment through a head-mounted display. The main motivation for using a
balance board as the control device stems from Virtual Reality (VR) sickness;
even small movements of your own body matching the motions seen on the screen
decrease the sensory conflict between vision and vestibular organs, which lies
at the heart of most theories regarding the onset of VR sickness. To test the
hypothesis that the balance board as a control method would be less sickening
than using joysticks, we designed a user study (N=32, 15 women) in which the
participants drove a simulated differential drive robot in a virtual
environment with either a Nintendo Wii Balance Board or joysticks. However, our
pre-registered main hypotheses were not supported; the joystick did not cause
any more VR sickness on the participants than the balance board, and the board
proved to be statistically significantly more difficult to use, both
subjectively and objectively. Analyzing the open-ended questions revealed these
results to be likely connected, meaning that the difficulty of use seemed to
affect sickness; even unlimited training time before the test did not make the
use as easy as the familiar joystick. Thus, making the board easier to use is a
key to enable its potential; we present a few possibilities towards this goal.

is proposed for electromagnetic, electron-driven linear instabilities that have
current layers localised to mode-rational surfaces and binormal wavelengths
comparable to the ion gyroradius. The model retains axisymmetric toroidal
geometry with arbitrary shaping, and consists of orbit-averaged equations for
the mode-rational surface layer, with a ballooning space kinetic matching
condition for passing electrons. The matching condition connects the current
layer to the large scale electromagnetic fluctuations, and is derived in the
limit that $\beta$ is comparable to the square root of the electron-to-ion-mass
ratio. Electromagnetic fluctuations only enter through the matching condition,
allowing for the identification of an effective $\beta$ that includes the
effects of equilibrium flux surface shaping. The scaling predictions made by
the asymptotic theory are tested with comparisons to results from linear
simulations of micro-tearing and electrostatic microinstabilities in MAST

retains feasibility by projecting the resulting points onto the feasible set.
The a.s. convergence of AN-SPS method is proved without the assumptions of

especially weak liveness guarantees.

generate a realistic numerical phantom of myocardial microstructure. We extend
previous studies accounting for the cardiomyocyte shape variability, water
exchange between the cardiomyocytes (intercalated discs), myocardial
microstructure disarray, and four sheetlet orientations. In the first stage of
the method, cardiomyocytes and sheetlets are generated by considering the shape
variability and intercalated discs in cardiomyocyte-to-cardiomyocyte
connections. Sheetlets are then aggregated and oriented in the directions of
interest. Our morphometric study demonstrates no significant difference
($p>0.01$) between the distribution of volume, length, and primary and
secondary axes of the numerical and real (literature) cardiomyocyte data.
Structural correlation analysis validates that the in-silico tissue is in the
same class of disorderliness as the real tissue. Additionally, the absolute
angle differences between the simulated helical angle (HA) and input HA
(reference value) of the cardiomyocytes ($4.3^\circ\pm 3.1^\circ$) demonstrate
a good agreement with the absolute angle difference between the measured HA
using experimental cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) and histology
(reference value) reported by (Holmes et al., 2000) ($3.7^\circ\pm6.4^\circ$)
and (Scollan et al., 1998) ($4.9^\circ\pm 14.6^\circ$). The angular distance
between eigenvectors and sheetlet angles of the input and simulated cDTI is
smaller than those between measured angles using structural tensor imaging
(gold standard) and experimental cDTI. These results confirm that the proposed
method can generate richer numerical phantoms for the myocardium than previous
studies.

polarons: Quasi-particles formed by excess charge carriers coupling with the

key for many applications. Considering that polarons form preferentially on or
near surfaces, we study small polaron formation at the TiO$_2$ termination of

several supercell slabs of Nb-doped and undoped STO(001) surfaces with

to microtubules, which are used as scaffolds for intracellular macromolecular

between amino acid chromophores, is similar to synthetic structures designed
for light harvesting. After photoexcitation, can these amino acid chromophores
transfer excitation energy along the microtubule like a natural or artificial
light-harvesting system? Here, we use tryptophan autofluorescence lifetimes to
probe inter-tryptophan energy hopping in tubulin and microtubules. By studying
how quencher concentration alters tryptophan autofluorescence lifetimes, we
demonstrate that electronic energy can diffuse over 6.6 nm in microtubules. We
discover that while diffusion lengths are influenced by tubulin polymerization
state (free tubulin versus tubulin in the microtubule lattice), they are not
significantly altered by the average number of protofilaments (13 versus 14).
We also demonstrate that the presence of the anesthetics etomidate and
isoflurane reduce exciton diffusion. Energy transport as explained by
conventional F\""orster theory (accommodating for interactions between
tryptophan and tyrosine residues) does not sufficiently explain our
observations. Our studies indicate that microtubules are, unexpectedly,

hacktivists, and civilian participation in the Russia-Ukraine cyber conflict.
Drawing on a range of data sources, we argue that the widely-held narrative of
a cyberwar fought by committed civilians and volunteer 'hacktivists' linked to
cybercrime groups is misleading. We collected 281k web defacement attacks, 1.7M
reflected DDoS attacks, and 441 announcements (with 58k replies) of a volunteer
hacking discussion group for two months before and four months after the
invasion. To enrich our quantitative understanding, we conducted interviews
with website defacers who were active in attacking sites in Russia and Ukraine
during the period. Our findings indicate that the conflict briefly but
significantly caught the attention of the low-level cybercrime community, with
notable shifts in the geographical distribution of both defacement and DDoS
attacks. However, the role of these players in so-called cyberwarfare is minor,
and they do not resemble the 'hacktivists' imagined in popular criminological
accounts. Initial waves of interest led to more defacers participating in
attack campaigns, but rather than targeting critical infrastructure, there were
mass attacks against random websites within '.ru' and '.ua'. We can find no
evidence of high-profile actions of the kind hypothesised by the prevalent
narrative. The much-vaunted role of the 'IT Army of Ukraine' co-ordination
group is mixed; the targets they promoted were seldom defaced although they
were often subjected to DDoS attacks. Our main finding is that there was a
clear loss of interest in carrying out defacements and DDoS attacks after just
a few weeks. Contrary to some expert predictions, the involvement of civilian
and volunteer `hacktivists' in the conflict appears to have been minor and
short-lived; it is unlikely to escalate further.

in reducing the detection complexity of FTN signaling. In particular, we view
the FTN signaling detection problem as a classification task, where the

set of all possible classes samples. If we use an off-shelf classifier, then
the set of all possible classes samples belongs to an $N$-dimensional space,
where $N$ is the transmission block length, which has a huge computational
complexity. We propose a low-complexity classifier (LCC) that exploits the ISI
structure of FTN signaling to perform the classification task in $N_p \ll

pre-classification that constructs the labeled classes samples in the
$N_p$-dimensional space and 2) online classification where the detection of the
received samples occurs. The proposed LCC is extended to produce soft-outputs
as well. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed LCC in

semantics. In this paper, we propose to improve visual representations of
medical images via anatomy-aware contrastive learning (AWCL), which
incorporates anatomy information to augment the positive/negative pair sampling
in a contrastive learning manner. The proposed approach is demonstrated for
automated fetal ultrasound imaging tasks, enabling the positive pairs from the
same or different ultrasound scans that are anatomically similar to be pulled
together and thus improving the representation learning. We empirically
investigate the effect of inclusion of anatomy information with coarse- and
fine-grained granularity, for contrastive learning and find that learning with
fine-grained anatomy information which preserves intra-class difference is more
effective than its counterpart. We also analyze the impact of anatomy ratio on
our AWCL framework and find that using more distinct but anatomically similar
samples to compose positive pairs results in better quality representations.
Experiments on a large-scale fetal ultrasound dataset demonstrate that our
approach is effective for learning representations that transfer well to three
clinical downstream tasks, and achieves superior performance compared to
ImageNet supervised and the current state-of-the-art contrastive learning
methods. In particular, AWCL outperforms ImageNet supervised method by 13.8%
and state-of-the-art contrastive-based method by 7.1% on a cross-domain
segmentation task.

the jet particles. These are the only astrophysical systems where
mildly-relativistic shocks can be directly resolved at various wavelengths of
the electromagnetic spectrum. The western hotspot in the radio galaxy Pictor\,A
is an exceptionally good target in this respect, due to the combination of its
angular size and high surface brightness. In our previous work, after a careful

the two modes are weakly coupled and the rotating-wave approximation (RWA)
applies and the case for which they are strongly coupled and the (RWA) does not
apply. Then, in the regime of validity of (RWA), there is no coherence
generation solely due to squeezing effects, which means there is an exchange of
excitation between the modes and negligible squeezing. On the other hand, if
the two modes are strongly coupled coherence is generated by the squeezing
interaction. For the system of two bosonic modes weakly coupled with a
Markovian bath at temperature $T$ the coherence decreases with $T$. In general,
when both kinds of couplings (exchange of excitation and squeezing) are turned
on the exchange of excitation contributes to generating more coherence in
comparison with a purely squeezing coupling. Thus, the coherence decreases more
slowly with the temperature when both couplings are present. Finally, we
explore the case when only one of the two coupled modes interacts with a
Markovian bath while the other one remains free from the environment. We
observe that the intermode coupling induces oscillations in the coherence and
fidelity dynamics similar to the behavior for the coupling with a non-Markovian

challenging task. While prior methods with model-based representations can
perform reasonably well on whole-body images, they often fail when parts of the
body are occluded or outside the frame. Moreover, these results usually do not
faithfully capture the human silhouettes due to their limited representation
power of deformable models (e.g., representing only the naked body). An
alternative approach is to estimate dense vertices of a predefined template
body in the image space. Such representations are effective in localizing
vertices within an image but cannot handle out-of-frame body parts. In this
work, we learn dense human body estimation that is robust to partial
observations. We explicitly model the visibility of human joints and vertices
in the x, y, and z axes separately. The visibility in x and y axes help
distinguishing out-of-frame cases, and the visibility in depth axis corresponds
to occlusions (either self-occlusions or occlusions by other objects). We
obtain pseudo ground-truths of visibility labels from dense UV correspondences
and train a neural network to predict visibility along with 3D coordinates. We
show that visibility can serve as 1) an additional signal to resolve depth
ordering ambiguities of self-occluded vertices and 2) a regularization term
when fitting a human body model to the predictions. Extensive experiments on
multiple 3D human datasets demonstrate that visibility modeling significantly
improves the accuracy of human body estimation, especially for partial-body
cases. Our project page with code is at: https://github.com/chhankyao/visdb.

the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, transitions between states are
seemingly random. Dwell times, exit distributions, and other transition
statistics can be built into the model through geometric design and can be
controlled by tunable parameters. To test our model's ability to simulate
realistic biological phenomena, we turned to one of the most studied organisms,
{\it C. elegans}, well known for its limited behavioral states. We
reconstructed experimental data from two laboratories, demonstrating the
model's ability to quantitatively reproduce dwell times and transition
statistics under a variety of conditions. Stochastic switching between dominant
states in complex dynamical systems has been extensively studied and is often
modeled as Markov chains. As an alternative, we propose here a new paradigm,
namely chaotic heteroclinic networks generated by deterministic rules (without
the necessity for noise). Chaotic heteroclinic networks can be used to model
systems with arbitrary architecture and size without a commensurate increase in

generally limited by seeing conditions and much worse than space-based
telescopes. This circumstance has generated considerable research interest in
restoration of spatial resolution. Since image deblurring is a typical inverse
problem and often ill-posed, solutions tend to be unstable. To obtain a stable
solution, much research has adopted regularization-based methods for image
deblurring, but the regularization term is not necessarily appropriate for
galaxy images. Although galaxies have an exponential or Sersic profile, the
conventional regularization assumes the image profiles to behave linear in
space. The significant deviation between the assumption and real situation
leads to blurring the images and smoothing out the detailed structures.
Clearly, regularization on logarithmic, i.e. magnitude domain, should provide a
more appropriate assumption, which we explore in this study. We formulate a
problem of deblurring galaxy images by an objective function with a Tikhonov
regularization term on magnitude domain. We introduce an iterative algorithm
minimizing the objective function with a primal-dual splitting method. We
investigate the feasibility of the proposed method using simulation and
observation images. In the simulation, we blur galaxy images with a realistic
point spread function and add both Gaussian and Poisson noises. For the
evaluation with the observed images, we use galaxy images taken by the Subaru

a unified mathematical model that quantitatively describes the transcriptome

element analysis (FEA), the present study examined the failure behaviors of a
powder metallurgy (P/M) Ni-based superalloy and constructed processing maps
with failure domains based on the predicted failure threshold. The
micromechanical Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN) damage model was employed in
the FEA to model the cavity-driven intergranular fracture of the superalloy.
Deformation temperature and strain rate were considered in the range of 1050 ~
1150 C and 0.001 ~ 1 s-1, respectively. The FEA results reveal that the maximum
tensile stress locates at the outer budging surfaces of the samples, which
causes failure initiation and subsequent propagation into longitudinal cracks,
being consistent with the experiments. It is further demonstrated that the
failure is strain-controlled and the critical failure strain remains nearly
insensitive to the range of strain rates considered while increasing with the
increase of temperature in a third-order polynomial. Finally, an optimized
processing window for hot deformation of the superalloy is formulated to
warrant good hot workability while avoiding flow instability and failure. The
present study offers direct insights into the failure behaviors of P/M Ni-based

importance in all these studies is the mapping model, which defines the space
of possible relationships between features and neural data. Until recently,
most encoding and decoding studies have used linear mapping models. Increasing
availability of large datasets and computing resources has recently allowed
some researchers to employ more flexible nonlinear mapping models instead;
however, the question of whether nonlinear mapping models can yield meaningful
scientific insights remains debated. Here, we discuss the choice of a mapping
model in the context of three overarching desiderata: predictive accuracy,
interpretability, and biological plausibility. We show that, contrary to
popular intuition, these desiderata do not map cleanly onto the
linear/nonlinear divide; instead, each desideratum can refer to multiple
research goals, each of which imposes its own constraints on the mapping model.
Moreover, we argue that, instead of categorically treating the mapping models
as linear or nonlinear, we should instead aim to estimate the complexity of
these models. We show that, in many cases, complexity provides a more accurate
reflection of restrictions imposed by various research goals. Finally, we
outline several complexity metrics that can be used to effectively evaluate
mapping models.

mostly in a passive repetitive manner. Here, we propose an electrical and
spectral way of resolving chiral EPs and clarifying the consequences of chiral
mode collapsing of a non-Hermitian gated graphene metasurface. More
specifically, the measured non-Hermitian Jones matrix in parameter space
enables the quantification of nonorthogonality of polarisation eigenstates and
half-integer topological charges associated with a chiral EP. Interestingly,
the output polarisation state can be made orthogonal to the coalesced
polarisation eigenstate of the metasurface, revealing the missing dimension at
the chiral EP. In addition, the maximal nonorthogonality at the chiral EP leads
to a blocking of one of the cross-polarised transmission pathways and,
consequently, the observation of enhanced asymmetric polarisation conversion.
We anticipate that electrically controllable non-Hermitian metasurface
platforms can serve as an interesting framework for the investigation of rich

different existing network alignment algorithms by enforcing alignment
consistency across multiple graph resolutions: nodes matched at finer levels
should also be matched at coarser levels. CAPER also accelerates the use of
slower network alignment methods, at the modest cost of linear-time coarsening

  Modeling","ECCV 2022: L2ID Workshop",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Training deep neural network (DNN) with noisy labels is practically
challenging since inaccurate labels severely degrade the generalization ability
of DNN. Previous efforts tend to handle part or full data in a unified
denoising flow via identifying noisy data with a coarse small-loss criterion to
mitigate the interference from noisy labels, ignoring the fact that the
difficulties of noisy samples are different, thus a rigid and unified data
selection pipeline cannot tackle this problem well. In this paper, we first
propose a coarse-to-fine robust learning method called CREMA, to handle noisy
data in a divide-and-conquer manner. In coarse-level, clean and noisy sets are
firstly separated in terms of credibility in a statistical sense. Since it is
practically impossible to categorize all noisy samples correctly, we further
process them in a fine-grained manner via modeling the credibility of each
sample. Specifically, for the clean set, we deliberately design a memory-based
modulation scheme to dynamically adjust the contribution of each sample in
terms of its historical credibility sequence during training, thus alleviating
the effect from noisy samples incorrectly grouped into the clean set.
Meanwhile, for samples categorized into the noisy set, a selective label update
strategy is proposed to correct noisy labels while mitigating the problem of
correction error. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmarks of
different modalities, including image classification (CIFAR, Clothing1M etc)
and text recognition (IMDB), with either synthetic or natural semantic noises,
demonstrating the superiority and generality of CREMA.

studied. It is shown that the value of the after-diffusion asymmetry is

semimetal allows the other but unexplored spin polarization due to local
symmetry breaking. Here, we report all-electric spin device operation using a
type-II Weyl semimetal, WTe$_2$, at room temperature. The polarization of spins
propagating in the all-electric device is perpendicular to the WTe$_2$ plane,
which is ascribed to local in-plane symmetry breaking in WTe$_2$, yielding the
spin polarization creation of propagating charged carriers, namely, the
spin-polarized state creation from the non-polarized state. Systematic control

comparisons, physical corrections, or e-stops), it has proven useful to model
the human as making noisy-rational choices, with a ""rationality coefficient""
capturing how much noise or entropy we expect to see in the human behavior.
Prior work typically sets the rationality level to a constant value, regardless
of the type, or quality, of human feedback. However, in many settings, giving
one type of feedback (e.g. a demonstration) may be much more difficult than a
different type of feedback (e.g. answering a comparison query). Thus, we expect
to see more or less noise depending on the type of human feedback. In this
work, we advocate that grounding the rationality coefficient in real data for
each feedback type, rather than assuming a default value, has a significant
positive effect on reward learning. We test this in both simulated experiments
and in a user study with real human feedback. We find that overestimating human
rationality can have dire effects on reward learning accuracy and regret. We
also find that fitting the rationality coefficient to human data enables better
reward learning, even when the human deviates significantly from the
noisy-rational choice model due to systematic biases. Further, we find that the
rationality level affects the informativeness of each feedback type:
surprisingly, demonstrations are not always the most informative -- when the
human acts very suboptimally, comparisons actually become more informative,
even when the rationality level is the same for both. Ultimately, our results
emphasize the importance and advantage of paying attention to the assumed
human-rationality level, especially when agents actively learn from multiple
types of human feedback.

day. However, their biometric information (e.g., fingerprint) could be easily

raises a strong desire for anonymizing shared images while maintaining image
qualities, since fingerprints act as a lifelong individual biometric password.
To guard the fingerprint leakage, adversarial attack emerges as a solution by
adding imperceptible perturbations on images. However, existing works are
either weak in black-box transferability or appear unnatural. Motivated by
visual perception hierarchy (i.e., high-level perception exploits model-shared
semantics that transfer well across models while low-level perception extracts
primitive stimulus and will cause high visual sensitivities given suspicious
stimulus), we propose FingerSafe, a hierarchical perceptual protective noise
injection framework to address the mentioned problems. For black-box

to perturb the model-shared high-level semantics (i.e., fingerprint ridges).
Considering visual naturalness, we suppress the low-level local contrast

FingerSafe is the first to provide feasible fingerprint protection in both

  Edge Segmentation of Medical Image",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The convolutional-based methods provide good segmentation performance in the
medical image segmentation task. However, those methods have the following
challenges when dealing with the edges of the medical images: (1) Previous
convolutional-based methods do not focus on the boundary relationship between
foreground and background around the segmentation edge, which leads to the
degradation of segmentation performance when the edge changes complexly. (2)
The inductive bias of the convolutional layer cannot be adapted to complex edge
changes and the aggregation of multiple-segmented areas, resulting in its
performance improvement mostly limited to segmenting the body of segmented
areas instead of the edge. To address these challenges, we propose the CM-MLP
framework on MFI (Multi-scale Feature Interaction) block and ACRE (Axial
Context Relation Encoder) block for accurate segmentation of the edge of
medical image. In the MFI block, we propose the cascade multi-scale MLP
(Cascade MLP) to process all local information from the deeper layers of the
network simultaneously and utilize a cascade multi-scale mechanism to fuse
discrete local information gradually. Then, the ACRE block is used to make the
deep supervision focus on exploring the boundary relationship between
foreground and background to modify the edge of the medical image. The
segmentation accuracy (Dice) of our proposed CM-MLP framework reaches 96.96%,
96.76%, and 82.54% on three benchmark datasets: CVC-ClinicDB dataset,
sub-Kvasir dataset, and our in-house dataset, respectively, which significantly
outperform the state-of-the-art method. The source code and trained models will

the field of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). The raw Electroencephalogram
(EEG) signal is usually represented as 2-Dimensional (2-D) matrix composed of
channels and time points, which ignores the spatial topological information.
Our goal is to make the CNN with the raw EEG signal as input have the ability
to learn EEG spatial topological features, and improve its performance while
essentially maintaining its original structure. Methods:We propose an EEG
Topographic Representation Module (TRM). This module consists of (1) a mapping
block from the raw EEG signal to a 3-D topographic map and (2) a convolution
block from the topographic map to an output of the same size as input.
According to the size of the kernel used in the convolution block, we design 2
types of TRMs, namely TRM-(5,5) and TRM-(3,3). We embed the TRM into 3 widely
used CNNs, and tested them on 2 publicly available datasets (Emergency Braking
During Simulated Driving Dataset (EBDSDD), and High Gamma Dataset (HGD)).
Results: The results show that the classification accuracies of all 3 CNNs are
improved on both datasets after using the TRM. With TRM-(5,5), the average
accuracies of DeepConvNet, EEGNet and ShallowConvNet are improved by 6.54%,
1.72% and 2.07% on EBDSDD, and by 6.05%, 3.02% and 5.14% on HGD, respectively;
with TRM-(3,3), they are improved by 7.76%, 1.71% and 2.17% on EBDSDD, and by
7.61%, 5.06% and 6.28% on HGD, respectively. Significance: We improve the
classification performance of 3 CNNs on 2 datasets by the use of TRM,
indicating that it has the capability to mine the EEG spatial topological
information. In addition, since the output of TRM has the same size as the
input, CNNs with the raw EEG signal as input can use this module without
changing their original structures.

the production of unknown actinides from Ac to Lr via the available stable

$^{232}$Th, $^{238}$U and $^{248}$Cm are investigated thoroughly. Potential
energy surface and total kinetic energy distribution for the reaction system

stage of the scheme solves a sequential rolling optimization problem to
optimally schedule the main resources (such as a mobile diesel generator and
battery storage unit). The second stage adopts a dispatching scheme for the

in terms of low-dimensional effective free energy surfaces parametrized by a
small number of ""slow"" reaction coordinates; the remaining ""fast"" degrees of
freedom populate an equilibrium measure on the reaction coordinate values.
Sampling procedures for such problems are used to estimate effective free
energy differences as well as ensemble averages with respect to the conditional
equilibrium distributions; these latter averages lead to closures for effective
reduced dynamic models. Over the years, enhanced sampling techniques coupled
with molecular simulation have been developed. An intriguing analogy arises
with the field of Machine Learning (ML), where Generative Adversarial Networks
can produce high dimensional samples from low dimensional probability

assesses individual test cases in a randomly-shuffled data stream. It has
demonstrated success in multiple research areas including genetic programming,
genetic algorithms, and more recently symbolic regression and deep learning.
One potential drawback of lexicase selection and its variants is that the
selection procedure requires evaluating training cases in a single data stream,
making it difficult to handle tasks where the evaluation is computationally
heavy or the dataset is large-scale, e.g., deep learning. In this work, we
investigate how the weighted shuffle methods can be employed to improve the
efficiency of lexicase selection. We propose a novel method, fast lexicase
selection, which incorporates lexicase selection and weighted shuffle with
partial evaluation. Experiments on both classic genetic programming and deep
learning tasks indicate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the
number of evaluation steps needed for lexicase selection to select an
individual, improving its efficiency while maintaining the performance.

computational, communication and movement capabilities can autonomously
compress around a food source and disperse when the food is depleted or
shifted, which may occur at arbitrary times. We would like the particles to
iteratively self-organize, using only local interactions, to correctly gather
whenever a food particle remains in a position long enough and search if no
food particle has existed recently. Unlike previous approaches, these search
and gather phases should be self-induced so as to be indefinitely repeatable as
the food evolves, with microscopic changes to the food triggering macroscopic,
system-wide phase transitions. We present a stochastic foraging algorithm based
on a phase change in the fixed magnetization Ising model from statistical
physics: Our algorithm is the first to leverage self-induced phase changes as
an algorithmic tool. A key component of our algorithm is a careful token
passing mechanism ensuring a dispersion broadcast wave will always outpace a

a general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical (GRMHD) framework under
axisymmetry with adaptively refined mesh. Additionally, we have also carried
out radiative transfer calculations for understanding the implications of disc
dynamics on emission. Dynamically, the inner edge of the truncated accretion
disc oscillates in a quasi-periodic fashion (QPO). The QPO frequency of
oscillations $(\nu_{\rm QPO, max})$ increases as the magnetic field strength
and magnetic resistivity increase. However, as the truncation radius increases,
$\nu_{\rm QPO, max}$ decreases. In our simulation models, frequency varies
between $7\times(10M_{\odot}/M_{\rm BH})$ Hz $\lesssim\nu_{\rm QPO,

low-frequency QPOs. We further find evidence of transient shocks in the highly
accreting stage during oscillation. Such a transient shock acts as an extended
hot post-shock corona around the black hole that has an impact on its radiative
properties. The radiative transfer calculations show signatures of these
oscillations in the form of modulation in the edge-brightened structure of the

research for a few decades. Pattern formation, chaos, regime shifts and long
transients are frequently observed in field data but specific factors and
mechanisms responsible for the complex dynamics often remain obscure. An
elementary building block of ecological population dynamics is a prey-predator
system. In spite of its apparent simplicity, it has been demonstrated that a
considerable part of ecological dynamical complexity may originate in this
elementary system. A considerable progress in understanding of the
prey-predator system's potential complexity has been made over the last few
years; however, there are yet many questions remaining. In this paper, we focus
on the effect of intraspecific competition in the predator population. In
mathematical terms, such competition can be described by an additional
quadratic term in the equation for the predator population, hence resulting in
the variant of prey-predator system that is often referred to as Bazykin's
model. We pay a particular attention to the case (often observed in real
population communities) where the inherent prey and predator timescales are
significantly different: the property known as a `slow-fast' dynamics. Using an
array of analytical methods along with numerical simulations, we provide
comprehensive investigation into the spatio-temporal dynamics of this system.
In doing that, we apply a novel approach to quantify the system solution by
calculating its norm in two different metrics such as $C^0$ and $L^2$. We show
that the slow-fast Bazykin's system exhibits a rich spatio-temporal dynamics,
including a variety of long exotic transient regimes that can last for hundreds

solves reach-avoid problems over open (i.e., not bounded a priori) time

equations. The reach-avoid problem in this paper is a probabilistic guarantee:
we approximate from the inner a p-reach-avoid set, i.e., the set of initial
states guaranteeing with probability larger than p that the system eventually
enters a given target set while remaining inside a specified safe set till the
target hit. Our approach begins with the construction of a bounded value
function, whose strict p super-level set is equal to the p-reach-avoid set.
This value function is then reduced to a twice continuously differentiable
solution to a system of equations. The system of equations facilitates the
construction of a semi-definite program using sum-of-squares decomposition for
multivariate polynomials and thus the transformation of nonconvex reach-avoid
problems into a convex optimization problem. The semi-definite program can be
solved efficiently in polynomial time via interior point methods. There are
many existing powerful algorithms and off-the-shelf software packages to solve

answering 241 binary questions across 50 images. This model scores 94.7\% on
the binary VQA-v2 dataset. Humans are able to recognize the generated images
and answer questions on them easily. We conclude that a) deep models struggle
to understand the generated content, and may do better after fine-tuning, and

generalized to novel classes with only a few training images. In this paper, we
propose a Cross-Reference and Local-Global Conditional Networks (CRCNet) for
few-shot segmentation. Unlike previous works that only predict the query
image's mask, our proposed model concurrently makes predictions for both the
support image and the query image. Our network can better find the co-occurrent
objects in the two images with a cross-reference mechanism, thus helping the
few-shot segmentation task. To further improve feature comparison, we develop a
local-global conditional module to capture both global and local relations. We
also develop a mask refinement module to refine the prediction of the
foreground regions recurrently. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012, MS COCO,
and FSS-1000 datasets show that our network achieves new state-of-the-art
performance.

reconstruct the cosmic filaments. The mass of the bulge, defined as the product
of stellar mass and bulge-to-total flux ratio M_bulge=M_star x (B/T), is the
primary parameter of correlation with spin-filament alignments: galaxies with
lower bulge masses tend to have their spins parallel to the closest filament,
while galaxies with higher bulge masses are more perpendicularly aligned.
M_star and B/T separately show correlations, but they do not fully unravel
spin-filament alignments. Other galaxy properties, such as visual morphology,
stellar age, star formation activity, kinematic parameters and local
environment, are secondary tracers. Focusing on S0 galaxies, we find
preferentially perpendicular alignments, with the signal dominated by high-mass
S0 galaxies. Studying bulge and disc spin-filament alignments separately
reveals additional information about the formation pathways of the

the mass of the associated bulge. The observed correlation between the flipping
of spin-filament alignments and the growth of the bulge can be explained by

largely improved reconstructions when tested on unconstrained in-the-wild

signed distance fields (SDF) learning, which enables self-supervised learning
of a PIFu without access to GT mesh. The whole framework consists of a normal

and are thus intrinsically sensitive to magnetic fields. Conventionally the
detectors are shielded from stray magnetic fields using external magnetic
shields. However, in particular for applications with strict limits on the
available space and mass of an instrument, external magnetic shields might not
be enough to obtain the required shielding factors or field homogeneity.
Additionally, these shields are only effective for magnetic fields generated

method based on a superconducting groundplane deposited directly on the

with a structured-graph, where nodes and edges are denoted by objects and their
spatial-semantic similarities, respectively. Specifically, we aim to consider
relationships among objects for effectively contextualizing them. To achieve
this, we first detect objects and then measure their semantic and spatial
distances to construct an object graph, which is then represented by a graph
neural network (GNN) for refining visual CNN features for objects. However,
refining CNN features and detection results of every object are inefficient and
may not be necessary, as that include correct predictions with low
uncertainties. Therefore, we propose to handle uncertain objects by not only
transferring the representation from certain objects (sources) to uncertain
objects (targets) over the directed graph, but also improving CNN features only
on objects regarded as uncertain with their representational outputs from the
GNN. Furthermore, we calculate a training loss by giving larger weights on
uncertain objects, to concentrate on improving uncertain object predictions
while maintaining high performances on certain objects. We refer to our model
as Uncertainty-Aware Graph network for object DETection (UAGDet). We then
experimentally validate ours on the challenging large-scale aerial image
dataset, namely DOTA, that consists of lots of objects with small to large
sizes in an image, on which ours improves the performance of the existing

nanoribbons (t-GNRs) connected to electrodes with various coupling strengths
are theoretically studied in the framework of the tight-binding model and
Green's function approach. Due to quantum constriction induced by the indented
edges, such t-GNRs behave like serially-coupled graphene quantum dots (SGQDs).
These types of SGQDs can be formed by tailoring zigzag GNRs (ZGNRs) or armchair
GNRs (AGNRs). Their bandwidths and gaps can be engineered by varying the size
of the quantum dot and the neck width at indented edges. Effects of defects and
contact junction on electrical conductance, Seebeck coefficient and electron
thermal conductance of t-GNRs are calculated. When a defect occurs in the
interior site of textured ZGNRs (t-ZGNRs), the maximum power factor within the
central gap or near the band edges is found to be insensitive to the defect
scattering. Furthermore, we found that SGQDs formed by t-ZGNRs have
significantly better electrical power outputs than those of textured ANGRs due
to the improved functional shape of the transmission coefficient in t-ZGNRs.
With a proper design of contact the maximum power factor ( figure of merit) of
t-ZGNRs could reach $90\%$ ($95\%$) of the theoretical limit.

computationally expensive to estimate from equilibrium molecular dynamics

molecular simulations in many contexts, thus showing promise to estimate
viscosity too in a relatively inexpensive manner. However, ML methods face
significant challenges like overfitting when the size of the data set is small,
as is the case with viscosity. In this work, we train several ML models to
predict the shear viscosity of a Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid, with particular
emphasis on addressing issues arising from a small data set. Specifically, the
issues related to model selection, performance estimation and uncertainty
quantification were investigated. First, we show that the widely used
performance estimation procedure of using a single unseen data set shows a wide
variability on small data sets. In this context, the common practice of using
Cross validation (CV) to select the hyperparameters (model selection) can be
adapted to estimate the generalization error (performance estimation) as well.
We compare two simple CV procedures for their ability to do both model
selection and performance estimation, and find that k-fold CV based procedure
shows a lower variance of error estimates. We discuss the role of performance
metrics in training and evaluation. Finally, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
and ensemble methods were used to estimate the uncertainty on individual
predictions. The uncertainty estimates from GPR were also used to construct an
applicability domain using which the ML models provided more reliable
predictions on another small data set generated in this work. Overall, the
procedures prescribed in this work, together, lead to robust ML models for
small data sets.

one vital task is to detect a specific brain area called the Subthalamic
Nucleus(STN) and a sub-territory within the STN called the Dorsolateral
Oscillatory Region(DLOR). Accurate detection of the STN borders is crucial for
adequate clinical outcomes. Currently, the detection is based on human experts,
guided by supervised machine learning detection algorithms. Consequently, this
procedure depends on the knowledge and experience of particular experts and on
the amount and quality of the labeled data used for training the machine
learning algorithms. In this paper, to circumvent the dependence and bias
caused by the training data, we present a data-driven unsupervised method for
detecting the STN and the DLOR during DBS surgery. Our method is based on an
agnostic modeling approach for general target detection tasks. Given a set of
measurements, we extract features and propose a variant of the Mahalanobis
distance between these features. We show theoretically that this distance
enhances the differences between measurements with different intrinsic
characteristics. Then, we incorporate the new features and distances into a
manifold learning method, called Diffusion Maps. We show that this method gives
rise to a representation that is consistent with the underlying factors that
govern the measurements. Since the construction of this representation is
carried out without rigid modeling assumptions, it can facilitate a wide range
of detection tasks; here, we propose a specification for the STN and DLOR
detection tasks. We present detection results on 25 sets of measurements
recorded from 16 patients during surgery. Compared to a competing supervised

similar results in the STN detection task and superior results in the DLOR

many soft matter systems spanning from the translocation of proteins to moving
emulsions in microfluidic devices. Here we combine experiments and theory to
investigate the collective transport properties of colloidal particles along a
rotating ring of optical traps. In the co-rotating reference frame, the
particles are driven by a vortex flow of the surrounding fluid. When increasing
the depth of the optical potential, we observe a jamming behavior that
manifests itself in a strong reduction of the current with increasing particle
density. We show that this jamming is caused by hydrodynamic interactions that
enhance the energetic barriers between the optical traps. This leads to a
transition from an over- to an under-critical tilting of the potential in the
corotating frame. Based on analytical considerations, the enhancement effect is
estimated to increase with increasing particle size or decreasing radius of the
ring of traps. Measurements for different ring radii and Stokesian dynamics
simulations for corresponding particle sizes confirm this. The enhancement of
potential barriers in the flow-driven system is contrasted to the reduction of
barriers in a force-driven one. This diverse behavior demonstrates that
hydrodynamic interactions can have a very different impact on the collective
dynamics of many-body systems. Applications to soft matter and biological

Each of the optimization problems invokes constraints that allow to exploit the

gradient constraint in the context of CBFs. In this way, the conservativeness
of the control approach is reduced in those points where the CBF is nonsmooth.
Thereby, nonsmooth CBFs become applicable to time-varying control tasks.
Moreover, we overcome the problem of vanishing gradients for the considered
class of constraints which allows us to consider more complex tasks including
disjunctions compared to approaches based on smooth CBFs. As a well-established

characteristics of the wave and net flows depend on cilia and tissue

that belief-speaking, but not truth-seeking, can be associated with the sharing

encoder-decoder structure, which means it can optimise both the user policy and
natural language generation jointly. GenTUS generates both semantic actions and
natural language utterances, preserving interpretability and enhancing language
variation. In addition, by representing the inputs and outputs as word

generalisability in feature representation. We evaluate GenTUS with automatic

uncover power laws for the maximum force and the critical elongation of the

viscoelastic digitation at the triple debonding line is observed during

many legitimate and important purposes for such data collection, but often the
collected data can reveal sensitive information about individuals.
Privacy-preserving technologies, such as differential privacy (DP), can be
employed to protect the privacy of individuals and, furthermore, provide
mathematically sound guarantees on the maximum privacy risk. However, they can
only support informed privacy decisions, if individuals understand the provided
privacy guarantees. This article proposes a novel approach for communicating
privacy guarantees to support individuals in their privacy decisions when
sharing data. For this, we adopt risk communication formats from the medical
domain in conjunction with a model for privacy guarantees of DP to create
quantitative privacy risk notifications. We conducted a crowd-sourced study
with 343 participants to evaluate how well our notifications conveyed the
privacy risk information and how confident participants were about their own
understanding of the privacy risk. Our findings suggest that these new
notifications can communicate the objective information similarly well to
currently used qualitative notifications, but left individuals less confident
in their understanding. We also discovered that several of our notifications
and the currently used qualitative notification disadvantage individuals with
low numeracy: these individuals appear overconfident compared to their actual
understanding of the associated privacy risks and are, therefore, less likely
to seek the needed additional information before an informed decision. The
promising results allow for multiple directions in future research, for
example, adding visual aids or tailoring privacy risk communication to
characteristics of the individuals.

additional timing layers. Several upgrades are currently investigated and
tested: Firstly, a fast monolithic pixel sensor, the TelePix, to provide
precise track timing and triggering on a region of interest is proposed to
overcome this limitation. The TelePix is a 180 nm HV-CMOS sensor that has been

KIT. In this publication, the performance evaluation is presented: The
difference between two amplifier designs is evaluated. A high hit detection
efficiency of above 99.9 % combined with a time resolution of below 4 ns at
negligible pixel noise rates is determined. Finally, the digital hit output to
provide region of interest triggering is evaluated and shows a short absolute
delay with respect to a traditional trigger scintillator as well as an
excellent time resolution. Secondly, a fast LGAD plane has been proposed to
provide a time resolution of a few 10 ps, which is foreseen to drastically
improve the timing performance of the telescope. Time resolutions of below 70

can only possess two tensor polarization modes, which are known as the $+$ and

these extra polarization modes. As a space-borne GW detector, TianQin will be

annotating massive unlabeled log data. Recently, many semi-supervised methods
have been proposed to reduce annotation costs with the help of parsed
templates. However, these methods consider each keyword independently, which
disregards the correlation between keywords and the contextual relationships
among log sequences. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised log
anomaly detection framework, named LogLG, to explore the semantic connections
among keywords from sequences. Specifically, we design an end-to-end iterative
process, where the keywords of unlabeled logs are first extracted to construct
a log-event graph. Then, we build a subgraph annotator to generate pseudo
labels for unlabeled log sequences. To ameliorate the annotation quality, we
adopt a self-supervised task to pre-train a subgraph annotator. After that, a
detection model is trained with the generated pseudo labels. Conditioned on the
classification results, we re-extract the keywords from the log sequences and
update the log-event graph for the next iteration. Experiments on five
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of LogLG for detecting anomalies on
unlabeled log data and demonstrate that LogLG, as the state-of-the-art weakly
supervised method, achieves significant performance improvements compared to

for autonomous mobile platforms. Especially when conditions worsen, typical
sensor modalities may fail to operate optimally and subsequently provide inapt
input for safe navigation control. In this study, we present an approach for
the navigation of a dynamic indoor environment with a mobile platform with a
single or several sonar sensors using a layered control system. These sensors
can operate in conditions such as rain, fog, dust, or dirt. The different
control layers, such as collision avoidance and corridor following behavior,
are activated based on acoustic flow queues in the fusion of the sonar images.
The novelty of this work is allowing these sensors to be freely positioned on
the mobile platform and providing the framework for designing the optimal
navigational outcome based on a zoning system around the mobile platform.
Presented in this paper is the acoustic flow model used, as well as the design
of the layered controller. Next to validation in simulation, an implementation
is presented and validated in a real office environment using a real mobile
platform with one, two, or three sonar sensors in real time with 2D navigation.
Multiple sensor layouts were validated in both the simulation and real
experiments to demonstrate that the modular approach for the controller and
sensor fusion works optimally. The results of this work show stable and safe
navigation of indoor environments with dynamic objects.

  Multiple Access Approach",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are three generic services in 5G: enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB),
ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), and massive machine-type
communications (mMTC). To guarantee the performance of heterogeneous services,
network slicing is proposed to allocate resources to different services.
Network slicing is typically done in an orthogonal multiple access (OMA)
fashion, which means different services are allocated non-interfering
resources. However, as the number of users grows, OMA-based slicing is not
always optimal, and a non-orthogonal scheme may achieve a better performance.
This work aims to analyse the performances of different slicing schemes in
uplink, and a promising scheme based on rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)
is studied. RSMA can provide a more flexible decoding order and theoretically
has the largest achievable rate region than OMA and non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) without time-sharing. Hence, RSMA has the potential to increase
the rate of users requiring different services. In addition, it is not
necessary to decode the two split streams of one user successively, so RSMA
lets suitable users split messages and designs an appropriate decoding order
depending on the service requirements. This work shows that for network slicing
RSMA can outperform NOMA counterpart, and obtain significant gains over OMA in
some region.

Ensemble, in parallel, is one of the oldest time-proven tricks in machine
learning to improve performance by combining the output of multiple independent
models. However, the benefits of ensemble in the context of LTs will be diluted
since ensemble does not directly lead to stronger sparse subnetworks, but
leverages their predictions for a better decision. In this work, we first
observe that directly averaging the weights of the adjacent learned subnetworks
significantly boosts the performance of LTs. Encouraged by this observation, we
further propose an alternative way to perform an 'ensemble' over the
subnetworks identified by iterative magnitude pruning via a simple
interpolating strategy. We call our method Lottery Pools. In contrast to the
naive ensemble which brings no performance gains to each single subnetwork,
Lottery Pools yields much stronger sparse subnetworks than the original LTs
without requiring any extra training or inference cost. Across various modern
architectures on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, we show that our method achieves
significant performance gains in both, in-distribution and out-of-distribution
scenarios. Impressively, evaluated with VGG-16 and ResNet-18, the produced
sparse subnetworks outperform the original LTs by up to 1.88% on CIFAR-100 and

photometry from Gaia Early Data Release 3, we report a Galactic open cluster
with a bifurcated MS, NGC 2422 ( ~ 90 Myr). We exclude the possibilities that
the bifurcated MS pattern is caused by photometric noise or differential
reddening. We aim to examine if stellar rotation can account for the split MSs.
We use spectra observed with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the
Southern African Large Telescope, and directly measured v sin i, the projected
rotational velocities, for stars populating the bMS and rMS. We find that their
v sin i values are weakly correlated with their loci in the color-magnitude
diagram because of contamination caused by a large fraction of rMS stars with
low projected rotational velocities. Based on the spectral energy distribution
fitting method, we suggest that these slowly rotating stars at the rMS may hide
a binary companion, which breaks the expected v sin i-color correlation. Future
time-domain studies focusing on whether these slowly rotating stars are radial
velocity variables are crucial to test the roles of stellar rotation and
binarity in generating the split MSs.

simultaneously, they usually suffer from deficient semantic interactions and
fail to capture the semantic relation between words and characters. To address
the above issues, we propose a simple yet effective PLM CLOWER, which adopts
the Contrastive Learning Over Word and charactER representations. In
particular, CLOWER implicitly encodes the coarse-grained information (i.e.,
words) into the fine-grained representations (i.e., characters) through
contrastive learning on multi-grained information. CLOWER is of great value in
realistic scenarios since it can be easily incorporated into any existing
fine-grained based PLMs without modifying the production pipelines.Extensive
experiments conducted on a range of downstream tasks demonstrate the superior
performance of CLOWER over several state-of-the-art baselines.

However, it is not clear what this process looks like and where the dust is
condensing in the circumstellar environment. By characterizing the location of
the dust and the molecules in the close environment of an AGB star, we aim to
achieve a better understanding the history of the dust formation process. We
observed the carbon star R Scl with the VLTI-MATISSE instrument in L- and
N-bands. The high angular resolution of the VLTI observations, combined with a
large uv-plane coverage allowed us to use image reconstruction methods. To
constrain the dust and molecules' location, we used two different methods: MIRA
image reconstruction and the 1D code RHAPSODY. We found evidence of C2H2 and
HCN molecules between 1 and 3.4 Rstar which is much closer to the star than the
location of the dust (between 3.8 and 17.0 Rstar). We also estimated a
mass-loss rate of 1.2+-0.4x10-6 Msun per yr. In the meantime, we confirmed the
previously published characteristics of a thin dust shell, composed of
amorphous carbon (amC) and silicon carbide (SiC). However, no clear SiC feature
has been detected in the MATISSE visibilities. This might be caused by
molecular absorption that can affect the shape of the SiC band at 11.3 micron.
The appearance of the molecular shells is in good agreement with predictions
from dynamical atmosphere models. For the first time, we co-located dust and
molecules in the environment of an AGB star. We confirm that the molecules are
located closer to the star than the dust. The MIRA images unveil the presence
of a clumpy environment in the fuzzy emission region beyond 4.0 Rstar.
Furthermore, with the available dynamic range and angular resolution, we did
not detect the presence of a binary companion. Additional observations
combining MATISSE and SAM-VISIR instrument should enable this detection in
future studies.

encode the current session sequence (from the first behavior to the current
query) and compute the ranking score using the high-level representations.
However, there is usually some noise in the current session sequence (useless
behaviors for inferring the search intent) that may affect the quality of the
encoded representations. To help the encoding of the current user behavior
sequence, we propose to use a decoder and the information of future sequences
and a supplemental query. Specifically, we design three generative tasks that
can help the encoder to infer the actual search intent: (1) predicting future
queries, (2) predicting future clicked documents, and (3) predicting a
supplemental query. We jointly learn the ranking task with these generative
tasks using an encoder-decoder structured approach. Extensive experiments on
two public search logs demonstrate that our model outperforms all existing
baselines, and the designed generative tasks can actually help the ranking
task. Besides, additional experiments also show that our approach can be easily
applied to various Transformer-based encoder-decoder models and improve their
performance.

Generally good agreement between theory and experiment was achieved for the

two-phase mixture flows with $N$ components is studied. It is derived from a
more complicated model involving diffusion and exchange terms. Important
features of the model are the assumption of isothermal flow, the use of a phase
field function to distinguish the phases and a mixture equation of state
involving the phase field function as well as an affine relation between
partial densities and partial pressures in the liquid phase. This complicates
the analysis. A complete solution of the Riemann initial value problem is

coexist in human-inhabited environments. However, learning a model of people
dynamics is a time consuming process which requires observation of large amount
of people moving in an environment. Moreover, approaches for mapping dynamics
are unable to transfer the learned models across environments: each model only
able to describe the dynamics of the environment it has been built in. However,
the effect of architectural geometry on people movement can be used to estimate
their dynamics, and recent work has looked into learning maps of dynamics from
geometry. So far however, these methods have evaluated their performance only
on small-size synthetic data, leaving the actual ability of these approaches to
generalize to real conditions unexplored. In this work we propose a novel
approach to learn people dynamics from geometry, where a model is trained and
evaluated on real human trajectories in large-scale environments. We then show
the ability of our method to generalize to unseen environments, which is
unprecedented for maps of dynamics.

in all aspects of materials research. Despite the enormous breadth of
information that can be extracted from these techniques, the challenge of
radiation-induced sample change and damage remains prevalent. This is largely
due to the emergence of modern, high-intensity X-ray source technologies and
growing potential to carry out more complex, longer duration in-situ or
in-operando studies. The tunability of synchrotron beamlines enables the
routine application of photon energy-dependent experiments. This work explores
the structural stability of [Rh(COD)Cl]2, a widely used catalyst and precursor
in the chemical industry, across a range of beamline parameters that target
X-ray energies of 8 keV, 15 keV, 18 keV and 25 keV, on a powder X-ray
diffraction synchrotron beamline at room temperature. Structural changes are
discussed with respect to absorbed X-ray dose at each experimental setting
associated with the respective photon energy. In addition, the X-ray radiation
hardness of the catalyst is discussed, by utilising the diffraction data at the
different energies to determine a dose limit, which is often considered in
protein crystallography and typically overlooked in small molecule
crystallography. This work not only gives fundamental insight into how damage
manifests in this organometallic catalyst, but will encourage careful
consideration of experimental X-ray parameters before conducting diffraction on
similar radiation-sensitive organometallic materials.

generate interesting Floquet phases which have no counterparts in the static
model. Specifically, we consider the Aubry-Andr\'e model which is a
one-dimensional time-independent model with an on-site quasiperiodic potential
$V_0$ and a nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude which is taken to have a
staggered form. We add a uniform hopping amplitude which varies periodically in
time with a frequency $\omega$. Unlike the static Aubry-Andr\'e model which has
a simple phase diagram with only two phases (only extended or only localized
states), we find that the driven model has four possible phases: a phase with
only extended states, a phase with multiple mobility gaps separating different
quasienergy bands, a mixed phase with coexisting extended, multifractal, and
localized states, and a phase with only localized states. The multifractal
states have generalized inverse participation ratios which scale with the
system size with exponents which are different from the values for both
extended and localized states. In addition, we observe intricate re-entrant
transitions between the different kinds of states when $\omega$ and $V_0$ are
varied. In the limit of high frequency and large driving amplitude, we find
that the Floquet quasienergies match the energies of the undriven system, but
the Floquet eigenstates are much more extended. We also study the spreading of
a one-particle wave packet and find that it is always ballistic but the
ballistic velocity varies significantly with the system parameters, sometimes
showing a non-monotonic dependence on $V_0$ which does not occur in the static
model. We conclude that the interplay of quasiperiodic potential and driving
produces a rich phase diagram which does not appear in the static model.

orbiting a young F7V-type star, younger than the Praesepe/Hyades clusters (<
$700$ Myr). This planet stands out because of its unusually long orbital period
for transiting planets with known masses ($P_{\mathrm{orb}}$ =
$225.11781^{+0.00025}_{-0.00022}$ days), and because it has a substantial
eccentricity ($e$ = $0.76^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$). The location of TOI-4562 near the
southern continuous viewing zone of TESS allowed observations throughout 25
sectors, enabling an unambiguous period measurement from TESS alone. Alongside
the four available TESS transits, we performed follow-up photometry using the
South African Astronomical Observatory node of the Las Cumbres Observatory, and
spectroscopy with the CHIRON spectrograph on the 1.5 m SMARTS telescope. We
measure a radius of $1.118_{+0.013}^{-0.014}$ $R_{\mathrm{J}}$ and a mass of
$2.30^{+0.48}_{-0.47}$ $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ for TOI-4562 b. The radius of the
planet is consistent with contraction models describing the early evolution of
the size of giant planets. We detect tentative transit timing variations at the
$\sim$ 20 min level from five transit events, favouring the presence of a
companion that could explain the dynamical history of this system if confirmed
by future follow-up observations. With its current orbital configuration, tidal
timescales are too long for TOI-4562 b to become a hot-Jupiter via high
eccentricity migration, though it is not excluded that interactions with the
possible companion could modify TOI-4562 b eccentricity and trigger
circularization. The characterisation of more such young systems is essential
to set constraints on models describing giant planet evolution.

Josephson harmonics. Our main focus is on the ""minimal model"" with one junction
in the SQUID loop possessing the sinusoidal current-phase relation and the
other one featuring additional second harmonic. The current-voltage
characteristic (CVC) turns out to be asymmetric, $I(-V) \neq -I(V)$. The
asymmetry is due to the presence of the second harmonic and depends on the
magnetic flux through the interferometer loop, vanishing only at special values
of the flux such as integer or half-integer in the units of the flux quantum.
The system thus demonstrates the flux-tunable Josephson diode effect (JDE), the
simplest manifestations of which is the direction dependence of the critical
current. We analyze asymmetry of the overall $I(V)$ shape both in the absence
and in the presence of external ac irradiation. In the voltage-source case of
external signal, the CVC demonstrates the Shapiro spikes. The integer spikes
are asymmetric (manifestation of the JDE) while the half-integer spikes remain
symmetric. In the current-source case, the CVC demonstrates the Shapiro steps.
The JDE manifests itself in asymmetry of the overall CVC shape, including
integer and half-integer steps.

an active region. The fronts were observed to propagate along a coronal loop
bundle rooted in a small area within a sunspot umbra. Previous works have
linked these intensity disturbances to slow magnetoacoustic waves that
propagate from the lower atmosphere to the corona along the magnetic field. The
slow magnetoacoustic waves propagate at the local cusp speed. However, the
measured propagation speeds from the intensity images are usually smaller as
they are subject to projection effects due to the inclination of the magnetic
field with respect to the line-of-sight. Here, we aim to understand the effect
of projection by comparing observed speeds with those from a numerical model.
Using multi-wavelength data we determine the periods present in the
observations at different heights of the solar atmosphere through Fourier
analysis. We calculate the plane-of-sky speeds along one of the loops from the
cross-correlation time lags obtained as a function of distance along the loop.
We perform a 2D ideal MHD simulation of an active region embedded in a
stratified atmosphere. We drive slow waves from the photosphere with a 3
minutes periodicity. Synthetic time-distance maps are generated from the
forward-modelled intensities in coronal wavelengths and the projected
propagation speeds are calculated. The intensity disturbances show a dominant
period between [2-3] minutes at different heights of the atmosphere. The
apparent propagation speeds calculated for coronal channels exhibit an
accelerated pattern with values increasing from 40 to 120 km/s as the distance
along the loop rises. The propagation speeds obtained from the synthetic
time-distance maps also exhibit accelerated profiles within a similar range of
speeds. We conclude that the accelerated propagation in our observations is due
to the projection effect.

computer vision. However, designing the architectures of ViTs is laborious and
heavily relies on expert knowledge. To automate the design process and
incorporate deployment flexibility, one-shot neural architecture search
decouples the supernet training and architecture specialization for diverse
deployment scenarios. To cope with an enormous number of sub-networks in the
supernet, existing methods treat all architectures equally important and
randomly sample some of them in each update step during training. During
architecture search, these methods focus on finding architectures on the Pareto
frontier of performance and resource consumption, which forms a gap between
training and deployment. In this paper, we devise a simple yet effective
method, called FocusFormer, to bridge such a gap. To this end, we propose to
learn an architecture sampler to assign higher sampling probabilities to those
architectures on the Pareto frontier under different resource constraints
during supernet training, making them sufficiently optimized and hence
improving their performance. During specialization, we can directly use the
well-trained architecture sampler to obtain accurate architectures satisfying
the given resource constraint, which significantly improves the search
efficiency. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet show that our
FocusFormer is able to improve the performance of the searched architectures

the 1D kinetic electron code SOL-KiT, where the electrons are treated

estimated locations from CBCS are fed to a Gaussian mixture probability

networks (DCRNs) refers to how users in the network can hop to the same channel
at the same time slot without any prior knowledge (i.e., each user is unaware
of other users' information). The channel hopping (CH) technique is a typical
solution to this blind rendezvous problem. In this paper, we propose a quinary
coding and matrix structure-based CH algorithm called QCMS-CH. The QCMS-CH
algorithm can guarantee the rendezvous of users using only one cognitive radio
in the scenario of the asynchronous clock (i.e., arbitrary time drift between
the users), heterogeneous channels (i.e., the available channel sets of users
are distinct), and symmetric role (i.e., all users play a same role). The
QCMS-CH algorithm first represents a randomly selected channel (denoted by R)
as a fixed-length quaternary number. Then it encodes the quaternary number into
a quinary bootstrapping sequence according to a carefully designed
quaternary-quinary coding table with the prefix ""R00"". Finally, it builds a CH
matrix column by column according to the bootstrapping sequence and six
different types of elaborately generated subsequences. The user can access the
CH matrix row by row and accordingly perform its channel hopping to attempt to
rendezvous with other users. We prove the correctness of QCMS-CH and derive an
upper bound on its Maximum Time-to-Rendezvous (MTTR). Simulation results show
that the QCMS-CH algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of the
MTTR and the Expected Time-to-Rendezvous (ETTR).

ever-growing number of partners, while remarkably lengthening the supply chain.
Thereby, security concerns, such as those imposed by functional Reverse
Engineering (RE), have become quintessential. RE leads to disclosure of
confidential information to competitors, potentially enabling the theft of
intellectual property. Traditional functional RE methods analyze a given
gate-level netlist through employing pattern matching towards reconstructing
the underlying basic blocks, and hence, reverse engineer the circuit's
function.
  In this work, we are the first to demonstrate that applying Approximate
Computing (AxC) principles to circuits significantly improves the resiliency
against RE. This is attributed to the increased complexity in the underlying
pattern-matching process. The resiliency remains effective even for Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) that are presently one of the most powerful
state-of-the-art techniques in functional RE. Using AxC, we demonstrate a
substantial reduction in GNN average classification accuracy-- from 98% to a
mere 53%. To surmount the challenges introduced by AxC in RE, we propose the
highly promising AppGNN platform, which enables GNNs (still being trained on
exact circuits) to: (i) perform accurate classifications, and (ii) reverse
engineer the circuit functionality, notwithstanding the applied approximation
technique. AppGNN accomplishes this by implementing a novel graph-based node
sampling approach that mimics generic approximation methodologies, requiring
zero knowledge of the targeted approximation type.
  We perform an extensive evaluation and show that, using our method, we can
improve the classification accuracy from 53% to 81% when classifying
approximate adder circuits that have been generated using evolutionary

introduction of a second species, a linker that mediates the bonds between the

linear chains while still promoting the aggregation of particles is considered
in this work. The particles are patchy particles with $f_C$ patches of type $C$
and the linkers are patchy particles with $2$ patches of type $A$ and $f_B$
patches of type B. The bonds between patches of type $A$ ($AA$ bonds) promote
the formation of linear chains of linkers. Two different ways (model A and
model B) of bonding the linkers to the particles - or inducing branching - are
studied. In model A, there is a competition between chaining and branching,
since the bonding between linkers and particles is done through $AC$ bonds
only. In model B linkers aggregate to particles through bonds $BC$ only, making
chaining and branching independent. The percolation behaviour of these two
models is studied in detail, employing a generalized Flory-Stockmayer theory
and Monte Carlo simulations. The self-assembly of linkers into chains reduces
the fraction of particles needed for percolation to occur (models A and B) and
induces percolation when the fraction of particles is high (model B).
Percolation by heating and percolation loops in temperature composition
diagrams are obtained when the formation of chains is energetically favourable,
by increasing the entropic gain of branching (model A). Chaining and branching
are found to follow a model dependent relation at percolation, which shows
that, for the same composition, longer chains require less branching for
percolation to occur.

by obtaining spatially resolved measurements of the gas and stellar kinematics.
We obtain near-infrared integral field K-band spectroscopy with VLT/SINFONI of
15 compact starburst galaxies. We derive the integrated as well as spatially
resolved stellar and gas kinematics. The stellar kinematics are derived from
the CO absorption bands, and Pa$\alpha$ and Br$\gamma$ emission lines are used
for the gas kinematics. Based on the integrated spectra we find that the
majority of galaxies have gas and stellar velocity dispersion that are
comparable. A spatially resolved comparison shows that the six galaxies that
deviate show evidence for a bulge or stellar feedback. Two galaxies are
identified as mergers based on their double peaked emission lines. In our
sample, we find a negative correlation between the ratio of the rotational
velocity over the velocity dispersion (vrot/$\sigma$) and the star formation
rate surface density. We propose a scenario where the global kinematics of the
galaxies are determined by gravitational instabilities that affect both the
stars and gas. This process could be driven by mergers or accretion events.
Effects of stellar feedback on the ionised gas are more localised and detected
only in the spatially resolved analysis. The mass derived from the velocity
dispersion provides a reliable mass even if the galaxy cannot be spatially
resolved. The technique used in this paper is applicable to galaxies at low and
high redshift with the next generation of infrared focussed telescopes (JWST,

prediction. It is known that an adversarial example designed for one model can
transfer to other models as well. This poses a major threat because it means
that attackers can target systems in a blackbox manner.
  In the domain of transferability, researchers have proposed ways to make
attacks more transferable and to make models more robust to transferred
examples. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no works which
propose a means for ranking the transferability of an adversarial example in
the perspective of a blackbox attacker. This is an important task because an
attacker is likely to use only a select set of examples, and therefore will
want to select the samples which are most likely to transfer.
  In this paper we suggest a method for ranking the transferability of
adversarial examples without access to the victim's model. To accomplish this,
we define and estimate the expected transferability of a sample given limited
information about the victim. We also explore practical scenarios: where the
adversary can select the best sample to attack and where the adversary must use
a specific sample but can choose different perturbations. Through our
experiments, we found that our ranking method can increase an attacker's
success rate by up to 80% compared to the baseline (random selection without

Lagrangian of the interaction between the gravitational degrees of freedom --

built from the difference in connections of the two metrics. I show that the
scope of BIMOND is much richer: The two metrics can couple through several
scalars to give theories that all have a ""good"" nonrelativistic (NR) limit --
one that accounts correctly, a-la MOND, for the dynamics of galactic systems,
{\it including gravitational lensing}. This extended-BIMOND framework exhibits
a qualitative departure from the way we think of MOND at present, as
encapsulated, in all its aspects, by one ""interpolating function"" of one
acceleration variable. After deriving the general field equations, I pinpoint
the subclass of theories that satisfy the pivotal requirement of a good NR
limit. These involve three independent, quadratic scalar variables. In the NR
limit these scalars all reduce to the same acceleration scalar, and the NR
theory then does hinge on one function of a {\it a single} acceleration
variable -- representing the NR MOND ""interpolating function"", whose form is
largely dictated by the observed NR galactic dynamics. However, these scalars
behave differently, in different relativistic contexts. So, the full richness
of the multi-variable Lagrangian, as it enters cosmology, for example, is
hardly informed by what we learn from observations of galactic dynamics. In
this paper, I present the formalism, with some generic examples. I also
consider some cosmological solutions where the two metrics are small departures
from one Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric. This may offer a framework
for describing cosmology within the extended BIMOND.

that the majority of their red supergiant (RSG) progenitors are enshrouded by
large amounts of circumstellar material (CSM) at the point of explosion. The
inferred density of this CSM is orders of magnitude above that seen around RSGs
in the field, and is therefore indicative of a short phase of elevated
mass-loss prior to explosion. It is not known over what timescale this material
gets there: is it formed over several decades by a `superwind' with mass-loss
rate $\dot{M} \sim10^{-3}\,{\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$; or is it formed in less
than a year by a brief `outburst' with $\dot{M}\sim10^{-1}\,{\rm
M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$? In this paper, we simulate spectra for RSGs undergoing such
mass-loss events, and demonstrate that in either scenario the CSM suppresses
the optical flux by over a factor of 100, and that of the near-IR by a factor
of 10. We argue that the `superwind' model can be excluded as it causes the
progenitor to be heavily obscured for decades before explosion, and is strongly
at odds with observations of II-P progenitors taken within 10 years of
core-collapse. Instead, our results favour abrupt outbursts $<$1 year before
explosion as the explanation for the early optical radiation of II-P SNe. We
therefore predict that RSGs will undergo dramatic photometric variability in
the optical and infrared in the weeks-to-months before core-collapse.

models using possibly private data available at edge devices. The distributed
operation of FL gives rise to challenges that are not encountered in
centralized machine learning, including the need to preserve the privacy of the
local datasets, and the communication load due to the repeated exchange of
updated models. These challenges are often tackled individually via techniques
that induce some distortion on the updated models, e.g., local differential
privacy (LDP) mechanisms and lossy compression. In this work we propose a
method coined joint privacy enhancement and quantization (JoPEQ), which jointly
implements lossy compression and privacy enhancement in FL settings. In
particular, JoPEQ utilizes vector quantization based on random lattice, a
universal compression technique whose byproduct distortion is statistically
equivalent to additive noise. This distortion is leveraged to enhance privacy
by augmenting the model updates with dedicated multivariate privacy preserving
noise. We show that JoPEQ simultaneously quantizes data according to a required
bit-rate while holding a desired privacy level, without notably affecting the
utility of the learned model. This is shown via analytical LDP guarantees,
distortion and convergence bounds derivation, and numerical studies. Finally,
we empirically assert that JoPEQ demolishes common attacks known to exploit
privacy leakage.

extremely successful in helping us to understand neural decision making
processes. However, RL's role in understanding other neural processes
especially motor learning is much less well explored. To explore this
connection, we investigated how recent deep RL methods correspond to the
dominant motor learning framework in neuroscience, error-based learning.
Error-based learning can be probed using a mirror reversal adaptation paradigm,
where it produces distinctive qualitative predictions that are observed in
humans. We therefore tested three major families of modern deep RL algorithm on
a mirror reversal perturbation. Surprisingly, all of the algorithms failed to
mimic human behaviour and indeed displayed qualitatively different behaviour
from that predicted by error-based learning. To fill this gap, we introduce a
novel deep RL algorithm: model-based deterministic policy gradients (MB-DPG).
MB-DPG draws inspiration from error-based learning by explicitly relying on the
observed outcome of actions. We show MB-DPG captures (human) error-based
learning under mirror-reversal and rotational perturbation. Next, we
demonstrate error-based learning in the form of MB-DPG learns faster than
canonical model-free algorithms on complex arm-based reaching tasks, while
being more robust to (forward) model misspecification than model-based RL.
These findings highlight the gap between current deep RL methods and human
motor adaptation and offer a route to closing this gap, facilitating future
beneficial interaction between between the two fields.

Finally, to highlight the real-world impact, we conduct two unique case

sheets of this metallic compound in its paramagnetic phase for both density
functional theory (DFT) and the combination of DFT with dynamical mean field
theory (DFT+DMFT). The theoretical spectral functions evaluated at the Fermi
level were used along with calculations of the electron-positron momentum
density (also known as the two-photon momenutm density) in $k$-space to provide
insights into the origin of certain features of the Fermi surface topology. We
compare this two photon momentum density to that extracted from the positron
annihilation experimental data (Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 107003 (2004)). The
DFT+DMFT densities are in better agreement with the experiment than the DFT,
particularly with regard to the flat bands around the $L$ and $W$ high symmetry
points. The experimental neck around $L$, which relates to a van Hove
singularity, is present in DFT+DMFT but not in the DFT. We find that these flat
bands, and as such the Fermi surface topology, are sensitive to the many body
electron correlation description, and show that the positron annihilation
technique is able to probe this. This description is significant for the
observed behavior such as the Lifshiftz transition around the quantum critical

$\rho(x)=a^+(x)a^-(x)$ ($x\in X$), where the operator-valued distributions
$a^+(x)$, $a^-(x)$ come from a gauge-invariant quasi-free representation of the
canonical anticommutation relations (CAR). If the space $X$ is discrete and

Here $P_i$ is the orthogonal projection of $L^2(X,\sigma)$ onto

transformation acts identically on the $X_1$ part of the space and exchanges
the creation operators $a^+(x)$ and the annihilation operators $a^-(x)$ for

a troublesome and challenging issue for common users to design the smoke effect
without domain knowledge of fluid simulations. In this work, we propose
DualSmoke, two stage global-to-local generation framework for the interactive
smoke illustration design. For the global stage, the proposed approach utilizes
fluid patterns to generate Lagrangian coherent structure from the user's
hand-drawn sketches. For the local stage, the detailed flow patterns are
obtained from the generated coherent structure. Finally, we apply the guiding
force field to the smoke simulator to design the desired smoke illustration. To
construct the training dataset, DualSmoke generates flow patterns using the
finite-time Lyapunov exponents of the velocity fields. The synthetic sketch
data is generated from the flow patterns by skeleton extraction. From our user
study, it is verified that the proposed design interface can provide various
smoke illustration designs with good user usability. Our code is available at:

science applications, e.g. preconditioners for iterative boundary integral

hierarchical low-rank matrix formats that can reduce the complexity of
factorizing such dense matrices from $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N)$.
For HSS matrices, it is possible to remove the dependency on the trailing
matrices during Cholesky/LU factorization, which results in a highly parallel
algorithm. However, the weak admissibility of HSS causes the rank of
off-diagonal blocks to grow for 3-D problems, and the method is no longer
$\mathcal{O}(N)$. On the other hand, the strong admissibility of
$\mathcal{H}^2$-matrices allows it to handle 3-D problems in $\mathcal{O}(N)$,
but introduces a dependency on the trailing matrices. In the present work, we
pre-compute the fill-ins and integrate them into the shared basis, which allows
us to remove the dependency on trailing-matrices even for

the given audio. This is made possible with several newly devised components:
1) A contrastive lip-sync discriminator for accurate lip synchronization, 2) A
conditional sequential variational autoencoder that learns the latent motion
space disentangled from the lip movements, such that we can independently
manipulate the motions and lip movements while preserving the identity. 3) An
auto-regressive prior augmented with normalizing flow to learn a complex
audio-to-motion multi-modal latent space. Equipped with these components,
StyleTalker can generate talking head videos not only in a motion-controllable
way when another motion source video is given but also in a completely

mechanics underwent a great development during the last century. In this
scenario the pressence of symmetries in Hamiltonian systems leads naturally to
the existence of conserved quantities. This integrals of motions are described
by the well-known momentum mapping. Furthermore, the equations of motion can be
simplified by a process known as reduction, if the system is invariant under
the action of a certain group. This process can also be considered in the
framework of contact geometry, a much more recent field of study. This kind of
geometry has proven to be valuable in areas as different as thermodynamics,
control theory, or neurogeometry. Our knowledge about contact geometry is much
smaller than that of symplectic, and so a process known as symplectificacion is
extremely useful, since it allows to study contact problems in the symplectic
frame.
  The aim of the text is to study the commutativity relations between the
processes of reduction and symplectification. To do so, we first introduce the
basis of symplectic and contact geometry and we show how to perform the
reduction via the momentum map in both scenarios. The well-known coisotropic
reduction theorem will be crucial in the description. Finally, the

paper, a runner's performance in a race, such as a marathon, is formulated as
an optimal control problem where the controls are: the nutrition intake
throughout the race and the propulsion force of the runner. As nutrition is an
integral part of successfully running long distance races, it needs to be
included in models of running strategies. We formulate a system of ordinary
differential equations to represent the velocity, fat energy, glycogen energy,
and nutrition for a runner competing in a long-distance race. The energy
compartments represent the energy sources available in the runner's body. We
allocate the energy source from which the runner draws, based on how fast the
runner is moving. The food consumed during the race is a source term for the
nutrition differential equation. With our model, we are investigating
strategies to manage the nutrition and propulsion force in order to minimize
the running time in a fixed distance race. This requires the solution of a
nontrivial singular control problem. Our results confirm the belief that the
most effective way to run a race is to run approximately the same pace the
entire race without letting one's energies hit zero.

tackle DG-FSC. Our first contribution is to propose Born-Again Network (BAN)

As a specific form of knowledge distillation, BAN has been shown to achieve
improved generalization in conventional supervised classification with a

  We consider two cases of cells sequentially migrating through a flexible
channel: leader and follower cells being closely adjacent or distant. Using
Wilcoxon's signed-rank test on the data collected from Monte Carlo simulations,
we conclude that the modelled transmigration speed for the follower cell is
significantly larger than for the leader cell when cells are distant, i.e.
follower cells transmigrate after the leader has completed the crossing.
Furthermore, it appears that there exists an optimum with respect to the width
of the channel such that cell moves fastest. On the other hand, in the case of
closely adjacent cells, effectively performing collective migration, the leader
cell moves $12\%$ faster since the follower cell pushes it. This work shows
that mechanical interactions between cells can increase the net transmigration
speed of cancer cells, resulting in increased invasiveness. In other words,
interaction between cancer cells can accelerate metastatic invasion.

intuitive explanations. However, as the tree size grows the model
interpretability deteriorates. Traditional tree-induction algorithms, such as
C4.5 and CART, rely on impurity-reduction functions that promote the
discriminative power of each split. Thus, although these traditional methods
are accurate in practice, there has been no theoretical guarantee that they
will produce small trees. In this paper, we justify the use of a general family
of impurity functions, including the popular functions of entropy and
Gini-index, in scenarios where small trees are desirable, by showing that a
simple enhancement can equip them with complexity guarantees. We consider a
general setting, where objects to be classified are drawn from an arbitrary
probability distribution, classification can be binary or multi-class, and
splitting tests are associated with non-uniform costs. As a measure of tree
complexity, we adopt the expected cost to classify an object drawn from the
input distribution, which, in the uniform-cost case, is the expected number of
tests. We propose a tree-induction algorithm that gives a logarithmic
approximation guarantee on the tree complexity. This approximation factor is
tight up to a constant factor under mild assumptions. The algorithm recursively
selects a test that maximizes a greedy criterion defined as a weighted sum of
three components. The first two components encourage the selection of tests
that improve the balance and the cost-efficiency of the tree, respectively,
while the third impurity-reduction component encourages the selection of more
discriminative tests. As shown in our empirical evaluation, compared to the
original heuristics, the enhanced algorithms strike an excellent balance

introduce a workflow that can efficiently and accurately navigate this

Density functional theory calculations were then performed on these structures
to identify local oxygen environments, which were compared against experimental

redshift, a possible selection effect exists when we consider intrinsically
faint sources which cannot be observed at high redshift. Thus, it is important
to explore the possible relationships between GRB and SN parameters after these
have been corrected for astrophysical biases due to the instrumental selection
effects and redshift evolution of the variables involved. So far, only GRB
prompt emission properties have been checked against the SNe Ib/c properties
without considering the afterglow (AG). This work investigates the existence of
relationships among GRB's prompt and AG and associated SN properties. We
investigate 91 bidimensional correlations among the SN and GRB observables

GRB optical plateau emission and the rest-frame peak time of the SN. According

systems solver that runs in time almost-linear in the number of non-zero
entries of L. Previous reductions imply the first deterministic almost-linear
time algorithms for computing various fundamental quantities on directed graphs
including stationary distributions, personalized PageRank, hitting times and
escape probabilities.
  We obtain these results by introducing partial symmetrization, a new
technique that makes the Laplacian of an Eulerian directed graph ``less
directed'' in a useful sense, which may be of independent interest. The
usefulness of this technique comes from two key observations: Firstly, the
partially symmetrized Laplacian preconditions the original Eulerian Laplacian
well in Richardson iteration, enabling us to construct a solver for the
original matrix from a solver for the partially symmetrized one. Secondly, the
undirected structure in the partially symmetrized Laplacian makes it possible
to sparsify the matrix very crudely, i.e. with large spectral error, and still
show that Richardson iterations convergence when using the sparsified matrix as
a preconditioner. This allows us to develop deterministic sparsification tools
for the partially symmetrized Laplacian.
  Together with previous reductions from directed Laplacians to Eulerian
Laplacians, our technique results in the first deterministic almost-linear time
algorithm for solving linear equations in directed Laplacians. To emphasize the
generality of our new technique, we show that two prominent existing
(randomized) frameworks for solving linear equations in Eulerian Laplacians can
be derandomized in this way: the squaring-based framework of Cohen, Kelner,

Rights of Deep Neural Networks and track their use. Several methods have been
proposed to embed the watermark into the trainable parameters of the network

network in correspondence to specific inputs (black box watermarking). In both
cases, achieving robustness against fine tuning, model compression and, even
more, transfer learning, is one of the most difficult challenges researchers
are facing with. In this paper, we propose a new white-box, multi-bit
watermarking algorithm with strong robustness properties, including robustness
against retraining for transfer learning. Robustness is achieved thanks to a
new embedding strategy according to which the watermark message is spread
across a number of fixed weights, whose position depends on a secret key. The
weights hosting the watermark are set prior to training, and are left unchanged
throughout the training procedure. The distribution of the weights carrying the
watermark is theoretically optimised to make sure that they are
indistinguishable from the non-watermarked weights, while at the same time
setting their amplitude to as large as possible values to improve robustness
against retraining. We carried out several experiments demonstrating the
capability of the proposed scheme to provide high payloads with no significant
impact on network accuracy, at the same time ensuring excellent robustness

the rapid development of 3D object detection and 2D MOT. Recent advanced works
generally employ a series of object attributes, e.g., position, size, velocity,
and appearance, to provide the clues for the association in 3D MOT. However,
these cues may not be reliable due to some visual noise, such as occlusion and
blur, leading to tracking performance bottleneck. To reveal the dilemma, we
conduct extensive empirical analysis to expose the key bottleneck of each clue
and how they correlate with each other. The analysis results motivate us to
efficiently absorb the merits among all cues, and adaptively produce an optimal
tacking manner. Specifically, we present Location and Velocity Quality
Learning, which efficiently guides the network to estimate the quality of
predicted object attributes. Based on these quality estimations, we propose a
quality-aware object association (QOA) strategy to leverage the quality score
as an important reference factor for achieving robust association. Despite its
simplicity, extensive experiments indicate that the proposed strategy
significantly boosts tracking performance by 2.2% AMOTA and our method
outperforms all existing state-of-the-art works on nuScenes by a large margin.
Moreover, QTrack achieves 48.0% and 51.1% AMOTA tracking performance on the

ossible to insert nanosatellites into different hyperbolic orbits with respect

of AGN candidates in a Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy sample, since the
identification and classification of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the
optical band still remains a challenging task in extragalactic astronomy.
Intended for the initial exploration of large sky surveys, ULISSE directly uses
features extracted from the ImageNet dataset to perform a similarity search.
The method is capable of rapidly identifying a list of candidates, starting
from only a single image of a given prototype, without the need for any
time-consuming neural network training. Our experiments show ULISSE is able to
identify AGN candidates based on a combination of host galaxy morphology, color

however, MP has also been reported to repress cambial cell divisions later in

The method quantifies both the strength of the interactions and its

has been shown to be promising for providing early detection, faster diagnosis,
better decision-making, and more effective treatment. However, accessing such
highly confidential and very sensitive medical data, obtained from a variety of
sources, is usually highly restricted since improper use, unsafe storage, data
leakage or abuse could violate a person's privacy. In this work we apply a
federated learning paradigm over a heterogeneous, siloed sets of
high-definition electrocardiogram arriving from 12-leads ECG sensors arrays to
train AI models. We evaluated the capacity of the resulting models to achieve
equivalent performance when compared to state-of-the-art models trained when
the same data is collected in a central place. Methods: We propose a privacy
preserving methodology for training AI models based on the federated learning
paradigm over a heterogeneous, distributed, dataset. The methodology is applied
to a broad range of machine learning techniques based on gradient boosting,
convolutional neural network and recurrent neural networks with long short-term
memory. The models were trained over a ECG dataset containing 12-leads
recordings collected from 43,059 patients from six geographically separate and
heterogeneous sources. Findings: The resulting set of AI models for detecting
cardiovascular abnormalities achieved comparable predictive performances
against models trained using a centralised learning approach. Interpretation:
The approach of compute parameters contributing to the global model locally and
then exchange only such parameters instead of the whole sensitive data as in ML
contributes to preserve medical data privacy.

to formulate a multiple-input estimation problem that necessitates certain
nodes to be measured and included as predictor inputs. However, some of these
nodes may not be measurable in many practical cases due to sensor selection and
placement issues. This may result in biased estimates of the target module.
Furthermore, the identification problem associated with the multiple-input
structure may require determining a large number of parameters that are not of
particular interest to the experimenter, with increased computational
complexity in large-sized networks. In this paper, we tackle these problems by
using a data augmentation strategy that allows us to reconstruct the missing
node measurements and increase the accuracy of the estimated target module. To
this end, we develop a system identification method using regularized
kernel-based methods coupled with approximate inference methods. Keeping a
parametric model for the module of interest, we model the other modules as
Gaussian Processes (GP) with a kernel given by the so-called stable spline
kernel. An Empirical Bayes (EB) approach is used to estimate the parameters of
the target module. The related optimization problem is solved using an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) method, where we employ a Markov-chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) technique to reconstruct the unknown missing node information and
the network dynamics. Numerical simulations on dynamic network examples
illustrate the potentials of the developed method.

to adopt classifier fusion strategies. A key point in the success of classifier
fusion approaches is the combination of diversity and accuracy among
classifiers belonging to an ensemble. With a large amount of classification
models available in the literature, one challenge is the choice of the most
suitable classifiers to compose the final classification system, which
generates the need of classifier selection strategies. We address this point by
proposing a framework for classifier selection and fusion based on a four-step
protocol called CIF-E (Classifiers, Initialization, Fitness function, and
Evolutionary algorithm). We implement and evaluate 24 varied ensemble
approaches following the proposed CIF-E protocol and we are able to find the
most accurate approach. A comparative analysis has also been performed among
the best approaches and many other baselines from the literature. The

typical compact binaries with component mass ranging from $1-100~M_{\odot}$.
The largest improvement for both distance inference and localization can be as
much as 1.5--3 orders of magnitude. We then construct the catalogs of dark
sirens observed by AEDGE in five years. We find eccentricity is crucial to the
detection of golden binary black holes (BBH) whose host galaxy can be uniquely
identified. With only 5--10 golden dark BBHs one can obtain a 2 percent
precision measurement of $H_0$ which is sufficient to arbitrate the Hubble
tension. Regardless of eccentricity, AEDGE can also observe tens of golden
binary neutron stars (BNS) and neutron star--black hole binaries (NSBH) with
unique host galaxies. These golden dark sirens can serve as early warnings for
the follow-up observations of gravitational waves in the high frequency band as

massively parallel transmission of signals via spatially separated channels,
thereby offering attractive bandwidth scaling with linearly increasing
technical effort. However, low-loss coupling of light between fiber arrays or
multicore fibers and standard linear arrays of vertical-cavity surface-emitting
lasers (VCSEL) or photodiodes (PD) still represents a challenge. In this paper,
we demonstrate that 3D-printed facet-attached microlenses (FaML) offer an
attractive path for connecting multimode fiber arrays as well as individual
cores of multimode multicore fibers to standard arrays of VCSEL or PD. The
freeform coupling elements are printed in situ with high precision on the
device and fiber facets by high-resolution multi-photon lithography. We
demonstrate coupling losses down to 0.35 dB along with lateral 1 dB alignment
tolerances in excess of 10 $\mu$m, allowing to leverage fast passive assembly
techniques that rely on industry-standard machine vision. To the best of our
knowledge, our experiments represent the first demonstration of a coupling
interface that connects individual cores of a multicore fiber to VCSEL or PD
arranged in a standard linear array without the need for additional fiber-based
or waveguide-based fan-out structures. Using this approach, we build a 3 x 25
Gbit/s transceiver assembly which fits into a small form-factor pluggable
module and which fulfills many performance metrics specified in the IEEE 802.3

events between asteroids in the main asteroid belt. Shock-darkening of ordinary
chondrites occurs at the onset of complete shock melting of the rock (>70 GPa)
or injection of sulfide and metal melt into the cracks within solid silicates
(\sim 50 GPa). Darkening of ordinary chondrites masks diagnostic silicate
features observed in the reflectance spectrum of S-complex asteroids so they
appear similar to C/X-complex asteroids. In this work, we investigate the shock
pressure and associated metamorphism pattern in rubble-pile asteroids at impact
velocities of 4-10 km/s. We use the iSALE shock physics code and implement
two-dimensional models with simplified properties in order to quantify the
influence of the following parameters on shock-darkening efficiency: impact
velocity, porosity within the asteroid, impactor size, and ejection efficiency.
We observe that, in rubble-pile asteroids, the velocity and size of the
impactor are the constraining parameters in recording high-grade shock
metamorphism. Yet, the recorded fraction of higher shock stages remains low
(<0.2). Varying the porosity of the boulders from 10% to 30% does not
significantly affect the distribution of pressure and fraction of
shock-darkened material. The pressure distribution in rubble-pile asteroids is
very similar to that of monolithic asteroids with the same porosity. Thus,
producing significant volumes of high-degree shocked ordinary chondrites
requires strong collision events (impact velocities above 8 km/s and/or large
sizes of impactors). A large amount of asteroid material escapes during an
impact event (up to 90%); however, only a small portion of the escaping
material is shock-darkened (6%).

  Reasoning",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Commonsense reasoning is an appealing topic in natural language processing
(NLP) as it plays a fundamental role in supporting the human-like actions of
NLP systems. With large-scale language models as the backbone, unsupervised
pre-training on numerous corpora shows the potential to capture commonsense
knowledge. Current pre-trained language model (PLM)-based reasoning follows the
traditional practice using perplexity metric. However, commonsense reasoning is
more than existing probability evaluation, which is biased by word frequency.
This paper reconsiders the nature of commonsense reasoning and proposes a novel
commonsense reasoning metric, Non-Replacement Confidence (NRC). In detail, it
works on PLMs according to the Replaced Token Detection (RTD) pre-training
objective in ELECTRA, in which the corruption detection objective reflects the
confidence on contextual integrity that is more relevant to commonsense
reasoning than existing probability. Our proposed novel method boosts zero-shot
performance on two commonsense reasoning benchmark datasets and further seven
commonsense question-answering datasets. Our analysis shows that pre-endowed
commonsense knowledge, especially for RTD-based PLMs, is essential in
downstream reasoning.

True chaotic behaviour sets in at the Thouless time, which can be extracted
from the energy spectrum. In order to do so, it is necessary to unfold the
spectrum, i.e., to filter out global tendencies. Using a simple ensemble
average for unfolding results in a parametically low estimation of the Thouless
energy. By examining the behavior of the spectrum as the distribution of the
matrix elements is changed into a log-normal distribution it is shown that the
sample to sample level spacing variance determines this estimation of the
Thouless energy. Using the singular value decomposition method, SVD, which
filters out these sample to sample fluctuations, the Thouless energy becomes
parametrically much larger, essentially of order of the band width. It is shown
that the SYK model in non-self-averaging even in the thermodynamic limit which

well-studied, it remains unknown whether their properties vary as their host

properties of IRIS bursts are consistent during the evolution of their host
ARs. We study 42 dense 400-step rasters sampled by IRIS. These rasters each
covered one of seven ARs, with each AR being sampled at least four times over a
minimum of 48 hours. An automated detection algorithm is used to identify IRIS
burst profiles. Data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager are also used to provide context about the co-spatial
line-of-sight magnetic field. Of the rasters studied, 36 were found to contain
IRIS burst profiles. Five ARs (11850, 11909, 11916, 12104, and 12139) contained
IRIS burst profiles in each raster that sampled them whilst one AR (11871) was
found to contain no such spectra at any time. A total of 4019 IRIS burst
profiles belonging to 752 connected objects, which we define as parent IRIS
bursts, were identified. IRIS burst profiles were only detected within compact
regions in each raster, with these regions appearing to increase in size as the
host ARs aged. No systematic changes in the frequency of IRIS burst profiles or
the spectral characteristic of IRIS burst profiles through time were found for
these ARs. Finally, 93 % of parent IRIS bursts with areas between 1 arcsec^2
and 4 arcsec^2 occurred co-spatial to bi-poles in the photosphere. Overall,
IRIS bursts have remarkably consistent spectral and spatial properties
throughout the evolution of ARs. These events predominantly form within the
cores of larger and more complex ARs, with the regions containing these events
appearing to increase in size as the host region itself evolves.

use of high pressures. Among many potential materials, layered materials such
as graphene present a practical advantage as they are lightweight. However,
graphene and other 2D materials typically bind H$_2$ too weakly to store it at

this paper, we propose Grad-Align+, a novel NA method using node attribute

so-called Grad-Align, that gradually discovers only a part of node pairs until
all node pairs are found. Specifically, Grad-Align+ is composed of the
following key components: 1) augmenting node attributes based on nodes'
centrality measures, 2) calculating an embedding similarity matrix extracted
from a graph neural network into which the augmented node attributes are fed,
and 3) gradually discovering node pairs by calculating similarities between
cross-network nodes with respect to the aligned cross-network neighbor-pair.
Experimental results demonstrate that Grad-Align+ exhibits (a) superiority over
benchmark NA methods, (b) empirical validation of our theoretical findings, and
(c) the effectiveness of our attribute augmentation module.

known for their detection across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with
diverse morphologies and spectral behaviour between these bands. The temporal
evolution of the morphology and spectrum of a PWN depends strongly on the
properties of the associated neutron star, the relativistic outflow powered by
its rotational energy, and surrounding medium, and thereby can vary markedly
between objects. Due the continuous, but decreasing, injection of electrons and
positrons into the PWN by the pulsar, the brightness and spectral variation
within and amongst their wind nebulae reflect the magnetic field structure and
particle transport within the PWN. This can include complex motions such as
reverse flows or turbulence due to shock interactions and disruption to the
nebula. During the last stage of the PWN's evolution, when the neutron star
moves supersonically with respect to its environment, the escape of accelerated
particles into the surrounding medium creates an extensive halo evident in
very-high-energy gamma-rays. This chapter describes some of the identifying
characteristics and key aspects of pulsar wind nebulae through their several
evolutionary stages.

crucial attributes strongly depend on the coupling between neighboring domains
in HZO which is quantified by gradient energy coefficient (g). Furthermore, HZO
has unique orientation-dependent lateral multidomain configurations, which
plays a key role for directional dependence of g. To develop an in-depth

dichalcogenides (TMD) monolayers. We employ well-known ab initio methods to
calculate the low-field carrier mobility in free-standing layers and use the
dielectric continuum approximation to extend our study to layers in double-gate
structures, including the effects of dielectric screening of the
electron-phonon interaction caused by the bottom oxide and the gate insulator,
and of scattering with hybrid interface optical-phonon/plasmon excitations
(`remote phonon scattering'). We find that the presence of insulators with a
high dielectric constant may improve significantly the carrier mobility.
However, scattering with the interface hybrid excitations negates this gain and
degrades the mobility significantly below its free-standing value. In a
double-gate geometry with SiO$_{2}$ as bottom-oxide and various top-gate
insulators, we find that the mobility decreases as the top-insulator dielectric
constant increases, as expected. However, a high mobility is predicted in the
case of the weakly polar hBN, and a mobility much lower than expected is
calculated in the case of gate-insulator/TMD/bottom-oxide stacks in which two
or more polar materials have optical-phonon with similar resonating
frequencies. We also find that the effect of screening by metal gates is
noticeable but not particularly strong. Finally, we discuss the effect of the
TMD dielectric constant, of the free-carrier density, and of temperature on the
transport properties of TMD monolayers.

Accordingly, we seek to characterize the extent of variation due to GPU PM in

find that DF44 formed 90 per cent of its stellar mass by $z\sim 0.9$ ($\sim
7.2$ Gyr ago). In comparison, using a prior that prefers concentrated star
formation (as informed by previous studies of DF44's stellar populations)
suggests that DF44 formed as early as $z\sim 8$ ($\sim 12.9$ Gyr ago).
Regardless of whether DF44 is old or very old, the SFHs imply early star
formation and rapid quenching. This result, together with DF44's large size and
evidence that it is on its first infall into the Coma cluster, challenges UDG
formation scenarios from simulations that treat all UDGs as contiguous with the

system operation resumes. Then the failure process of the system is the
superposition of renewal processes (or superimposed renewal process, SRP). If
the label of the components that cause the system to fail are unknown but the
times between failures are known, we refer to such data as {\it masked failure
data}. To estimate the SRP based on masked failure data is challenging.
  This paper obtains the lower and upper bounds of the rate of the SRP when
only masked failure data are available. If repair (rather than replacement) is
conducted on failed components, the failure process of the system is the
superposition of generalized renewal processes (SGRPs). The paper then derives
the lower and upper bounds of the rate of SGRPs and proposes to use a weighted
linear combination of the bounds to approximate the SGRP. Discussions are
provided for possible extensions of the bounds for systems with other
structures such as parallel systems. An algorithm for simulating the SGRP is
then proposed. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the proposed
approximation method.

of these results to the more general setting of fusion frames -- a fusion frame
is a collection of subspaces of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space with the
property that any vector can be recovered from its list of projections. The
notion of tightness extends to fusion frames, and we consider the following
basic question: is the collection of tight fusion frames with prescribed
subspace dimensions path connected? We answer (a generalization of) this
question in the affirmative, extending the analogous result for unit norm tight
frames proved by Cahill, Mixon and Strawn. We also extend a result of Benedetto
and Fickus, who defined a natural functional on the space of unit norm frames
(the frame potential), showed that its global minimizers are tight, and showed
that it has no spurious local minimizers, meaning that gradient descent can be
used to construct unit-norm tight frames. We prove the analogous result for the
fusion frame potential of Casazza and Fickus, implying that, when tight fusion
frames exist for a given choice of dimensions, they can be constructed via
gradient descent. Our proofs use techniques from symplectic geometry and

RDD in the context of perinatal epidemiology and birth cohort research.
  There is an increasing number of studies using RDD in perinatal and pediatric
epidemiology. Most of these studies were conducted in the context of education,
social and welfare policies, healthcare organization, insurance, and preventive
programs. Additional thematic fields include clinically relevant research
questions, shock events, social and environmental factors, and changes in
guidelines. Maternal and perinatal characteristics, such as age, birth weight
and gestational age are frequently used assignment variables to study the
effects of the type and intensity of neonatal care, health insurance, and
supplemental newborn benefits. Different socioeconomic measures have been used
to study the effects of social, welfare and cash transfer programs, while age
or date of birth served as assignment variables to study the effects of
vaccination programs, pregnancy-specific guidelines, maternity and paternity
leave policies and introduction of newborn-based welfare programs.
  RDD has advantages, including relatively weak and testable assumptions,
strong internal validity, intuitive interpretation, and transparent and simple
graphical representation. However, its use in birth cohort research is hampered
by the rarity of settings outside of policy and program evaluations, low
statistical power, limited external validity (geographic- and time-specific

values in cancers. However, very few automated, deep-learning-based TIL scoring
algorithms have been developed for colorectal cancers (CRC). Methods We
developed an automated, multiscale LinkNet workflow for quantifying
cellular-level TILs for CRC tumors using H&E-stained images. The predictive
performance of the automatic TIL scores (TIL) for disease progression and
overall survival was evaluate using two international datasets, including 554
CRC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 1130 CRC patients from
Molecular and Cellular Oncology (MCO). Results The LinkNet model provided an
outstanding precision (0.9508), recall (0.9185), and overall F1 score (0.9347).
Clear dose-response relationships were observed between TILs and risk of
disease progression or death decreased in both TCGA and MCO cohorts. Both
univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses for the TCGA data
demonstrated that patients with high TILs had significant (approx. 75%)
reduction of risk for disease progression. In both MCO and TCGA studies, the
TIL-high group was significantly associated with improved overall survival in
univariate analysis (30% and 54% reduction in risk, respectively). However,
potential confounding was observed in the MCO dataset. The favorable effects of
high TILs were consistently observed in different subgroups according to know
risk factors. Conclusion A deep-learning workflow for automatic TIL
quantification based on LinkNet was successfully developed.

  Stiff ODEs","Original Research Paper, 16 pages and 12 figures",,,,"cs.LG physics.chem-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently received much
attention due to their capabilities in solving both forward and inverse
problems. For training a deep neural network associated with a PINN, one
typically constructs a total loss function using a weighted sum of different
loss terms and then tries to minimize that. This approach often becomes
problematic for solving stiff equations since it cannot consider adaptive
increments. Many studies reported the poor performance of the PINN and its
challenges in simulating stiff chemical active issues with administering
conditions of stiff ordinary differential conditions (ODEs). Studies show that
stiffness is the primary cause of the failure of the PINN in simulating stiff
kinetic systems.
  Here, we address this issue by proposing a reduced weak-form of the loss
function, which led to a new PINN architecture, further named as Reduced-PINN,
that utilizes a reduced-order integration method to enable the PINN to solve
stiff chemical kinetics. The proposed Reduced-PINN can be applied to various
reaction-diffusion systems involving stiff dynamics. To this end, we transform
initial value problems (IVPs) to their equivalent integral forms and solve the
resulting integral equations using physics-informed neural networks. In our
derived integral-based optimization process, there is only one term without
explicitly incorporating loss terms associated with ordinary differential
equation (ODE) and initial conditions (ICs). To illustrate the capabilities of
Reduced-PINN, we used it to simulate multiple stiff/mild second-order ODEs. We
show that Reduced-PINN captures the solution accurately for a stiff scalar ODE.
We also validated the Reduced-PINN against a stiff system of linear ODEs.

to conduct practical federated learning (FL) tasks. Nevertheless, potential

novel block structure, new transaction types, and credit-based incentives,
PF-PoFL allows efficient artificial intelligence (AI) task outsourcing,
federated mining, model evaluation, and reward distribution in a fully
decentralized manner, while resisting spoofing and Sybil attacks. Besides,
PF-PoFL equips with a user-level differential privacy mechanism for miners to
prevent implicit privacy leakage in training FL models. Furthermore, by
considering dynamic miner characteristics (e.g., training samples, non-IID
degree, and network delay) under diverse FL tasks, a federation formation
game-based mechanism is presented to distributively form the optimized disjoint
miner partition structure with Nash-stable convergence. Extensive simulations
validate the efficiency and effectiveness of PF-PoFL.

disease, the most common neurodegenerative disease. The modeling of this
disease starts with the representation of the brain connectivity as a graph and
the seeding of a toxic protein in a specific region represented by a vertex.
Over time, the accumulation of toxic proteins at vertices and their propagation
along edges are modeled by a dynamical system on this graph. These dynamics
provide an order on the edges of the graph according to the damage created by
high concentrations of proteins. This sequence of edges defines a filtration of
the graph. We consider different filtrations given by different disease seeding
locations. To study this filtration we propose a new combinatorial and
topological method. A filtration defines a maximal chain in the partially
ordered set of spanning subgraphs ordered by inclusion. To identify similar
graphs, and define a topological signature, we quotient this poset by graph
homotopy equivalence, which gives maximal chains in a smaller poset. We provide
an algorithm to compute this direct quotient without computing all subgraphs
and then propose bounds on the total number of graphs up to homotopy
equivalence. To compare the maximal chains generated by this method, we extend
Kendall's $d_K$ metric for permutations to more general graded posets and
establish bounds for this metric. We then demonstrate the utility of this
framework on actual brain graphs by studying the dynamics of tau proteins on
the structural connectome. We show that the proposed topological brain chain
equivalence classes distinguish different simulated subtypes of Alzheimer's
disease.

variables such as entropy is difficult to define and measure in discrete
traffic models, it is shown how other more simple variables such as the
standard deviation can be enough to have a complete analysis of the system.
More specifically, it is shown how standard deviation can be seen as a measure
of order. Results from the study of the highway show how, taking a minimal

  Network-Load Learning, Prediction, and Resource Allocation",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Grant-Free (GF) access has been recognized as a promising candidate for
Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC). However, even with GF
access, URLLC still may not effectively gain high reliability and
millimeter-level latency, simultaneously. This is because the network load is
typically time-varying and not known to the base station (BS), and thus, the
resource allocated for GF access cannot well adapt to variations of the network
load, resulting in low resource utilization efficiency under light network load
and leading to severe collisions under heavy network load. To tackle this
problem, we propose a multi-tier-driven computing framework and the associated
algorithms for URLLC to support users with different QoS requirements.
Especially, we concentrate on K - repetition GF access in light of its
simplicity and well-balanced performance for practical systems. In particular,
our framework consists of three tiers of computation, namely network-load
learning, network-load prediction, and adaptive resource allocation. In the
first tier, the BS can learn the network-load information from the states
(success, collision, and idle) of random-access resources in terms of resource
blocks (RB) and time slots. In the second tier, the network-load variation is
effectively predicted based on estimation results from the first tier. Finally,
in the third tier, by deriving and weighing the failure probabilities of
different groups of users, their QoS requirements, and the predicted network
loads, the BS is able to dynamically allocate sufficient resources
accommodating the varying network loads. Simulation results show that our
proposed approach can estimate the network load more accurately compared with
the baseline schemes. Moreover, our adaptive resource allocation offers an
effective way to enhance the QoS for different URLLC services, simultaneously.

problems, many of which are still challenging to solve using conventional
digital solvers. In this work, we formulate two oscillator-inspired dynamical
systems to solve quintessential computationally intractable problems in Boolean
satisfiability (SAT). The system dynamics are engineered such that they
facilitate solutions to two different flavors of the SAT problem. We formulate
the first dynamical system to compute the solution to the 3-SAT problem, while
for the second system, we show that its dynamics map to the solution of the
Max-NAE-3-SAT problem. Our work advances understanding of how this
physics-inspired approach can be used to address challenging problems in
computing.

behavior of rejected cases. In this paper, we model credit in a brand new view
by capturing the sequential pattern of interactions among multiple stages of
loan business to make better use of the underlying causal relationship.
Specifically, we first define 3 stages with sequential dependence throughout
the loan process including credit granting(AR), withdrawal application(WS) and
repayment commitment(GB) and integrate them into a multi-task architecture.
Inside stages, an intra-stage multi-task classification is built to meet
different business goals. Then we design an Information Corridor to express
sequential dependence, leveraging the interaction information between customer
and platform from former stages via a hierarchical attention module controlling
the content and size of the information channel. In addition, semi-supervised
loss is introduced to deal with the unobserved instances. The proposed
multi-stage interaction sequence(MSIS) method is simple yet effective and
experimental results on a real data set from a top loan platform in China show
the ability to remedy the population bias and improve model generalization
ability.

(rule set) that best explains a classification data set. First, a large set of
decision rules is extracted from a set of decision trees trained on the data
set. The rule set should be concise, accurate, have a maximum coverage and
minimum number of inconsistencies. This problem can be formalized as a modified
version of the weighted budgeted maximum coverage problem, known to be NP-hard.
To solve the combinatorial optimization problem efficiently, we introduce a
nested genetic algorithm which we then use to derive explanations for ten
public data sets.

entangle other systems? The answer should be yes, as shown in what follows.
