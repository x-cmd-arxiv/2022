competitive family of algorithms that avoid many of the optimization pitfalls
associated with parameterized quantum circuit algorithms. While the vast
majority of the QSD algorithms have focused on solving the eigenpair problem
for ground, excited-state, and thermal observable estimation, there has been a
lot less work in considering QSD algorithms for the problem of quantum
dynamical simulation. In this work, we propose several quantum Krylov
fast-forwarding (QKFF) algorithms capable of predicting long-time dynamics well
beyond the coherence time of current quantum hardware. Our algorithms use
real-time evolved Krylov basis states prepared on the quantum computer and a
multi-reference subspace method to ensure convergence towards high-fidelity,
long-time dynamics. In particular, we show that the proposed multi-reference
methodology provides a systematic way of trading off circuit depth with
classical post-processing complexity. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach through numerical implementations for several quantum chemistry
problems including the calculation of the auto-correlation and dipole moment
correlation functions

they are `black boxes' to artists and content creators, they require large

issues by introducing a volume deformation method which is real-time, easy to
edit with off-the-shelf software and can extrapolate convincingly. To
demonstrate the versatility of our method, we apply it in two scenarios:
physics-based object deformation and telepresence where avatars are controlled
using blendshapes. We also perform thorough experiments showing that our method
compares favourably to both volumetric approaches combined with implicit
deformation and methods based on mesh deformation.

variable across the imaging field. In this paper, we propose a two-step scheme
to correct optical aberrations in a single raw or JPEG image, i.e., without any
prior information on the camera or lens. First, we estimate local Gaussian blur
kernels for overlapping patches and sharpen them with a non-blind deblurring
technique. Based on the measurements of the PSFs of dozens of lenses, these
blur kernels are modeled as RGB Gaussians defined by seven parameters. Second,
we remove the remaining lateral chromatic aberrations (not contemplated in the
first step) with a convolutional neural network, trained to minimize the
red/green and blue/green residual images. Experiments on both synthetic and

numerically computing the gradient (first-order information). However, the
sampling approach directly reduces the expensive gradient (first-order

avoids using the adjoint technique that requires large amounts of storage and

are implemented to obtain the CNOPs for two numerical models, the Burgers

obtained with their spatial structures, objective values, computation times and
nonlinear error growth. Compared with the performance of the three approaches,
the CNOPs' spatial structures, objective values, and nonlinear error growth is
nearly consistent, while the computation time using the sampling approach with

  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6948651",,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mechanistic induced polarization (IP) models describe the relationships
between the intrinsic properties of geomaterials and their frequency-dependent
complex conductivity spectra. However, the uncertainties associated with
estimating petrophysical properties from IP data are still poorly understood.
Therefore, practitioners rarely use mechanistic models to interpret actual IP
data. We propose a framework for critically assessing any IP model's
sensitivity and parameter estimation limitations. The framework consists of a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), an unsupervised Bayesian neural
network specializing in data dimension reduction and generative modeling. We
train the CVAE on the IP signatures of synthetic mixtures of metallic mineral
inclusions in electrolyte-filled host geomaterials and describe the effect of
data transformations on the model. First, the CVAE's Jacobian reveals the
relative importance of each petrophysical property for generating spectral IP
data. The most critical parameters are the conductivity of the host, the
volumetric content of the inclusions, the characteristic length of the
inclusions, and the permittivity of the host. The inclusions' diffusion
coefficient, permittivity, and conductivity, as well as the host's diffusion
coefficient, only have marginal importance for generative IP modeling. A
parameter estimation experiment yields the standardized accuracy of
petrophysical properties using various model constraints scenarios and
corroborates the sensitivity analysis results. Finally, we visualize the
effects of data transformations and model constraints on the petrophysical
parameter space. We conclude that a common logarithm data transformation yields
optimal parameter estimation results and that constraining the electrochemical
properties of the geomaterial improves estimates of the characteristic length
of its metallic inclusions and vice versa.

The plasma was generated by irradiation of a foam target with laser-induced

(C$_{9}$H$_{16}$O$_{8}$) foam of 2 mg/cm$^{-3}$ density, and $1$-mm interaction
length as target material. This kind of plasma is advantageous for
high-precision measurements, due to good uniformity and long lifetime compared
to the ion pulse length and the interaction duration. The plasma parameters
were diagnosed to be T$_{e}$=17 eV and n$_{e}$=4 $\times$ 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$.
The average charge states passing through the plasma were observed to be higher
than those predicted by the commonly-used semiempirical formula. Through
solving the rate equations, we attribute the enhancement to the target density
effects which will increase the ionization rates on one hand and reduce the
electron capture rates on the other hand. In previsous measurement with
partially ionized plasma from gas discharge and z-pinch to laser direct
irradiation, no target density effects were ever demonstrated. For the first

play a significant role in plasma near the critical density of Nd-Glass laser

this paper, we propose a Counterfactual Intervention Feature Transfer (CIFT)

employed interpolation methods. The reconstruction model defined in this manner
brings BCDI reconstruction into the scope of explicit optimization driven by
automatic differentiation. With results from simulations and experimental

climate change impacts, risk assessment, adaptation, and the protection of
living beings. Forecasting the occurrence probability of extreme heatwaves is a
primary challenge for risk assessment and attribution, but also for fundamental
studies about processes, dataset and model validation, and climate change
studies. In this work we develop a methodology to build forecasting models
which are based on convolutional neural networks, trained on extremely long
climate model outputs. We demonstrate that neural networks have positive
predictive skills, with respect to random climatological forecasts, for the
occurrence of long-lasting 14-day heatwaves over France, up to 15 days ahead of
time for fast dynamical drivers (500 hPa geopotential height fields), and also
at much longer lead times for slow physical drivers (soil moisture). This
forecast is made seamlessly in time and space, for fast hemispheric and slow
local drivers. We find that the neural network selects extreme heatwaves
associated with a North-Hemisphere wavenumber-3 pattern. The main scientific
message is that most of the time, training neural networks for predicting
extreme heatwaves occurs in a regime of lack of data. We suggest that this is
likely to be the case for most other applications to large scale atmosphere and
climate phenomena. For instance, using one hundred years-long training sets, a
regime of drastic lack of data, leads to severely lower predictive skills and
general inability to extract useful information available in the 500 hPa
geopotential height field at a hemispheric scale in contrast to the dataset of
several thousand years long. We discuss perspectives for dealing with the lack
of data regime, for instance rare event simulations and how transfer learning
may play a role in this latter task.

The observability of a kilonova depends on the amount of neutron star ejecta,
which is sensitive to the aligned component of the black hole spin. We explore
the dependence of the ejected mass on two main mechanisms that provide high
black hole spin in isolated stellar binaries. When the black hole inherits a
high spin from a Wolf-Rayet star that was born with least $\sim$ 10% of its
breakup spin under weak stellar core-envelope coupling, relevant for all
formation pathways, the median of the ejected mass is $\gtrsim$ $10^{-2}$
M$_{\odot}$. Though only possible for certain formation pathways, similar
ejected mass results when the black hole accretes $\gtrsim$ 20% of its
companion's envelope to gain a high spin. Together, these signatures suggest
that a population analysis of black-hole neutron-star binary mergers with
observed kilonovae may help distinguish between mechanisms for spin and
possible formation pathways. We show that these kilonovae will be difficult to
detect with current capabilities, but that future facilities, such as the Vera
Rubin Observatory, can do so even if the aligned dimensionless spin of the
black hole is as low as $\sim$ 0.2. Our model predicts kilonovae as bright as

of stellar masses (and luminosities) and environments. While we predict
significant redshift evolution of average ages and specific star formation
rates our core result is a mostly flat relationship of age and specific star
formation rate with stellar mass. We also find that galaxies in this epoch
predominantly have strongly rising star formation histories, albeit with the
magnitude dropping with redshift and stellar mass. In terms of chemical
enrichment we predict a strong stellar mass - metallicity relation present at
$z=10$ and beyond alongside significant $\alpha$-enhancement. Finally, we find
no environmental dependence of the relationship between age, specific star

we study the nonequilibrium transport of carriers within a system containing
two Dirac cones in both standard graphene and semi-Dirac graphene. In the
latter, the lattice modifications cause the relativistic and parabolic
dispersion bands to coexist, furnishing the Fermi surface with a rich
pseudospin texture and a versatile Dirac cones separation. We construct a
kinetic theory to investigate the carrier diffusion and uncover that the
pseudospin index contributes to the particle current and, like the real spin,
can induce a magnetoelectric effect, and argue that the pseudospin-charge

dynamics inside a quasi-one-dimensional conductor using the drift-diffusion
model and detect the pseudospin accumulation at the sample boundaries. We find
that, while, for graphene, the accumulation contributes to an extra voltage
drop between the sample interfaces, the semi-Dirac system presents a similar
accumulation that is strikingly equipped with valley polarization, signifying
an essential tool for the control of valley manipulation and chirality
transport using the pseudospin.

two main stages: prototypical representation learning and prototypical

could serve for all images with base and novel categories. This ability of
instance and category discrimination of the feature extractor is boosted by
self-supervised learning and adaptive prototypes. In the second stage, we
utilize the prototypes again to rectify offline pseudo labels and train a final
parametric classifier for category clustering. We conduct extensive experiments

weighted, directed, and with loops, are first converted to its adjacency matrix
A. Then by a naive infection model for graphs, we establish the corresponding
first-order matrix ODE, through which A's dominant eigenvalue is revealed by
the fastest growing term. When there are multiple dominant eigenvalues of the
same magnitude, the classical power iteration method can fail. In contrast, our
method can converge to the dominant eigenvalue even when same-magnitude

experiments comparing the convergence between our method and power iteration.
Our results show clear advantages over power iteration for tree graphs,
bipartite graphs, directed graphs with periods, and Markov chains with

count deformable mirrors over a small field of view), the lag time of the
correction (which can impact our system by the amount the wavefront has changed
by the time the system is able to apply the correction) which can be anywhere
from ~1-5 milliseconds, can cause wavefront errors on spatial scales that lead
to speckles at small angular separations from the central star in the final
science image. One avenue for correcting these aberrations is predictive
control, wherein previous wavefront information is used to predict the future
state of the wavefront in one-system-lag's time, and this predicted state is
applied as a correction with a deformable mirror. Here, we consider two methods
for predictive control: data-driven prediction using empirical orthogonal
functions and the physically-motivated predictive Fourier control. The
performance and robustness of these methods have not previously been compared
side-by-side. In this paper, we compare these predictors by applying them as

3$, selected using the first data from the JWST CEERS programme. Three of these
galaxies are at $4 < z < 5$, constituting the best evidence to date for
quiescent galaxies significantly before $z=4$. These extreme galaxies have
stellar masses in the range log$_{10}(M_*/$M$_\odot) = 10.1-11.1$, and formed
the bulk of their mass around $z \simeq 10$, with two objects having
star-formation histories that suggest they had already reached
log$_{10}(M_*/$M$_\odot) > 10$ by $z\gtrsim8$. We report number densities for
our sample, demonstrating that, based on the small area of JWST imaging so far
available, previous work appears to have underestimated the number of quiescent
galaxies at $3 < z < 4$ by a factor of $3-5$, due to a lack of ultra-deep
imaging data at $\lambda>2\,\mu$m. This result deepens the existing tension
between observations and theoretical models, which already struggle to
reproduce previous estimates of $z>3$ quiescent galaxy number densities.
Upcoming wider-area JWST imaging surveys will provide larger samples of such
galaxies and more-robust number densities, as well as providing opportunities
to search for quiescent galaxies at $z>5$. The galaxies we report are excellent
potential targets for JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy, which will be required to
understand in detail their physical properties, providing deeper insights into
the processes responsible for forming massive galaxies and quenching star
formation during the first billion years.

feature compensation step, is able to enhance ASR systems under such conditions
by simulating the in-domain noisy speeches from the clean counterparts. Yet,
existing distortion models are either non-trainable or unexplainable and often
lack controllability and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a
fully explainable and controllable model: DENT-DDSP to achieve EDM. DENT-DDSP
utilizes novel differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) components and
requires only 10 seconds of training data to achieve high fidelity. The
experiment shows that the simulated noisy data from DENT-DDSP achieves the
highest simulation fidelity compared to other baseline models in terms of
multi-scale spectral loss (MSSL). Moreover, to validate whether the data
simulated by DENT-DDSP are able to replace the scarce in-domain noisy data in
the noise-robust ASR tasks, several downstream ASR models with the same
architecture are trained using the simulated data and the real data. The
experiment shows that the model trained with the simulated noisy data from
DENT-DDSP achieves similar performances to the benchmark with a 2.7\%
difference in terms of word error rate (WER). The code of the model is released
online.

vital in understanding the matter distribution in the Universe. It also enables
understanding the cosmological evolution of dark matter density fields and the
relationship between dark matter and luminous matter. Clustering studies are
also required for EoR foreground studies since it affects the relevant angular
scales. This paper investigates the angular and spatial clustering properties
and the bias parameter of radio-selected sources in the Lockman Hole field at
325 MHz. The data probes sources with fluxes $\gtrsim$0.3 mJy within a radius
of 1.8$^\circ$ around the phase center of a $6^\circ \times 6^\circ$ mosaic.
Based on their radio luminosity, the sources are classified into Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and Star-Forming Galaxies (SFGs). Clustering and bias
parameters are determined for the combined populations and the classified
sources. The spatial correlation length and the bias of AGNs are greater than
SFGs -- indicating that more massive haloes host the former. This study is the
first reported estimate of the clustering property of sources at 325 MHz,
intermediate between the preexisting studies at high and low-frequency bands.
It also probes a well-studied deep field at an unexplored frequency with
moderate depth and area. Clustering studies require such observations along
different lines of sight, with various fields and data sets across frequencies
to avoid cosmic variance and systematics. Thus, an extragalactic deep field has
been studied in this work to contribute to this knowledge.

the low energy electronic structure of quantum materials. However, the
measurement of QPI by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is restricted to
surfaces and is thus inherently constrained to two dimensions. This has proved
immensely successful for the study of materials that exhibit a
quasi-two-dimensional electronic structure, yet it raises questions about how
to interpret QPI in materials that have a highly three dimensional electronic
structure. In this paper we address this question and establish the methodology
required to simulate and understand QPI arising from three dimensional systems
as measured by STM. We calculate the continuum surface Green's function in the
presence of a defect, which captures the role of the surface and the vacuum
decay of the wave functions. We find that defects at different depths from the
surface will produce unique sets of scattering vectors for three dimensional
systems, which nevertheless can be related to the three-dimensional electronic
structure of the bulk material. We illustrate the consequences that the
three-dimensionality of the electronic structure has on the measured QPI for a
simple cubic nearest-neighbour tight-binding model, and then demonstrate
application to a real material using a realistic model for PbS. Our method
unlocks the use of QPI imaging for the study of quantum materials with three
dimensional electronic structures and introduces a framework to generically
account for $k_z$-dispersions within QPI simulations.

high-contrast imaging and enable both the direct detection of Saturn-mass
planets and the characterization of substellar companions in the mid-infrared.
While JWST will feature unprecedented sensitivity, angular resolution will be
the key factor when competing with ground-based telescopes. Here, we aim to
characterize the performance of several extreme angular resolution imaging
techniques available with JWST in the 3-5 micron regime based on data taken
during commissioning. Firstly, we introduce custom tools to simulate, reduce,
and analyze NIRCam and MIRI coronagraphy data and use these tools to extract
companion detection limits from on-sky NIRCam round and bar mask coronagraphy
observations. Secondly, we present on-sky NIRISS aperture masking
interferometry (AMI) and kernel phase imaging (KPI) observations from which we
extract companion detection limits using the publicly available fouriever tool.
Scaled to a total integration time of one hour and a target of the brightness
of AB Dor, we find that NIRISS AMI and KPI reach contrasts of $\sim$7-8 mag at
$\sim$70 mas and $\sim$9 mag at $\sim$200 mas. Beyond $\sim$250 mas, NIRCam
coronagraphy reaches deeper contrasts of $\sim$13 mag at $\sim$500 mas and
$\sim$15 mag at $\sim$2 arcsec. While the bar mask performs $\sim$1 mag better
than the round mask at small angular separations $\lesssim$0.75 arcsec, it is
the other way around at large angular separations $\gtrsim$1.5 arcsec.
Moreover, the round mask gives access to the full 360 deg field-of-view which
is beneficial for the search of new companions. We conclude that already during
the instrument commissioning, JWST high-contrast imaging in the L- and M-bands
performs close to its predicted limits.

high-dimensional functions remains a fundamental challenge. A popular belief is
that these models harness the local and hierarchical structure of natural data
such as images. Yet, we lack a quantitative understanding of how such structure
affects performance, e.g., the rate of decay of the generalisation error with
the number of training samples. In this paper, we study infinitely-wide deep
CNNs in the kernel regime. First, we show that the spectrum of the
corresponding kernel inherits the hierarchical structure of the network, and we
characterise its asymptotics. Then, we use this result together with
generalisation bounds to prove that deep CNNs adapt to the spatial scale of the
target function. In particular, we find that if the target function depends on
low-dimensional subsets of adjacent input variables, then the decay of the
error is controlled by the effective dimensionality of these subsets.
Conversely, if the target function depends on the full set of input variables,
then the error decay is controlled by the input dimension. We conclude by
computing the generalisation error of a deep CNN trained on the output of
another deep CNN with randomly-initialised parameters. Interestingly, we find
that, despite their hierarchical structure, the functions generated by
infinitely-wide deep CNNs are too rich to be efficiently learnable in high

the action in terms of the supersymmetric chemical potentials and match the

Accordingly, a number of heuristics and approximation algorithms have been

However, such stabilization loops operate by pushing noise to frequencies

deleterious effects for certain applications. The prevailing approach to
filtering this noise is to pass the laser through a high finesse optical
cavity, which places constraints on the system design. Here, we propose and
demonstrate a different approach where a frequency error signal is derived from
a beat note between the laser and the light that passes through the reference

electro-optic modulator after the laser, carefully accounting for relative
delay, for real-time frequency correction. With a Hz-linewidth laser, we show
$\gtrsim20$ dB noise suppression at the peak of the servo bump ($\approx250$
kHz), and a noise suppression bandwidth of $\approx5$ MHz -- well beyond the
servo bump. By simulating the Rabi dynamics of a two-level atom with our
measured data, we demonstrate substantial improvements to the pulse fidelity
over a wide range of Rabi frequencies. Our approach offers a simple and

required in many emerging applications of cold atoms, and is readily compatible

lexical specialization of monolingual PLMs with immense quantities of
monolingual constraints, in this work we expose massively multilingual

specialization procedure guided by a contrastive objective. We show that such
massively multilingual lexical specialization brings substantial gains in two
standard cross-lingual lexical tasks, bilingual lexicon induction and
cross-lingual word similarity, as well as in cross-lingual sentence retrieval.
Crucially, we observe gains for languages unseen in specialization, indicating
that multilingual lexical specialization enables generalization to languages

we show that the number of specialization constraints plays a much greater role

example setup compatible with this principle, the AdS/CFT correspondence relies
on the existence of D-branes in superstring theory. Black hole complementarity
is inevitably linked to holography and states that information associated with
the collapsed pure state is reflected in the near horizon region. Yet, if this
is so, it is indispensable to understand the mechanism that makes black holes
viewed from the outside evolve unitarily. We here argue that the information
preserving quantum atmosphere of the black hole emerges from hidden variables
on its horizon which would necessitate going beyond a probabilistic description
within standard quantum theory. In AdS/CFT, this would mean that the completion
of the semiclassical subalgebra to the complete boundary algebra has to be
traced back to the emergent near horizon Hilbert space structure. The present
investigations suggest that spacetime horizons, in general, may play a crucial

evaluates the transversely projected vertex, spanned on a special tensorial

Bose-symmetric variables. Quite interestingly, when evaluated in these
kinematics, the corresponding form factors depend almost exclusively on a
single kinematic variable, formed by the sum of the squares of the three
incoming four-momenta, $q$, $r$, and $p$. Thus, all configurations lying on a
given plane in the coordinate system $(q^2, r^2, p^2)$ share, to a high degree
of accuracy, the same form factors, a property that we denominate \emph{planar

exhaustive study of the set of configurations satisfying the condition $q^2 =
r^2$, within the range $[0, 5\, \rm GeV]$. Moreover, a preliminary exploration
reveals that the planar degeneracy persist in the case of more arbitrary
configurations. This drastic simplification allows for a remarkably compact
description of the main bulk of the data, which is particularly suitable for
future numerical applications. A semi-perturbative analysis reproduces the
lattice findings rather accurately, once the inclusion of a gluon mass has

paired images, the proposed approach is based on datasets that are not
necessarily paired. Within a real and a simulated dataset, A and B,
respectively, we find subsets Ac and Bc of similar content and judge,
statistically, the perception algorithm's response to these similar subsets.
This validation approach obtains a statistical measure of performance
similarity, as well as a measure of similarity between the content of A and B.
The methodology is demonstrated using images generated with Chrono::Sensor and
a scaled autonomous vehicle, using an object detector as the perception

angular momentum, both in the image plane and along the line of sight
velocities. The streamer has a mean infall rate of $1.3 \times 10^{ -6}$ M$_{
\odot}$ yr$^{ -1}$, $5 -10$ times higher than the current accretion rate of the
protostar. SO and SO$_2$ emission reveal asymmetric infall motions in the inner
envelope, additional to the streamer around Per-emb-50. Furthermore, the
presence of SO$_2$ could mark the impact zone of the infalling material.
Conclusions. The streamer delivers sufficient mass to sustain the protostellar
accretion rate and might produce an accretion burst, which would explain the
protostar's high luminosity with respect to other Class I sources. Our results
highlight the importance of late infall for protostellar evolution: streamers
might provide a significant amount of mass for stellar accretion after the
Class 0 phase.

  of plane linearly polarized electromagnetic waves by subwavelength particles","20 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables",,,,"physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present the results of a study of the Poynting vector field generic
singularities at the resonant light scattering of a plane monochromatic
linearly polarized electromagnetic wave by a subwavelength particle. We reveal
the impact of the problem symmetry, the spatial dimension, and the energy
conservation law on the properties of the singularities. We show that, in the
cases when the problem symmetry results in the existence of an invariant plane
for the Poynting vector field lines, a formation of a standing wave in the
immediate vicinity of a singularity gives rise to a saddle-type singular point.
All other types of singularities are associated with vanishing at the singular
points, either (i) magnetic field, for the polarization plane parallel to the
invariant plane, or (ii) electric field, at the perpendicular orientation of
the polarization plane. We also show that in the case of two-dimensional
problems (scattering by a cylinder), the energy conservation law restricts the
types of possible singularities only to saddles and centers in the
non-dissipative media and to saddles, foci, and nodes in dissipative. Finally,
we show that dissipation affects the (i)-type singularities much stronger than
the (ii)-type. The same conclusions are valid for the imaginary part of the
Poynting vector in problems where the latter is regarded as a complex quantity.
The singular points associated with the formation of standing waves are
different for real and imaginary parts of this complex vector field, while all
other singularities are common. We illustrate the general discussion by
analyzing singularities at light scattering by a subwavelength Germanium
cylinder with the actual dispersion of its refractive index.

progressively unveils an infinite connected component in the random

parallaxes also have smaller systematic uncertainty because their stars lie in
the range (G>13 mag) where the Gaia parallax calibration is most comprehensive.
Cepheid photometry employed in the period--luminosity relation was measured
using the same instrument(WFC3) and filters(F555W,F814W,F160W) as extragalactic
Cepheids in SNIa hosts. We find no evidence of residual parallax offset in this
magnitude range, zp=-3+/-4 muas, consistent with Lindegren:2021b and most
studies. The Cepheid luminosity (P=10d, solar-metallicity) in the HST
near-infrared, Wesenheit system derived from the cluster sample is
M_{H,1}^W=-5.902+/-0.025 and -5.890+/-0.018 mag with or without simultaneous
determination of a parallax offset, respectively. These results are similar to
measurements from field Cepheids, confirming the accuracy of the Gaia
parallaxes over a broad range of magnitudes. The SH0ES distance ladder
calibrated solely from this sample gives H_0=72.8+/-1.3 and H_0=73.2+/-1.1

begins with a past null singularity, where Weyl tensor vanishes when the metric
is initially exactly conformally flat. This initial state precisely obeys
Penrose's conditions. The initial null singularity breaks $T$-reversal
spontaneously and picks the arrow of time. It can be regulated and interpreted
as a creation of a universe from nothing, initially fitting in a bubble of
Planckian size when it materializes. Penrose's initial conditions are favored
by the initial $O(4)$ symmetry of the bubble, selected by extremality of the

models we use both a standard, time-domain waveform alignment and a
gauge-invariant analysis based on the dimensionless function
$Q_\omega(\omega)\equiv \omega^2/\dot{\omega}$, where $\omega$ is the
gravitational wave frequency. We analyse the domain of validity of the 1PAT1
model, deriving error estimates and showing that the effects of the final
transition to plunge, which the model neglects, extend over a significantly
larger frequency interval than one might expect. Restricting to the inspiral
regime, we find that, while for mass ratios $q = m_1/m_2\le 10$ TEOBResumS is
largely indistinguishable from NR, 1PAT1 has a significant dephasing $\gtrsim
1$rad; conversely, for $q\gtrsim 100$, 1PAT1 is estimated to have phase errors
$<0.1$rad on a large frequency interval, while TEOBResumS develops phase
differences $\gtrsim1$rad with it. Most crucially, on that same large frequency
interval we find good agreement between TEOBResumS and 1PAT1 in the
intermediate regime $15\lesssim q\lesssim 64$, with $<0.5$rad dephasing between
them. A simple modification to the TEOBResumS flux further improves this
agreement for $q\gtrsim 30$, reducing the dephasing to $\approx0.27$rad even at

models for both intermediate and extreme mass ratio inspirals for the next

dynamics of the internally fast rotating member galaxies within these
protoclusters resembles observations, merging rapidly to form the cores of the
BCGs of the assembling clusters. Half of the gas reservoir of these structures
is in a hot phase, with the metal-enrichment at a very early stage. These
systems show a good agreement with the observed amount of cold star-forming
gas, largely enriched to solar values. We predict that some of the member
galaxies are already quenched at z = 4, rendering them undetectable through
measurements of their gas reservoir. Tracing the evolution of protoclusters
reveals that none of the typical mass indicators at high redshift are good
tracers to predict the present-day mass of the system. We find that none of the
simulated protoclusters with properties as SPT2349-56 at z = 4.3, are among the
top ten most massive clusters at redshift z = 0, with some barely reaching

reasonably well, the simulation fails to reproduce the extremely high total
star-formation rates within observed protoclusters, indicating that the
sub-grid models are lacking the ability to reproduce higher star-formation
efficiency (or lower depletion timescales).

the clustering algorithm in two spaces, in velocity space in order to study
recently accreted structures, and in action-angle space to find phase-mixed

space) that are consistently not associated with noise. They are attributed to
the known structures: the Gaia Sausage-Enceladus, the Helmi Stream, and
globular cluster NGC 3201 are found in both spaces, while NGC 104 and the thick

discuss the kinematic properties of these structures and study whether many of
the small clusters belong to a similar larger cluster based on their chemical
abundances. Although we do not identify any new structures, we find that the
HDBSCAN member selection of already known structures is unstable to input
kinematics of the stars when resampled within their uncertainties. We therefore
present the most stable subset of local kinematic structures, which are

sufficiently ionized accretion disks, as it can create turbulence that acts as
an effective viscosity, mediating angular momentum transport. Due to its local
nature, it is often analyzed in the shearing box approximation with Eulerian
methods, which otherwise would suffer from large advection errors in global
disk simulations. In this work, we report on an extensive study that applies
the quasi-Lagrangian, moving-mesh code ${\rm \small AREPO}$, combined with the
Dedner cleaning scheme to control deviations from $\nabla \cdot B = 0$, to the
problem of magnetized flows in shearing boxes. We find that we can resolve the
analytical linear growth rate of the MRI with mean background magnetic field
well. In the zero net flux case, there is a threshold value for the strength of
the divergence cleaning above which the turbulence eventually dies out, and in
contrast to previous Eulerian simulations, the strength of the MRI does not
decrease with increasing resolution. If we increase the vertical aspect ratio
of our box we find the mean-field dynamo described in Shi et al. (2016), as
well as an active shear current effect that can sustain MRI turbulence for at
least 200 orbits. In stratified simulations, we obtain an active $\alpha
\omega$ dynamo and the characteristic butterfly diagram, again for at least 200
orbits. Our results compare well with previous results obtained with static
grid codes such as ${\rm\small ATHENA}$. We thus conclude that ${\rm \small
AREPO}$ represents a particularly attractive alternative for global disk

well as for shearing box simulations with large density variations, where ${\rm

sequence consisting of in-context examples (input-output pairs corresponding to

Crucially, in-context learning happens only at inference time without any
parameter updates to the model. While large language models such as GPT-3
exhibit some ability to perform in-context learning, it is unclear what the
relationship is between tasks on which this succeeds and what is present in the
training data. To make progress towards understanding in-context learning, we
consider the well-defined problem of training a model to in-context learn a
function class (e.g., linear functions): that is, given data derived from some
functions in the class, can we train a model to in-context learn ""most""
functions from this class? We show empirically that standard Transformers can
be trained from scratch to perform in-context learning of linear functions --
that is, the trained model is able to learn unseen linear functions from
in-context examples with performance comparable to the optimal least squares
estimator. In fact, in-context learning is possible even under two forms of
distribution shift: (i) between the training data of the model and
inference-time prompts, and (ii) between the in-context examples and the query
input during inference. We also show that we can train Transformers to

$\omega_c$, $\omega_b$, and $n_s$, as well as the evolution parameters $h$,
$A_s$, $\Omega_K$, $w_0$, and $w_a$. This flexibility does not impair COMET's
accuracy, since we exploit an exact degeneracy between the evolution parameters
that allows us to train the emulator on a significantly reduced parameter
space. While the predictions are sped up by at least two orders of magnitude,
validation tests reveal an accuracy of $0.1\,\%$ for the monopole and
quadrupole ($0.3\,\%$ for the hexadecapole), or alternatively, better than
$0.25\,\sigma$ for all three multipoles in comparison to statistical
uncertainties expected for the Euclid survey with a tenfold increase in volume.
We show that these differences translate into shifts in mean posterior values
that are at most of the same size, meaning that COMET can be used with the same
confidence as the exact underlying models. COMET is a publicly available Python
package that also provides the tree-level bispectrum multipoles in
redshift-space and Gaussian covariance matrices.

nonlinear dissipative media. The existence of such solitons requires to
maintain two balances: between nonlinear self-focusing and linear diffraction
and/or dispersion, and between loss and gain. Due to these conditions,
dissipative solitons (DSs) exist not in families, but as isolated solutions.
The main issue is stability of 2D and 3D DSs, especially vortical ones. First,
stable 2D DSs are presented in the framework of the complex Ginzburg-Landau
equation with the cubic-quintic (CQ) nonlinearity, which combines linear and
quintic loss with cubic gain. In addition to fundamental (zero-vorticity) DSs,
stable spiral DSs are presented too, with vorticities 1 and 2. Stable 2D
solitons were also found in a system of two linearly-coupled fields, with
linear gain acting in one and linear loss in the other. In this case, the cubic
loss (without quintic terms) is sufficient for the stability of fundamental and
vortex DSs. In addition to truly localized states, weakly localized ones are
presented too, in a model with nonlinear loss without explicit gain, the losses
being compensated by influx of power from infinity. Other classes of 2D models
which are considered here use spatially modulated loss or gain to predict many
species of robust DSs, including ones featuring complex periodically recurring
metamorphoses. Stable fundamental and vortex solitons are also produced by
models with a trapping or spatially periodic potential. In the latter case, 2D
gap DSs are considered. Further, 2D dissipative models with spin-orbit coupling
give rise to stable semi-vortices, with vorticity carried by one component.
Along with the 2D solitons, the review includes 3D fundamental and vortex DSs,
stabilized by the CQ nonlinearity and/or external potentials, and collisions
between them.

construct the corresponding four-dimensional plane wave background keeping also
post-plane wave corrections, as well as all the non-trivial
$\lambda$-dependence. After imposing the light-cone gauge and the Virasoro
constraints, we obtain an interacting field theory for the transverse physical
modes which are massive. We explicitly demonstrate the absence of particle
production to leading order in the large $k$-expansion. This is based crucially
on the form of the interaction vertices and their dependence on the
$\lambda$-deformation parameter. In addition, we compute the $S$-matrix for the
two-particle elastic scattering exactly in $\lambda$ and to leading order in
the large $k$-expansion. Our method can be applied to any integrable theory
with at least one isometry.

few at very-high energies (VHEs, > 100GeV). The HAWC gamma-ray observatory is
well suited to study transient phenomena at VHEs due to its large field of view
and duty cycle. These features allow for searches of VHE emission and can probe
different model assumptions of duration and spectra. In this paper, we use data
collected by HAWC between December 2014 and May 2020 to search for emission in
the energy range from 80 to 800 GeV coming from a sample 47 short GRBs that
triggered the Fermi, Swift and Konus satellites during this period. This
analysis is optimized to search for delayed and extended VHE emission within
the first 20 s of each burst. We find no evidence of VHE emission, either
simultaneous or delayed, with respect to the prompt emission. Upper limits (90%
confidence level) derived on the GRB fluence are used to constrain the
synchrotron self-Compton forward-shock model. Constraints for the interstellar
density as low as $10^{-2}$ cm$^{-3}$ are obtained when assuming z=0.3 for
bursts with the highest keV-fluences such as GRB 170206A and GRB 181222841.
Such a low density makes observing VHE emission mainly from the fast cooling

the ImageNet data set. To detect OOD data for multi-label classification, we
proposed in-distribution voting (IDV). The OOD detection performance is
measured across data sets using the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC) analysis and compared with Mahalanobis-based OOD
detection, MaxLogit, MaxEnergy and self-supervised OOD detection (SS OOD).
Without additional OOD detection, the chest X-ray classifier failed to discard
any OOD images, with an AUC of 0.5. The proposed IDV approach trained on ID

Mahalanobis-based OOD detection achieved an average OOD detection AUC of 0.982.
IDV trained solely with a few thousand ImageNet images had an AUC 0.913, which
was higher than MaxLogit (0.726), MaxEnergy (0.724), and SS OOD (0.476). The
performance of all tested OOD detection methods did not translate well to

improved the model's ID classification performance, even when trained with data

most of the sources are formed in globular clusters. On the other hand, a
globular cluster origin can account for the inferred secondary peak at
$m_1\simeq 35M_\odot$, which requires that the most massive clusters form with
half-mass densities $\rho_{\rm h,0} \gtrsim 10^4 M_\odot \rm pc^{-3}$. Finally,
we find that the lack of a high mass cut--off in the inferred mass distribution
can be also explained by the repopulation of an initial mass gap through
hierarchical mergers. Matching the inferred merger rate above $\simeq
50M_\odot$ requires both initial cluster densities $\rho_{\rm h,0} \gtrsim 10^4
M_\odot \rm pc^{-3}$, and that black holes form with nearly zero spin. A

Solutions of such a dismantling problem are important for the design of optimal
strategies of disease containment based either on immunization or social
distancing. Depending on the specific variant of the problem considered,
network dismantling is performed via the removal of nodes or edges, and
different cost functions are associated to the removal of these microscopic
elements. In this paper, we show that network representations in geometric
space can be used to solve several variants of the network dismantling problem
in a coherent fashion. Once a network is embedded, dismantling is implemented
using intuitive geometric strategies. We demonstrate that the approach well
suits both Euclidean and hyperbolic network embeddings. Our systematic analysis
on synthetic and real networks demonstrates that the performance of
embedding-aided techniques is comparable to, if not better than, the one of the
best dismantling algorithms currently available on the market.

determine the amount of $\mathrm{H_2O}$ and $\mathrm{CO_2}$ ice that are lost
from icy dust assemblages of different sizes during transfer through the coma,

  We use various numerical simulations, that include orbit dynamics,
thermophysics of the nucleus and of individual coma aggregates, coma gas
kinetics and hydrodynamics, as well as dust dynamics due to gas drag, to
address these questions. We find that the thickness of accumulated airfall
material varies substantially with location, and typically is of the order
$0.1$-$1\,\mathrm{m}$. The airfall material preserves substantial amounts of
water ice even in relatively small (cm-sized) coma aggregates after a rather
long ($12\,\mathrm{h}$) residence in the coma. However, $\mathrm{CO_2}$ is lost
within a couple of hours even in relatively large (dm-sized) aggregates, and is
not expected to be an important component in airfall deposits. We introduce
reachability and survivability indices to measure the relative capacity of
different regions to simultaneously collect airfall and to preserve its water
ice until the next perihelion passage, thereby grading their potential of
contributing to comet activity during the next perihelion passage.

the traditional purely shape- or kinematics-based classifications are
insufficient to characterize the diversity of our sample and define a new set

correspond to six distinct populations of galaxies: the rapid AM reorienters
(58% of our sample), unsettled galaxies (10%), spinning disks (10%), twirling
cigars (16%), misaligned slow reorienters (3%), and regular prolate rotators
(galaxies that display major axis rotation; 2%). We demonstrate that the
most-recent significant (mass-ratio $\mu>1/10$) mergers of these galaxies are
the primary cause for their present-day properties and find that these mergers
are best characterized at the point of the satellite's final infall -- that is,
much closer to the final coalescence than has been previously thought. We show
that regular prolate rotators evolve from spinning disk progenitors that
experience a radial merger along their internal AM direction. Finally, we argue
that these regular prolate rotators are distinct from the similarly-sized
population of rapid AM reorienters with large $\Psi_\mathrm{int}$, implying
that a large $\Psi_\mathrm{int}$ is not a sufficient condition for major axis
rotation.

  snowball literature review of an emerging practice","Accepted for publication at Open Source Systems (OSS) Conference 2022",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Motivation: Society's dependence on Open Source Software (OSS) and the
communities that maintain the OSS is ever-growing. So are the potential risks
of, e.g., vulnerabilities being introduced in projects not actively maintained.
By assessing an OSS project's capability to stay viable and maintained over
time without interruption or weakening, i.e., the OSS health, users can
consider the risk implied by using the OSS as is, and if necessary, decide
whether to help improve the health or choose another option. However, such
assessment is complex as OSS health covers a wide range of sub-topics, and
existing support is limited. Aim: We aim to create an overview of
characteristics that affect the health of an OSS project and enable the
assessment thereof. Method: We conduct a snowball literature review based on a
start set of 9 papers, and identify 146 relevant papers over two iterations of
forward and backward snowballing. Health characteristics are elicited and coded
using structured and axial coding into a framework structure. Results: The
final framework consists of 104 health characteristics divided among 15 themes.
Characteristics address the socio-technical spectrum of the community of actors
maintaining the OSS project, the software and other deliverables being
maintained, and the orchestration facilitating the maintenance. Characteristics
are further divided based on the level of abstraction they address, i.e., the
OSS project-level specifically, or the project's overarching ecosystem of
related OSS projects. Conclusion: The framework provides an overview of the
wide span of health characteristics that may need to be considered when
evaluating OSS health and can serve as a foundation both for research and
practice.

  with Network Dependencies","to appear at IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code
  Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM)",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Flaky tests cause significant problems as they can interrupt automated build
processes that rely on all tests succeeding and undermine the trustworthiness
of tests. Numerous causes of test flakiness have been identified, and program
analyses exist to detect such tests. Typically, these methods produce advice to
developers on how to refactor tests in order to make test outcomes
deterministic. We argue that one source of flakiness is the lack of assumptions
that precisely describe under which circumstances a test is meaningful. We
devise a sanitisation technique that can isolate f laky tests quickly by
inferring such assumptions on-the-fly, allowing automated builds to proceed as
flaky tests are ignored. We demonstrate this approach for Java and Groovy
programs by implementing it as extensions for three popular testing frameworks
(JUnit4, JUnit5 and Spock) that can transparently inject the inferred
assumptions. If JUnit5 is used, those extensions can be deployed without
refactoring project source code. We demonstrate and evaluate the utility of our
approach using a set of six popular real-world programs, addressing known test
flakiness issues in these programs caused by dependencies of tests on network
availability. We find that our method effectively sanitises failures induced by
network connectivity problems with high precision and recall.

response of color centers in diamond in the presence of externally engineered

that our network manages to efficiently reconstruct the spectral density of the
underlying fluctuating magnetic field with good fidelity under a broad set of

substantial experimental noise. These proof-of-principle results create
opportunities for the application of machine-learning methods to

Using the weak solution approach, an explicit formula for the Fr\'echet

have led to its widespread adoption in practical applications. However, this
opportunity comes with significant underlying risks, as many of these models
rely on privacy-sensitive data for training in a variety of applications,
making them an overly-exposed threat surface for privacy violations.
Furthermore, the widespread use of cloud-based Machine-Learning-as-a-Service
(MLaaS) for its robust infrastructure support has broadened the threat surface
to include a variety of remote side-channel attacks. In this paper, we first
identify and report a novel data-dependent timing side-channel leakage (termed
Class Leakage) in DL implementations originating from non-constant time
branching operation in a widely used DL framework PyTorch. We further
demonstrate a practical inference-time attack where an adversary with user
privilege and hard-label black-box access to an MLaaS can exploit Class Leakage
to compromise the privacy of MLaaS users. DL models are vulnerable to
Membership Inference Attack (MIA), where an adversary's objective is to deduce
whether any particular data has been used while training the model. In this
paper, as a separate case study, we demonstrate that a DL model secured with
differential privacy (a popular countermeasure against MIA) is still vulnerable
to MIA against an adversary exploiting Class Leakage. We develop an
easy-to-implement countermeasure by making a constant-time branching operation
that alleviates the Class Leakage and also aids in mitigating MIA. We have
chosen two standard benchmarking image classification datasets, CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 to train five state-of-the-art pre-trained DL models, over two

report here the observation of enhanced oxygen diffusion along crystal defects,
i.e. dislocations and twin boundaries, in the C15 Al 2 Ca Laves phase and how
the presence of oxygen induces structural changes at these defects. Three main
phases were identified and characterized structurally by aberration-corrected,
atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, analytically by
energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy.
Unlike the C15 bulk phase, the twin boundary and dislocation transformed into a
few nanometer wide amorphous phase, which depletes in Al and Ca but is highly
enriched in oxygen. The dislocation even shows coexistence of the amorphous
phase with a simple Al-rich A1 fcc phase. This A1 phase only depletes in Ca,
not in Al (Al remains at bulk concentration), and is also enriched in oxygen.
The Al-rich A1 phase is coherent with the C15 matrix. Electron energy loss
spectroscopy revealed the amorphous phase to be Al 2 O 3 . We thereby show as
one of the first studies that oxygen diffusion along crystal defects,
especially also at the twin boundary can induce the formation of an amorphous
oxide along themselves. The identification of oxygen-induced transformation at
strained defects has to be considered when the material is exposed to air
during plastic deformation at elevated temperatures.

MIGHTEE-HI Early Science datacubes, acquired with the MeerKAT radio telescope.
We stack galaxies in bins of galaxy properties ($M_*$, SFR, and sSFR, with
${\rm sSFR}\equiv M_*/{\rm SFR}$), obtaining $\gtrsim 5\sigma$ detections in
most cases, the strongest HI-stacking detections to date in this redshift
range. With these detections, we are able to measure scaling relations in the
probed redshift interval, finding evidence for a moderate evolution from the
median redshift of our sample $z_{\rm med}\sim 0.37$ to $z\sim 0$. In
particular, low-$M_*$ galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_*/{\rm M_\odot})\sim 9$)
experience a strong HI depletion ($\sim 0.5$ dex in $\log_{10}(M_{\rm HI}/{\rm
M}_\odot)$), while massive galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_*/{\rm M_\odot})\sim 11$)
keep their HI mass nearly unchanged. When looking at the star formation
activity, highly star-forming galaxies evolve significantly in $M_{\rm HI}$
($f_{\rm HI}$, where $f_{\rm HI}\equiv M_{\rm}/M_*$) at fixed SFR (sSFR), while
at the lowest probed SFR (sSFR) the scaling relations show no evolution. These
findings suggest a scenario in which low-$M_*$ galaxies have experienced a
strong HI depletion during the last $\sim4$ Gyr, while massive galaxies have
undergone a significant HI replenishment through some accretion mechanism,
possibly minor mergers. Interestingly, our results are in good agreement with
the predictions of the SIMBA simulation. We conclude that this work sets novel
important observational constraints on galaxy scaling relations.

understanding the impact of clinician and societal biases on ML models is
increasingly important. While biases can arise in the labels used for model
training, the many sources from which these biases arise are not yet
well-studied. In this paper, we highlight disparate censorship (i.e.,
differences in testing rates across patient groups) as a source of label bias
that clinical ML models may amplify, potentially causing harm. Many patient
risk-stratification models are trained using the results of clinician-ordered
diagnostic and laboratory tests of labels. Patients without test results are
often assigned a negative label, which assumes that untested patients do not
experience the outcome. Since orders are affected by clinical and resource
considerations, testing may not be uniform in patient populations, giving rise
to disparate censorship. Disparate censorship in patients of equivalent risk
leads to undertesting in certain groups, and in turn, more biased labels for
such groups. Using such biased labels in standard ML pipelines could contribute
to gaps in model performance across patient groups. Here, we theoretically and
empirically characterize conditions in which disparate censorship or
undertesting affect model performance across subgroups. Our findings call
attention to disparate censorship as a source of label bias in clinical ML
models.

method for right-censored outcomes. Trees in the oblique RSF are grown using
linear combinations of predictors to create branches, whereas in the standard
RSF, a single predictor is used. Oblique RSF ensembles often have higher
prediction accuracy than standard RSF ensembles. However, assessing all
possible linear combinations of predictors induces significant computational
overhead that limits applications to large-scale data sets. In addition, few
methods have been developed for interpretation of oblique RSF ensembles, and
they remain more difficult to interpret compared to their axis-based
counterparts. We introduce a method to increase computational efficiency of the
oblique RSF and a method to estimate importance of individual predictor
variables with the oblique RSF. Our strategy to reduce computational overhead
makes use of Newton-Raphson scoring, a classical optimization technique that we
apply to the Cox partial likelihood function within each non-leaf node of
decision trees. We estimate the importance of individual predictors for the
oblique RSF by negating each coefficient used for the given predictor in linear
combinations, and then computing the reduction in out-of-bag accuracy. In
general benchmarking experiments, we find that our implementation of the
oblique RSF is approximately 450 times faster with equivalent discrimination
and superior Brier score compared to existing software for oblique RSFs. We
find in simulation studies that 'negation importance' discriminates between
relevant and irrelevant predictors more reliably than permutation importance,
Shapley additive explanations, and a previously introduced technique to measure
variable importance with oblique RSFs based on analysis of variance. Methods
introduced in the current study are available in the aorsf R package.

  https://openreview.net/forum?id=LJohl5DnZf",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Training deep neural networks is a very demanding task, especially
challenging is how to adapt architectures to improve the performance of trained
models. We can find that sometimes, shallow networks generalize better than
deep networks, and the addition of more layers results in higher training and
test errors. The deep residual learning framework addresses this degradation
problem by adding skip connections to several neural network layers. It would
at first seem counter-intuitive that such skip connections are needed to train
deep networks successfully as the expressivity of a network would grow
exponentially with depth. In this paper, we first analyze the flow of
information through neural networks. We introduce and evaluate the
batch-entropy which quantifies the flow of information through each layer of a
neural network. We prove empirically and theoretically that a positive
batch-entropy is required for gradient descent-based training approaches to
optimize a given loss function successfully. Based on those insights, we
introduce batch-entropy regularization to enable gradient descent-based
training algorithms to optimize the flow of information through each hidden
layer individually. With batch-entropy regularization, gradient descent
optimizers can transform untrainable networks into trainable networks. We show
empirically that we can therefore train a ""vanilla"" fully connected network and
convolutional neural network -- no skip connections, batch normalization,
dropout, or any other architectural tweak -- with 500 layers by simply adding
the batch-entropy regularization term to the loss function. The effect of
batch-entropy regularization is not only evaluated on vanilla neural networks,
but also on residual networks, autoencoders, and also transformer models over a
wide range of computer vision as well as natural language processing tasks.

hierarchy of generality. At the first, most general level, we introduce a new
language which allows us to express various categorical structures in a
systematic and explicit manner in terms of so-called 2-schemes. Although
2-schemes can formalize categorical structures such as symmetric monoidal
categories, they are not limited to this, and can be used to define structures
with no categorical analogue. Most categorical structures come with an
effective graphical calculus such as string diagrams for symmetric monoidal
categories, and the same is true more generally for interesting 2-schemes. In
this work, we focus on one particular non-categorical 2-scheme, whose instances
we refer to as tensor types. At the second level of the hierarchy, we work out
different flavors of this 2-scheme in detail. The effective graphical calculus
of tensor types is that of tensor networks or Penrose diagrams, that is, string
diagrams without a flow of time. As such, tensor types are similar to compact
closed categories, though there are various small but potentially important
differences. Also, the two definitions use completely different mechanisms
despite both being examples of 2-schemes. At the third level of the hierarchy,
we provide a long list of different families of concrete tensor types, in a way
which makes them accessible to concrete computations, motivated by their
potential use in physics. Different tensor types describe different types of
physical models, such as classical or quantum physics, deterministic or
statistical physics, many-body or single-body physics, or matter with or
without symmetries or fermions.

customers, there are two major challenges. First, different retailers in the
retail market do not share their consumer's electricity consumption data as
these data are regarded as their assets, which has led to the problem of data
island. Second, the electricity load data are highly heterogeneous since
different retailers may serve various consumers. To this end, a fully
distributed short-term load forecasting framework based on a consensus
algorithm and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is proposed, which may protect the
customer's privacy and satisfy the accurate load forecasting requirement.
Specifically, a fully distributed learning framework is exploited for
distributed training, and a consensus technique is applied to meet confidential
privacy. Case studies show that the proposed method has comparable performance
with centralised methods regarding the accuracy, but the proposed method shows
advantages in training speed and data privacy.

Because the grid aligns with the Lidar beam, it is relatively easy to eliminate

through simulation, our proposed algorithm provides better results than
ground-plane removal, the most common existing strategy for shadow mitigation.
Unlike ground plane removal, our method applies to arbitrary terrains (e.g.
shadows on urban walls, shadows in hilly terrain) while retaining key Lidar
points on the ground that are critical for estimating changes in height, pitch,
and roll. Our preprocessing algorithm can be used with a range of scan-matching
methods; however, for voxel-based scan matching methods, it provides additional
benefits by reducing computation costs and more evenly distributing Lidar

powerful deep learning models such as transformer networks. However, instead of
designing a specialized network for movement synchrony estimation, previous
transformer-based works broadly adopted architectures from other tasks such as
human activity recognition. Therefore, this paper proposed a skeleton-based
graph transformer for movement synchrony estimation. The proposed model applied
ST-GCN, a spatial-temporal graph convolutional neural network for skeleton
feature extraction, followed by a spatial transformer for spatial feature
generation. The spatial transformer is guided by a uniquely designed joint
position embedding shared between the same joints of interacting individuals.
Besides, we incorporated a temporal similarity matrix in temporal attention
computation considering the periodic intrinsic of body movements. In addition,
the confidence score associated with each joint reflects the uncertainty of a
pose, while previous works on movement synchrony estimation have not
sufficiently emphasized this point. Since transformer networks demand a
significant amount of data to train, we constructed a dataset for movement

recognition, and pretrained our model on it using contrastive learning. We
further applied knowledge distillation to alleviate information loss introduced

involves a mixed-model repeated measure (MMRM) approach to estimate the average
treatment effect for longitudinal continuous outcome, and a generalized linear
mixed model (GLMM) approach for longitudinal binary outcome. In this paper, we
considered another estimator of the average treatment effect, called targeted
maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE). This estimator can be a one-step
alternative to model either continuous or binary outcome. We compared those
estimators by simulation studies and by analyzing real data from 28 diabetes
clinical trials. The simulations involved different missing data scenarios, and
the real data sets covered a wide range of possible distributions of the
outcome and covariates in real-life clinical trials for diabetes drugs with
different mechanisms of action. For all the settings, adjusted estimators
tended to be more efficient than the unadjusted one. In the setting of
longitudinal continuous outcome, the MMRM approach with visits and baseline
variables interaction appeared to dominate the performance of the MMRM
considering the main effects only for the baseline variables while showing
better or comparable efficiency to the TMLE estimator in both simulations and
data applications. For modeling longitudinal binary outcome, TMLE generally
outperformed GLMM in terms of relative efficiency, and its avoidance of the
cumbersome covariance fitting procedure from GLMM makes TMLE a more
advantageous estimator.

between magnons and spin chirality depends on the details of the strain such as
the spatial dependence and applied direction. Magnonic fluctuations about the
ferromagnetic state are determined, and it is found that spatially homogeneous
strains drive the magnon system into topologically protected phases. In

out-of-plane next-neighbor Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Furthermore, we
explore the application of nonuniform strains, which lead to a confinement of
magnon states that for uniaxial strains, propagates along the direction that

most conventional approaches rely on camera data from a single perspective and
therefore suffer from occlusions. We overcome this issue with our novel
multi-view 6D pose estimation method called MV6D which accurately predicts the
6D poses of all objects in a cluttered scene based on RGB-D images from
multiple perspectives. We base our approach on the PVN3D network that uses a
single RGB-D image to predict keypoints of the target objects. We extend this
approach by using a combined point cloud from multiple views and fusing the
images from each view with a DenseFusion layer. In contrast to current
multi-view pose detection networks such as CosyPose, our MV6D can learn the
fusion of multiple perspectives in an end-to-end manner and does not require
multiple prediction stages or subsequent fine tuning of the prediction.
Furthermore, we present three novel photorealistic datasets of cluttered scenes
with heavy occlusions. All of them contain RGB-D images from multiple
perspectives and the ground truth for instance semantic segmentation and 6D
pose estimation. MV6D significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in
multi-view 6D pose estimation even in cases where the camera poses are known
inaccurately. Furthermore, we show that our approach is robust towards dynamic
camera setups and that its accuracy increases incrementally with an increasing

Accepted by MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stad1445",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In asteroseismology, the surface effect refers to a disparity between the
observed and the modelled frequencies in stars with solar-like oscillations. It
originates from improper modelling of the surface layers. Correcting the
surface effect usually requires using functions with free parameters, which are
conventionally fitted to the observed frequencies. On the basis that the
correction should vary smoothly across the H--R diagram, we parameterize it as
a simple function of surface gravity, effective temperature, and metallicity.
We determine this function by fitting a wide range of stars. The absolute
amount of the surface correction decreases with luminosity, but the ratio
between it and $\nu_{\rm max}$ increases, suggesting the surface effect is more
important for red giants than dwarfs. Applying the prescription can eliminate
unrealistic surface correction, which improves parameter estimations with
stellar modelling. Using two open clusters, we found a reduction of scatter in
the model-derived ages for each star in the same cluster. As an important
application, we provide a new revision for the $\Delta\nu$ scaling relation
that, for the first time, accounts for the surface correction. The values of
the correction factor, $f_{\Delta\nu}$, are up to 2\% smaller than those
determined without the surface effect considered, suggesting decreases of up to
4\% in radii and up to 8\% in masses when using the asteroseismic scaling
relations. This revision brings the asteroseismic properties into an agreement
with those determined from eclipsing binaries. The new correction factor and
the stellar models with the corrected frequencies are available at

decoders are adapted to circuit-level noise and can be applied to surface code
volumes of arbitrary size. Their application removes errors arising from a
certain number of faults, which serves to substantially reduce the syndrome
density. Remaining errors can then be corrected by a global decoder, such as
Blossom or Union Find, with their implementation significantly accelerated due
to the reduced syndrome density. However, in the circuit-level setting, the
corrections applied by the local decoder introduce many vertical pairs of
highlighted vertices. To obtain a low syndrome density in the presence of
vertical pairs, we consider a strategy of performing a syndrome collapse which
removes many vertical pairs and reduces the size of the decoding graph used by
the global decoder. We also consider a strategy of performing a vertical
cleanup, which consists of removing all local vertical pairs prior to
implementing the global decoder. Lastly, we estimate the cost of implementing
our local decoders on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).

The formalism allows one to describe the whole walk through a pure quantum

naturally leads to the notion of system-time entanglement of the walk, which
can be considered as a measure of the number of orthogonal states visited in
the walk. We then focus on one-dimensional discrete quantum walks, where it is
shown that such entanglement is independent of the initial spin orientation for
real Hadamard-type coin operators and real initial states (in the standard
basis) with definite site parity. Moreover, in the case of an initially
localized particle it can be identified with the entanglement of the unitary
global operator that generates the whole history state, which is related to its
entangling power and can be analytically evaluated. Besides, it is shown that
the evolution of the spin subsystem can also be described through a spin
history state with an extended clock. A connection between its average
entanglement (over all initial states) and that of the operator generating this
state is also derived. A quantum circuit for generating the quantum walk
history state is provided as well.

distribution is often formulated in Euclidean spaces with zero curvature.
However, the success of the geometry constraints, posed in the embedding space,
indicates that curved spaces might encode more structural information, leading
to better discriminative power and hence richer representations. In this work,
we investigate benefits of the curved space for analyzing anomalies or
out-of-distribution objects in data. This is achieved by considering embeddings
via three geometry constraints, namely, spherical geometry (with positive
curvature), hyperbolic geometry (with negative curvature) or mixed geometry
(with both positive and negative curvatures). Three geometric constraints can
be chosen interchangeably in a unified design given the task at hand. Tailored
for the embeddings in the curved space, we also formulate functions to compute
the anomaly score. Two types of geometric modules (i.e., Geometric-in-One and
Geometric-in-Two models) are proposed to plug in the original Euclidean
classifier, and anomaly scores are computed from the curved embeddings. We
evaluate the resulting designs under a diverse set of visual recognition
scenarios, including image detection (multi-class OOD detection and one-class
anomaly detection) and segmentation (multi-class anomaly segmentation and
one-class anomaly segmentation). The empirical results show the effectiveness
of our proposal through the consistent improvement over various scenarios.

model assumes that the IBS is formed by colliding winds from a putative pulsar

radiation via synchrotron (SY) and inverse-Compton upscattering (ICS)
processes. Adopting the latest orbital solution and system geometry (Tokayer et
al. 2021), we reproduced the global X-ray and TeV LC features, two broad bumps
at $\phi \sim 0.3$ and $\sim0.7$, with the SY and ICS model components. We
found these TeV LC peaks originate from ICS emission caused by the enhanced
seed photon density near periastron and superior conjunction or Doppler-beamed
emission of bulk-accelerated particles in the IBS at inferior conjunction.
While our IBS model successfully explained most of the observed SED and LC
data, we found that phase-resolved SED data in the TeV band require an
additional component associated with ICS emission from pre-shock particles
(produced by the pulsar wind). This finding indicates a possibility of
delineating the IBS emission components and determining the bulk Lorentz
factors of the pulsar wind at certain orbital phases.

The process makes use of the natural tendency for BCP mixtures to form
nanoscale structures upon phase separation. The phase separation can be
directed through the use of chemically patterned substrates to promote the
formation of morphologies that are essential to the production of semiconductor
devices. Moreover, the design of substrate pattern can formulated as an
optimization problem for which we seek optimal substrate designs that
effectively produce given target morphologies.
  In this paper, we adopt a phase field model given by a nonlocal
Cahn--Hilliard partial differential equation (PDE) based on the minimization of
the Ohta--Kawasaki free energy, and present an efficient PDE-constrained
optimization framework for the optimal design problem. The design variables are
the locations of circular- or strip-shaped guiding posts that are used to model
the substrate chemical pattern. To solve the ensuing optimization problem, we
propose a variant of an inexact Newton conjugate gradient algorithm tailored to
this problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our computational strategy on
numerical examples that span a range of target morphologies. Owing to our
second-order optimizer and fast state solver, the numerical results demonstrate
five orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost over previous work.
The efficiency of our framework and the fast convergence of our optimization

  Unsupervised Domain Adaptation","Accepted at ACMMM 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Extensive studies on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) have propelled the
deployment of deep learning from limited experimental datasets into real-world
unconstrained domains. Most UDA approaches align features within a common
embedding space and apply a shared classifier for target prediction. However,
since a perfectly aligned feature space may not exist when the domain
discrepancy is large, these methods suffer from two limitations. First, the
coercive domain alignment deteriorates target domain discriminability due to
lacking target label supervision. Second, the source-supervised classifier is
inevitably biased to source data, thus it may underperform in target domain. To
alleviate these issues, we propose to simultaneously conduct feature alignment
in two individual spaces focusing on different domains, and create for each
space a domain-oriented classifier tailored specifically for that domain.
Specifically, we design a Domain-Oriented Transformer (DOT) that has two
individual classification tokens to learn different domain-oriented
representations, and two classifiers to preserve domain-wise discriminability.
Theoretical guaranteed contrastive-based alignment and the source-guided
pseudo-label refinement strategy are utilized to explore both domain-invariant
and specific information. Comprehensive experiments validate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art on several benchmarks.

elements can be sampled from some distribution $P$, and that when an element
$x$ is sampled, the probability $P$ of sampling $x$ is also known. Recent work
in distribution testing has shown that many algorithms are robust in the sense
that they still produce correct output if the elements are drawn from any
distribution $Q$ that is sufficiently close to $P$. This phenomenon raises
interesting questions: under what conditions is a ""noisy"" distribution $Q$
sufficient, and what is the algorithmic cost of coping with this noise?
  We investigate these questions for the problem of estimating the sum of a
multiset of $N$ real values $x_1, \ldots, x_N$. This problem is well-studied in
the statistical literature in the case $P = Q$, where the Hansen-Hurwitz
estimator is frequently used. We assume that for some known distribution $P$,
values are sampled from a distribution $Q$ that is pointwise close to $P$. For
every positive integer $k$ we define an estimator $\zeta_k$ for $\mu = \sum_i
x_i$ whose bias is proportional to $\gamma^k$ (where our $\zeta_1$ reduces to
the classical Hansen-Hurwitz estimator). As a special case, we show that if $Q$
is pointwise $\gamma$-close to uniform and all $x_i \in \{0, 1\}$, for any
$\epsilon > 0$, we can estimate $\mu$ to within additive error $\epsilon N$
using $m = \Theta({N^{1-\frac{1}{k}} / \epsilon^{2/k}})$ samples, where $k =
\left\lceil (\log \epsilon)/(\log \gamma)\right\rceil$. We show that this
sample complexity is essentially optimal. Our bounds show that the sample
complexity need not vary uniformly with the desired error parameter $\epsilon$:
for some values of $\epsilon$, perturbations in its value have no asymptotic
effect on the sample complexity, while for other values, any decrease in its
value results in an asymptotically larger sample complexity.

fusion MVC via alignment maximization to address these issues. To do so, we
first reveal the theoretical connection of existing k-means clustering and the
alignment between base partitions and the consensus one. Based on this
observation, we propose a simple but effective multi-view algorithm termed
LF-MVC-GAM. It optimally fuses multiple source information in partition level
from each individual view, and maximally aligns the consensus partition with
these weighted base ones. Such an alignment is beneficial to integrate
partition level information and significantly reduce the computational
complexity by sufficiently simplifying the optimization procedure. We then
design another variant, LF-MVC-LAM to further improve the clustering
performance by preserving the local intrinsic structure among multiple
partition spaces. After that, we develop two three-step iterative algorithms to
solve the resultant optimization problems with theoretically guaranteed
convergence. Further, we provide the generalization error bound analysis of the

management, decision-making, and collaboration. In contrast, routine
inter-employee communication patterns within workplaces tend to emerge more
naturally, as a consequence of both supervisory relationships and the needs of
the organization. Scholars of organizational management have proposed theories
relating organizational trees to communication dynamics and measures of
business performance. Separately, network scientists have studied the
topological structure of communication patterns in different types of
organizations. However, the nature of the relationship between a formal
organizational structure and emergent communications between employees remains
unclear. In this paper, we study associations between organizational hierarchy
and communication dynamics among approximately 200,000 employees of a large
software company in May 2019. We propose new measures of communication
reciprocity and new shortest-path distances for trees to characterize the
frequency of messages passed up, down, and across the organizational hierarchy.
By dividing the organization into 88 teams -- organizational trees rooted at
the senior leadership level -- we identify distinct communication network
structures within and between teams. These structures are related to the
function of these teams within the company, including sales, marketing,
engineering, and research. We discuss the relationship of routine employee
communication patterns to supervisory hierarchies in this company, and
empirically evaluate several theories of organizational management and
performance.

unknown medium is probed with pulses and the time domain pressure waveform data

used for efficient velocity estimation. While the conventional FWI via
nonlinear least-squares data fitting is challenging without low frequency
information, and prone to getting stuck in local minima (cycle skipping),
minimization of ROM misfit is behaved much better, even for a poor initial
guess. For low-dimensional parametrizations of the unknown velocity the ROM
misfit function is close to convex. The proposed approach consistently
outperforms conventional FWI in standard synthetic tests.

widely studied as the potential approach to ensure the safety of autonomous
driving. Vehicles in the form of platoon adopt 802.11p to exchange messages
through vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications. When multiple platoons arrive
at an intersection, the leader vehicle of each platoon adjusts its movement
characteristics to ensure that it can cross the intersection and thus the
following vehicles have to adjust their movement characteristics accordingly.
In this case, the time-varying connectivity among vehicles leads to the
significant non-stationary performance change in platooning communications,
which may incur safety issues. In this paper, we construct the time-dependent
model to evaluate the platooning communication performance at the intersection
based on the initial movement characteristics. We first consider the movement
behaviors of vehicles at the intersection including turning, accelerating,
decelerating and stopping as well as the periodic change of traffic lights to
construct movement model, and then establish a hearing network to reflect the
time-varying connectivity among vehicles. Afterwards, we adopt the pointwise
stationary fluid flow approximation (PSFFA) to model the non-stationary
behavior of transmission queue. Then, we consider four access categories (ACs)
and continuous backoff freezing of 802.11p to construct the models to describe
the time-dependent access process of 802.11p. Finally, based on the
time-dependent model, the packet transmission delay and packet delivery ratio
are derived. The accuracy of our proposed model is verified by comparing the
simulation results with analytical results.

good performance, and showing that different subbands have different
contributions to audio deepfake detection. However, this lacks an explanation
of the specific information in the subband, and these features also lose
information such as phase. Inspired by the mechanism of synthetic speech, the
fundamental frequency (F0) information is used to improve the quality of
synthetic speech, while the F0 of synthetic speech is still too average, which
differs significantly from that of real speech. It is expected that F0 can be
used as important information to discriminate between bonafide and fake speech,
while this information cannot be used directly due to the irregular
distribution of F0. Insteadly, the frequency band containing most of F0 is
selected as the input feature. Meanwhile, to make full use of the phase and
full-band information, we also propose to use real and imaginary spectrogram
features as complementary input features and model the disjoint subbands
separately. Finally, the results of F0, real and imaginary spectrogram features
are fused. Experimental results on the ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset show that our

the NISQ era. In the workflow of VQA, the parameters of ansatz are iteratively
updated to approximate the desired quantum states. We have seen various efforts
to draft better ansatz with less gates. In quantum computers, the gate ansatz
will eventually be transformed into control signals such as microwave pulses on
transmons. And the control pulses need elaborate calibration to minimize the
errors such as over-rotation and under-rotation. In the case of VQAs, this
procedure will introduce redundancy, but the variational properties of VQAs can
naturally handle problems of over-rotation and under-rotation by updating the
amplitude and frequency parameters. Therefore, we propose PAN, a native-pulse
ansatz generator framework for VQAs. We generate native-pulse ansatz with
trainable parameters for amplitudes and frequencies. In our proposed PAN, we
are tuning parametric pulses, which are natively supported on NISQ computers.
Considering that parameter-shift rules do not hold for native-pulse ansatz, we
need to deploy non-gradient optimizers. To constrain the number of parameters
sent to the optimizer, we adopt a progressive way to generate our native-pulse
ansatz. Experiments are conducted on both simulators and quantum devices to
validate our methods. When adopted on NISQ machines, PAN obtained improved the

until 1000 years after the first protostar formation. Instead of the sink
particle technique, we employ a stiff equation of state approach to represent
the magnetic field structure connecting to protostars. Ten years after the
first protostar formation in the cloud initialized with $B_0 = 10^{-20}$ G at
$n_0 = 10^4\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$, the magnetic field strength around protostars
amplifies from pico- to kilo-gauss, which is the same strength as the
present-day star. The magnetic field rapidly winds up since the gas in the
vicinity of the protostar ($\leq\!10$ au) has undergone several tens orbital
rotations in the first decade after protostar formation. As the mass accretion
progresses, the vital magnetic field region extends outward, and the magnetic
braking eliminates fragmentation of the disk that would form in the
unmagnetized model. On the other hand, assuming a gas cloud with small angular
momentum, this amplification might not work because the rotation would be
slower. However, disk fragmentation would not occur in that case. We conclude
that the exponential amplification of the cosmological magnetic field strength,
about $10^{-18}$ G, eliminates disk fragmentation around the Population III
protostars.

zero-touch service management in the field of networks and computing,
intent-driven service management (IDSM) has been proposed as a response to
stringent quality of service requirements. In IDSM, users express their service
requirements in a declarative manner as intents. IDSM, with the help of closed

to meet service request requirements. The result is a faster deployment of
Internet services and reduction in configuration errors caused by manual
operations, which in turn reduces the service-level agreement (SLA) violations.
In the early stages of development, IDSM systems require attention from

vehicular users. Since user data usually contains privacy information, users
are reluctant to share their data with others. To solve this problem,
traditional federated learning (FL) needs to update the global model
synchronously through aggregating all users' local models to protect users'
privacy. However, vehicles may frequently drive out of the coverage area of the
VEC before they achieve their local model trainings and thus the local models
cannot be uploaded as expected, which would reduce the accuracy of the global

popular contents are diverse, thus the size of the predicted popular contents

cache the predicted popular contents in different RSUs while considering the

incompleteness of quantum mechanics based on the premise of local realism. The
general viewpoint is that the argument is compromised, because local realism is
falsifiable by Bell or Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) experiments. In this
paper, we challenge this conclusion, by presenting alternative versions of the
EPR paradox based on premises not falsifiable by the GHZ and Bell predictions.
First, we explain how the Bohm-EPR and GHZ paradoxes can be demonstrated using
macroscopic spins $S_\theta$ formed from qubits realized as two macroscopically
distinct states. This establishes an 'all or nothing' incompatibility between
quantum mechanics and macroscopic realism (MR). However, we note different
definitions of MR. For a system in a superposition of two macroscopically
distinct eigenstates of $S_\theta$, MR posits a definite value for the outcome
of $S_\theta$. Deterministic macroscopic realism (dMR) posits MR regardless of
whether the interaction $U_\theta$ determining the measurement setting $\theta$
has occurred. In contrast, the weaker assumption, weak macroscopic realism
(wMR), posits MR for the system prepared after $U_\theta$. We show that the GHZ
paradox negates dMR but is consistent with wMR. Yet, we show that a Bohm-EPR
paradox for the incompleteness of quantum mechanics arises based on either form
of MR. Since wMR is not falsified, this raises the question of how to interpret
the EPR paradox. We revisit the original EPR paradox and find a similar result:
The EPR argument can be based on a contextual version of local realism (wLR)
not falsifiable by Bell or GHZ experiments. The premises wLR and wMR posit
realism and no-disturbance for systems prepared with respect to a pointer basis
(after $U_\theta$), leading to further predictions giving consistency with
quantum mechanics.

discoveries over the past decade. These include the observation of a flux of
TeV-PeV astrophysical neutrinos, detection of the first astrophysical neutrino
on the Glashow resonance and evidence of the blazar TXS 0506+056 as the first
known astronomical source of high-energy neutrinos. Several questions, however,
remain, pertaining to the precise origins of astrophysical neutrinos, their
production mechanisms at the source and in Earth's atmosphere and in the
context of physics beyond the Standard Model. This proceeding highlights some
of our latest results, from new constraints on neutrino interactions and
oscillations to the latest measurements of the astrophysical neutrino flux and
searches for their origins to future prospects with IceCube-Gen2.

range of military and civilian applications including rescue, wild life

significantly affect the localization precision. The existing sensor placement
strategies mainly work on the cases without any constraints on the sensors
locations. However, UAVs cannot fly/hover simply in arbitrary region due to
realistic constraints, such as the geographical limitations, the security
issues, and the max flying speed. In this paper, optimal geometrical
configurations of UAVs in received signal strength (RSS)-based localization
under region constraints are investigated. Employing the D-optimal criteria,
i.e., minimizing the determinate of Fisher information matrix (FIM), such
optimal problem is formulated. Based on the rigorous algebra and geometrical
derivations, optimal and also closed form configurations of UAVs under
different flying states are proposed. Finally, the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed configurations are demonstrated by simulation
examples.

While for the Im$V_{Q\bar{Q}}$ , we observe that by considering the effect of

quarkonium dissociation, while rapidity has opposite effect. In particular, as
the value of GC decreases in the deconfined phase, the Im$V_{Q\bar{Q}}$ is
generated for smaller distance thus enhancing quarkonium dissociation, and at
high temperatures it is nearly not modified by GC, consistent with previous
findings of the entropic force.

applications through caching the contents in the roadside units (RSUs), thus
vehicles can fetch the contents requested by vehicular users (VUs) from the RSU
within short time. The capacity of the RSU is limited and the contents
requested by VUs change frequently due to the high-mobility characteristics of
vehicles, thus it is essential to predict the most popular contents and cache
them in the RSU in advance. The RSU can train model based on the VUs' data to
effectively predict the popular contents. However, VUs are often reluctant to
share their data with others due to the personal privacy. Federated learning
(FL) allows each vehicle to train the local model based on VUs' data, and
upload the local model to the RSU instead of data to update the global model,
and thus VUs' privacy information can be protected. The traditional synchronous
FL must wait all vehicles to complete training and upload their local models
for global model updating, which would cause a long time to train global model.
The asynchronous FL updates the global model in time once a vehicle's local
model is received. However, the vehicles with different staying time have
different impacts to achieve the accurate global model. In this paper, we
consider the vehicle mobility and propose an Asynchronous FL based
Mobility-aware Edge Caching (AFMC) scheme to obtain an accurate global model,
and then propose an algorithm to predict the popular contents based on the
global model. Experimental results show that AFMC outperforms other baseline
caching schemes.

  Outcome-Dependent Sampling","43 pages, 1 figure",,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Unmeasured confounding and selection bias are often of concern in
observational studies and may invalidate a causal analysis if not appropriately
accounted for. Under outcome-dependent sampling, a latent factor that has
causal effects on the treatment, outcome, and sample selection process may
cause both unmeasured confounding and selection bias, rendering standard causal
parameters unidentifiable without additional assumptions. Under an odds ratio
model for the treatment effect, Li et al. 2022 established both proximal
identification and estimation of causal effects by leveraging a pair of
negative control variables as proxies of latent factors at the source of both
confounding and selection bias. However, their approach relies exclusively on
the existence and correct specification of a so-called treatment confounding
bridge function, a model that restricts the treatment assignment mechanism. In
this article, we propose doubly robust estimation under the odds ratio model
with respect to two nuisance functions -- a treatment confounding bridge
function and an outcome confounding bridge function that restricts the outcome
law, such that our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal if either
bridge function model is correctly specified, without knowing which one is.
Thus, our proposed doubly robust estimator is potentially more robust than that
of Li et al. 2022. Our simulations confirm that the proposed proximal
estimators of an odds ratio causal effect can adequately account for both
residual confounding and selection bias under stated conditions with
well-calibrated confidence intervals in a wide range of scenarios, where
standard methods generally fail to be consistent. In addition, the proposed
doubly robust estimator is consistent if at least one confounding bridge
function is correctly specified.

to discretize the joint rings into multiple nodes and edges for contact

of the numerical model. In order to achieve the non-deviation condition between
sliding ring and flexible rod, a novel barrier functional is derived based on
incremental potential theory, and the tangent frictional interplay is later
procured by a lagged dissipative formulation. The proposed barrier functional
and the associated frictional functional are $C^{2}$ continuous, hence the
nonlinear elastodynamic system can be solved variationally by an implicit
time-stepping scheme. The numerical framework is first applied to simple
examples where the analytical solutions are available for validation. Then,
multiple complex practical engineering examples are considered to showcase the

also important to compare the performance of gaze input to touch input.
  In this study, we conducted ISO 9241-9 Fitts' Law evaluation to compare the
performance of multimodal gaze and foot-based input to touch input in a
standard desktop environment, while using mouse input as the baseline. From a
study involving 12 participants, we found that the gaze input has the lowest
throughput (2.55 bits/s), and the highest movement time (1.04 s) of the three
inputs. In addition, though touch input involves maximum physical movements, it
achieved the highest throughput (6.67 bits/s), the least movement time (0.5 s),
and was the most preferred input. While there are similarities in how quickly
pointing can be moved from source to target location when using both gaze and
touch inputs, target selection consumes maximum time with gaze input. Hence,
with a throughput that is over 160% higher than gaze, touch proves to be a

report the discovery of the third binary known of this kind: it consists of a
hot subdwarf O (sdO) star and a WD with an orbital period of 3.495 hours and an
orbital shrinkage of 0.1 s in 6 yr. The sdO star overfills its Roche lobe and
likely transfers mass to the WD via an accretion disk. From spectroscopy, we

The origin of this binary is probably a common envelope ejection channel, where
the progenitor of the sdO star is either an RGB star or, more likely, an early
AGB star; the sdO star will subsequently evolve into a WD and merge with its WD
companion, likely resulting in an R CrB star. The outstanding feature in the
spectrum of this object is strong Ca H&K lines, which are blueshifted by
$\sim$200 km/s and likely originate from the recently ejected common envelope,

computationally intensive neural network architectures. Most of these methods
are not adaptable to high-resolution image segmentation due to memory and other
computational issues. Typical approaches in literature involve design of neural
network architectures that can fuse global information from low-resolution
images and local information from the high-resolution counterparts. However,
architectures designed for processing high resolution images are unnecessarily
complex and involve a lot of hyper parameters that can be difficult to tune.
Also, most of these architectures require ground truth annotations of the high
resolution images to train, which can be hard to obtain. In this article, we
develop a robust pipeline based on mathematical morphological (MM) operators
that can seamlessly extend any existing semantic segmentation algorithm to high
resolution images. Our method does not require the ground truth annotations of
the high resolution images. It is based on efficiently utilizing information
from the low-resolution counterparts, and gradient information on the
high-resolution images. We obtain high quality seeds from the inferred labels
on low-resolution images using traditional morphological operators and
propagate seed labels using a random walker to refine the semantic labels at
the boundaries. We show that the semantic segmentation results obtained by our
method beat the existing state-of-the-art algorithms on high-resolution images.
We empirically prove the robustness of our approach to the hyper parameters
used in our pipeline. Further, we characterize some necessary conditions under
which our pipeline is applicable and provide an in-depth analysis of the
proposed approach.

demonstrated that excess entropy scaling holds for both fine-grained and

exact determination of the scaling relationship was not possible due to the
semi-empirical nature. In this second paper, an analytical excess entropy
scaling relation is derived for bottom-up CG systems. At the single-site CG
resolution, effective hard sphere systems are constructed that yield
near-identical dynamical properties as the target CG systems by taking
advantage of how hard sphere dynamics and excess entropy can be analytically
expressed in terms of the liquid packing fraction. Inspired by classical
equilibrium perturbation theories and recent advances in constructing hard
sphere models for predicting activated dynamics of supercooled liquids, we
propose a new approach for understanding the diffusion of molecular liquids in
the normal regime using hard sphere reference fluids. The proposed ""fluctuation
matching"" is designed to have the same amplitude of long wavelength density
fluctuations (dimensionless compressibility) as the CG system. Utilizing the
Enskog theory to derive an expression for hard sphere diffusion coefficients, a
bridge between the CG dynamics and excess entropy is then established. The CG
diffusion coefficient can be roughly estimated using various equations of the
state, and an accurate prediction of accelerated CG dynamics at different
temperatures is also possible in advance of running any CG simulation. By
introducing another layer of coarsening, these findings provide a more rigorous
method to assess excess entropy scaling and understand the accelerated CG
dynamics of molecular fluids.

numbers are studied for three-dimensional perturbations. In addition to the
Tollmien-Schlichting modes, there exist higher modes in a channel flow that do
not have a counterpart in the incompressible limit. The stability
characteristics of these higher modes, obtained through numerical calculations,
are compared with boundary layer and Couette flows that have been previously
studied. The dominant higher mode instabilities in a channel flow are shown to
be viscous in nature, in contrast to compressible boundary layer modes. For
general compressible bounded-domain flows, a necessary condition for the
existence of neutral modes in the inviscid limit is obtained. This criterion is
used to construct a procedure to determine a critical value of Mach number
below which the higher modes remain stable. This criterion also delineates a
range of angles of inclination of the wave number with respect to the flow
direction which could go unstable at a specified Mach number. Asymptotic
analysis is carried out for the lower and upper branch of the stability curve
in the limit of high Reynolds number. A common set of relations are identified
for these exponents for the upper and lower branch for the continuation of the
Tollmien-Schlichting modes and the compressible modes. The scalings for the
Tollmien-Schlichting modes are identical to those for an incompressible flow.
The scalings for the finite wave number modes are different; the wave speed $c$
scales as $\mbox{Re}^{-\frac{1}{3}}$ for the lower branch and
$\mbox{Re}^{-\frac{1}{5}}$ for the upper branch, where $\mbox{Re}$ is the
Reynolds number. The asymptotic analysis shows that the stability boundaries
for three-dimensional perturbations at high Reynolds numbers can be calculated
from the strain rate and the temperature of the base flow at the wall.

based on the bonds' classification. This classification of bonds is performed
on the basis of the equivalent hypothetical local strains and falls into three
categories of horizontal normal, vertical normal, and shear bonds. While the
classical Bond-Based PD (BB-PD) considers only the stretch of bonds, all
components of the bonds' strains are taken into account in the proposed model.A
local imaginary element is considered around each bond to estimate the true
strains of each bond. The constitutive relations are derived from equating the
strain energies of the bonds' deformations to the Classical Continuum Mechanics
(CCM) strain energies for a generalized combined loading condition. A novel
critical stretch criterion and critical angle criterion are proposed to predict
the failure of normal and shear strain bonds, respectively.It is also shown
that, unlike the classical BB-PD, the proposed model does not impose any
limitations on the value of Poisson's ratio. The model is verified by
investigating some intact plane stress and plane strain problems under
mechanical and thermal loadings. Moreover, the deformation and damage contours
and the corresponding stress-strain responses are presented for different
problems with pre-existing defects and validated with the eXtended Finite
Element method's (XFEM) analysis.

preserve the signed distance property, which is a desirable property for the
level set function representing a moving interface. Therefore, reinitialization
or redistancing methods are frequently applied to restore the signed distance
property while keeping the zero-contour fixed. As an alternative approach to
these methods, we introduce a modified level set advection equation that
intrinsically preserves the norm of the gradient at the interface, i.e. the
local signed distance property. Mathematically, this is achieved by introducing
a carefully chosen source term being proportional to the local rate of
interfacial area generation. The introduction of the source term turns the
problem into a non-linear one. However, we show that by discretizing the source
term explicitly in time, it is sufficient to solve a linear equation in each
time step. Notably, without further adjustment, the method works in the case of
a moving contact line. This is a major advantage since redistancing is known to
be an issue when contact lines are involved. We provide a first implementation

physical adsorption to construct van der Waals heterojunctions and that two van

electric field energy is expressed in the outer circuit when the circuit is

only has the effect of the surface state function G, which produces a smaller

four cases with different ambient temperatures were considered in the climate

they could be used as the input conditions for the simulation and to ensure the
analysis of the icing process was based on the characteristics of the snow.
Both qualitative and quantitative data were obtained, whereby photographs was
used for qualitative analysis, and the density of the snow sample and the
thickness of snow accreted on the model were used for quantitative analysis.
Based on the visual observations, it was deduced that as the ambient
temperature increased, the range of the snow accreted was broader. The
thickness of snow accreted on the model nose was the largest on the upper and
lower part at -3 oC, and on the middle part at -5 oC. Additionally, the cross
section of snow accreted was observed to be trench-like. Similar icing

pin-checking are also implemented, compared, and a successful method is shown.
The set-up is performed automatically, with two novel contributions. A deep
learning segmentation of the pins is performed and the inspection pose is found
by simulation. From the inspection pose and the segmented pins, the templates
for pose estimation and pin check are then generated. To train the deep
learning method a dataset of segmented through-hole components is created. The
network shows a 97.3 % accuracy on the test set. The pin-segmentation network
is also tested on the insertion CAD models and successfully segment the pins.
The complete system is tested on three different objects, and experiments show
that the system is able to insert all objects successfully. Both by correcting
in-hand grasp errors and rejecting objects with bent pins.

  Network Energy","5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables",,,,"cs.MA cs.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reducing energy consumption is crucial to reduce the human debt's with regard
to our planet. Therefore most companies try to reduce their energetic
consumption while taking care to preserve the service delivered to their
customers. To do so, a service provider (SP) typically downscale or shutdown
part of its infrastructure in periods of low-activity where only few customers
need the service. However an SP still needs to maintain part of its
infrastructure ""on"", which still requires significant energy. For example a
mobile national operator (MNO) needs to maintain most of its radio access
network (RAN) active. Could an SP do better by cooperating with other SPs who
would temporarily support its users, thus allowing it to temporarily shut down
its infrastructure, and then reciprocate during another low-activity period? To
answer this question, we investigated a novel collaboration framework based on
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) allowing negotiations between SPs as
well as trustful reports from a distributed ledger technology (DLT) to evaluate
the amount of energy being saved. We leveraged it to experiment three different
sets of rules (free, recommended, or imposed) regulating the negotiation
between multiple SPs (3, 4, 8, or 10). With respect to four cooperation metrics
(efficiency, safety, incentive-compatibility, and fairness), the simulations
showed that the imposed set of rules proved to be the best mode.

break the translational symmetry of graphene and couple electrons of the two

intermediate renderings that not only exhibit smooth transitions between the

Multiview Regenerative Morphing that formulates the morphing process as an
optimization to solve for rigid transformation and optimal-transport
interpolation. Given the multiview input images of the source and target
scenes, we first learn a volumetric representation that models the geometry and
appearance for each scene to enable the rendering of novel views. Then, the
morphing between the two scenes is obtained by solving optimal transport
between the two volumetric representations in Wasserstein metrics. Our approach
does not rely on user-specified correspondences or 2D/3D input meshes, and we
do not assume any predefined categories of the source and target scenes. The
proposed view-consistent interpolation scheme directly works on multiview

that bilayer ZZ edges undergo edge reconstruction and so acquire closed,

closed bilayer ZZ edge and its high stability against e-beam irradiation are
confirmed by first-principles calculations. Moreover, we fabricate bilayer

autoencoders to optimal fault detection in nonlinear dynamic systems.
Autoencoder-based learning is a standard machine learning method and widely
applied for fault (anomaly) detection and classification. In the context of
representation learning, the so-called latent (hidden) variable plays an
important role towards an optimal fault detection. In ideal case, the latent
variable should be a minimal sufficient statistic. The existing
autoencoder-based fault detection schemes are mainly application-oriented, and
few efforts have been devoted to optimal autoencoder-based fault detection and
explainable applications. The main objective of our work is to establish a
framework for learning autoencoder-based optimal fault detection in nonlinear
dynamic systems. To this aim, a process model form for dynamic systems is
firstly introduced with the aid of control theory, which also leads to a clear
system interpretation of the latent variable. The major efforts are made on the
development of a control theoretic solution to the optimal fault detection
problem, in which an analog concept to minimal sufficient statistic, the
so-called lossless information compression, is introduced and proven for
dynamic systems and fault detection specifications. In particular, the
existence conditions for such a latent variable are derived, based on which a
loss function and further a learning algorithm are developed. This learning
algorithm enables optimally training of autoencoders to achieve an optimal
fault detection in nonlinear dynamic systems. A case study on three-tank system
is given at the end of this paper to illustrate the capability of the proposed
autoencoder-based fault detection and to explain the essential role of the
latent variable in the proposed fault detection system.

by an energy source that generates an angle-dependent torque. Examples of such

and the Brownian gyrating engine. Variations in the torque are averaged out by
the inertia of the system to produce limit cycle oscillations. While torque
generating mechanisms are also ubiquitous in the biological world, where they
typically feed on chemical gradients, inertia is not a property that one
naturally associates with such processes. In the present work, seeking ways to
dispense of the need for inertial effects, we study an inertia-less concept
where the combined effect of coupled torque-producing components averages out
variations in the ambient potential and helps overcome dissipative forces to
allow sustained operation for vanishingly small inertia. We exemplify this
inertia-less concept through analysis of two of the aforementioned engines, the
Stirling engine and the Brownian gyrating engine. An analogous principle may be
sought in biomolecular processes as well as in modern-day technological
engines, where for the latter, the coupled torque-producing components reduce

contains not only new UV poles but also IR poles. While the UV poles bring new
quantum corrections (in the form of counterterms), finite or divergent, that we
compute, it is shown that the IR poles do not bring new physics. The IR quantum
corrections, both finite and divergent, cancel out similarly to the way the IR
poles themselves cancel in the traditional approach to IR divergences (in the
cross section, after summing over virtual and real corrections). Hence, the

selection (CSFS) methods use one-versus-all split of the data set that leads to
issues such as class imbalance, decision aggregation, and high computational

fuzzy rule-based classifier, which is free from the drawbacks associated with
most existing class-specific methods. Additionally, our method can be adapted
to control the level of redundancy in the class-specific feature subsets by
adding a suitable regularizer to the learning objective. Our method results in
class-specific rules involving class-specific subsets. We also propose an
extension where different rules of a particular class are defined by different
feature subsets to model different substructures within the class. The
effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated through experiments on
three synthetic data sets.

Detailed morphological classifications of the calibration galaxy sample with

previously overlooked human poses, to implement the prediction task from the

privileged sequence to interpolate the in-between predicted sequence, wherein
the embedded Privileged-sequence-Encoder (Priv-Encoder) learns the privileged

equipped with a novel PK-Simulator that distills PK learned from the previous

various natural language and vision tasks. As a default component in
Transformers, Layer Normalization (LN) normalizes activations within each token
to boost the robustness. However, LN requires on-the-fly statistics calculation
in inference as well as division and square root operations, leading to
inefficiency on hardware. What is more, replacing LN with other
hardware-efficient normalization schemes (e.g., Batch Normalization) results in
inferior performance, even collapse in training. We find that this dilemma is
caused by abnormal behaviors of activation statistics, including large
fluctuations over iterations and extreme outliers across layers. To tackle
these issues, we propose Unified Normalization (UN), which can speed up the
inference by being fused with other linear operations and achieve comparable
performance on par with LN. UN strives to boost performance by calibrating the
activation and gradient statistics with a tailored fluctuation smoothing
strategy. Meanwhile, an adaptive outlier filtration strategy is applied to
avoid collapse in training whose effectiveness is theoretically proved and
experimentally verified in this paper. We demonstrate that UN can be an
efficient drop-in alternative to LN by conducting extensive experiments on
language and vision tasks. Besides, we evaluate the efficiency of our method on

tasks in biomedical text mining, which involves two kinds of information:
entity relations and entity functions. One feasible approach is to take
relation extraction and function detection as two independent sub-tasks.
However, this separate learning method ignores the intrinsic correlation
between them and leads to unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose
a joint learning model, which combines entity relation extraction and entity
function detection to exploit their commonality and capture their
inter-relationship, so as to improve the performance of biomedical causal
relation extraction. Meanwhile, during the model training stage, different
function types in the loss function are assigned different weights.
Specifically, the penalty coefficient for negative function instances increases
to effectively improve the precision of function detection. Experimental
results on the BioCreative-V Track 4 corpus show that our joint learning model
outperforms the separate models in BEL statement extraction, achieving the F1
scores of 58.4% and 37.3% on the test set in Stage 2 and Stage 1 evaluations,

[Objective] This work aims at understanding how feature knowledge is documented
in GitHub projects and how it is linked (if at all) to the source code.
[Method] We conducted an in-depth qualitative exploratory content analysis of
25 popular GitHub repositories that provided the documentation artefacts
recommended by GitHub's Community Standards indicator. We first extracted
strategies used to document software features in textual artefacts and then
strategies used to link the feature documentation with source code. [Results]
We observed feature documentation in all studied projects in artefacts such as
READMEs, wikis, and website resource files. However, the features were often
described in an unstructured way. Additionally, tracing techniques to connect
feature documentation and source code were rarely used. [Conclusions] Our
results suggest a lacking (or a low-prioritised) feature documentation in
open-source projects, little use of normalised structures, and a rare explicit
referencing to source code. As a result, product feature traceability is likely
to be very limited, and maintainability to suffer over time.

Fe$^{2+}$ ions have the same level sequence and ground-state configuration

produces strong AF couplings, and the $(3z^2-r^2)/(xz,yz)$ mixing via the

anisotropy. Indeed, by tracing a set of different spin-orbital states, our

Existing work separates imputation method and prediction model as two
independent parts of an EHR-based machine learning system. We propose an
integrated end-to-end approach by utilizing a Compound Density Network (CDNet)
that allows the imputation method and prediction model to be tuned together
within a single framework. CDNet consists of a Gated recurrent unit (GRU), a
Mixture Density Network (MDN), and a Regularized Attention Network (RAN). The
GRU is used as a latent variable model to model EHR data. The MDN is designed
to sample latent variables generated by GRU. The RAN serves as a regularizer
for less reliable imputed values. The architecture of CDNet enables GRU and MDN
to iteratively leverage the output of each other to impute missing values,
leading to a more accurate and robust prediction. We validate CDNet on the
mortality prediction task on the MIMIC-III dataset. Our model outperforms
state-of-the-art models by significant margins. We also empirically show that
regularizing imputed values is a key factor for superior prediction
performance. Analysis of prediction uncertainty shows that our model can
capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, which offers model users a
better understanding of the model results.

developing tests with mocks. In this paper, we propose to monitor an
application in production to generate tests that mimic realistic execution
scenarios through mocks. Our approach operates in three phases. First, we
instrument a set of target methods for which we want to generate tests, as well
as the methods that they invoke, which we refer to mockable method calls.
Second, in production, we collect data about the context in which target
methods are invoked, as well as the parameters and the returned value for each
mockable method call. Third, offline, we analyze the production data to
generate test cases with realistic inputs and mock interactions. The approach
is automated and implemented in an open-source tool called RICK. We evaluate
our approach with three real-world, open-source Java applications. RICK
monitors the invocation of 128 methods in production across the three
applications and captures their behavior. Next, RICK analyzes the production
observations in order to generate test cases that include rich initial states
and test inputs, mocks and stubs that recreate actual interactions between the
method and its environment, as well as mock-based oracles. All the test cases
are executable, and 52.4% of them successfully mimic the complete execution

they can be detected in completely different timescales. As the detection of
first particle leads to collapse of the wave function, there is no a
straightforward and agreed method to study this problem in the orthodox
formalism which lacks a clear prediction of these random events and therefore
the quantum state afterwards. This is not the case in Bohmian framework which
we implement in this paper and we can predict the system up to the end of
experiment. The main result is the joint distribution of detection data
including the arrival time and position of the particles on left and right

distribution can be affected by a change to the relative location of screens,
the marginals on each side remain intact compatible with signal-locality. At
the end, we see how this result is very sensitive to quantum equilibrium

strong ro-vibrational coupling to a quantized optical cavity mode in thermal
equilibrium is presented. Theoretical challenges in describing strongly coupled
systems of mixed quantum statistics (Bosons and Fermions) are discussed and
circumvented by the specific choice of our molecular system. Our exact
simulations reveal the absence of a zero temperature for the strongly coupled
matter and light subsystems, due to cavity induced non-equilibrium conditions.
Furthermore, we explore the temperature dependency of light-matter quantum
entanglement, which emerges for the groundstate, but is quickly lost already in
the deep cryogenic regime, opposing predictions from phenomenological models
(Jaynes-Cummings). Distillable molecular light-matter entanglement of
ro-vibrational states may open interesting perspectives for quantum
technological applications. Moreover, we find that the dynamics (fluctuations)
of matter remains modified by the quantum nature of the thermal and vacuum
field fluctuations for significant temperatures, e.g. at ambient conditions.
These observations (loss of entanglement and coupling to quantum fluctuations)
has far reaching consequences for the understanding and control of polaritonic
chemistry and materials science, since a semi-classical theoretical description
of light-matter interaction becomes feasible, but the typical canonical
equilibrium assumption for the nuclear dynamics remains broken. This opens the
door for quantum fluctuations induced stochastic resonance phenomena under
vibrational strong coupling. A plausible theoretical mechanism to explain the
experimentally observed resonance phenomena in absence of periodic driving,

faster than desorption, which we attribute to the protein-mediated molecular
adhesion mechanism of the cells. Adsorption experiments using phototactically

structured continuous frames for functions on the real line. Herein, we
generalize this framework to the setting of functions of arbitrary

time-frequency representations carry over to higher dimensions, we determine
conditions on the warping function which guarantee that the associated Gramian
is well-localized, so that associated families of coorbit spaces can be
constructed. We then show that discrete Banach frame decompositions for these
coorbit spaces can be obtained by sampling the continuous warped time-frequency
systems. In particular, this implies that sparsity of a given function $f$ in
the discrete warped time-frequency dictionary is equivalent to membership of
$f$ in the coorbit space. We put special emphasis on the case of radial warping
functions, for which the relevant assumptions simplify considerably.

an LU- and UL-decomposition, based on a matrix refactorization, for the product

By analysing the bispectrum and reduced bispectrum of Dark Matter (DM), we show
that the strong MG signal present in the DM bispectrum is mainly due to the
enhanced power spectrum. We warn about adopting screening approximations in
simulations as this neglects non-linear contributions that can source a
significant component of the MG bispectrum signal at the DM level, but we argue
that this is not a problem for the bispectrum of galaxies in redshift space

perform void-finding on our galaxy mock catalogues by the ZOBOV watershed

the void profiles entering into the RSD model. We find relevant MG signals in

This allows us to show that the damping coefficient acquires a correction at

numerically small but conceptually interesting finding that the response is a
function of the frequency at which a stochastic system is probed. The method is
easily generalizable to different kinds of nonlinearity and replacing the

noise driven escape from a potential well. If we add a periodic forcing to the

convergence time of distributed AI and the application layer performance of
URLLC. Unless we leverage the existing 5G-NR quality of service handling
mechanisms to separate the traffic from the two services, our simulation
results show that the impact of distributed AI on the availability of the URLLC

to entirely break the security of a target device. As finite-state machines
(FSMs) are fundamental hardware building blocks responsible for controlling
systems, inducing faults into these controllers enables an adversary to hijack
the execution of the integrated circuit. A common defense strategy mitigating
these attacks is to manually instantiate FSMs multiple times and detect faults
using a majority voting logic. However, as each additional FSM instance only
provides security against one additional induced fault, this approach scales
poorly in a multi-fault attack scenario.
  In this paper, we present SCFI: a strong, probabilistic FSM protection
mechanism ensuring that control-flow deviations from the intended control-flow
are detected even in the presence of multiple faults. At its core, SCFI
consists of a hardened next-state function absorbing the execution history as
well as the FSM's control signals to derive the next state. When either the
absorbed inputs, the state registers, or the function itself are affected by
faults, SCFI triggers an error with no detection latency. We integrate SCFI
into a synthesis tool capable of automatically hardening arbitrary unprotected
FSMs without user interaction and open-source the tool. Our evaluation shows
that SCFI provides strong protection guarantees with a better area-time product
than FSMs protected using classical redundancy-based approaches. Finally, we
formally verify the resilience of the protected state machines using a

of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and the size of their 'mass-step', the
relationship between SN Ia host galaxy stellar mass ($M_\mathrm{stellar}$) and
SN Ia Hubble residual, and suggest that the cause of this relationship is dust.
Using 675 photometrically-classified SNe Ia from the Dark Energy Survey 5-year
sample, we study the differences in Hubble residual for a variety of global
host galaxy and local environmental properties for SN Ia subsamples split by
their colour. We find a $3\sigma$ difference in the mass-step when comparing
blue ($c<0$) and red ($c>0$) SNe. We observe the lowest r.m.s. scatter
($\sim0.14$ mag) in the Hubble residual for blue SNe in low mass/blue
environments, suggesting that this is the most homogeneous sample for
cosmological analyses. By fitting for $c$-dependent relationships between
Hubble residuals and $M_\mathrm{stellar}$, approximating existing dust models,
we remove the mass-step from the data and find tentative $\sim 2\sigma$
residual steps in rest-frame galaxy $U-R$ colour. This indicates that dust
modelling based on $M_\mathrm{stellar}$ may not fully explain the remaining
dispersion in SN Ia luminosity. Instead, accounting for a $c$-dependent
relationship between Hubble residuals and global $U-R$, results in
$\leq1\sigma$ residual steps in $M_\mathrm{stellar}$ and local $U-R$,
suggesting that $U-R$ provides different information about the environment of
SNe Ia compared to $M_\mathrm{stellar}$, and motivating the inclusion of galaxy
$U-R$ colour in SN Ia distance bias correction.

  Indeed, classification is one of the most popular tasks in machine learning,

  Unlike past work on loss function design, which was guided mainly by
intuition and theory before being validated by experimentation, here we propose
to approach this problem in the opposite way: we seek to extract knowledge by

  This data-driven approach is similar to that used in physics to discover
general laws from data.
  We used a symbolic regression method to automatically find a mathematical

  The formula discovered on more than 260 datasets of embeddings has a
Pearson's correlation of 0.96 and a $r^2$ of 0.93.

proposed as a platform for exploring many nontrivial quantum phenomena on
curved spaces. However, as the shell-shaped trapping potential generated with
the conventional radio frequency dressing method is very sensitive to gravity,
so far experimental studies of shell BECs can only be performed in
micro-gravity environments. Here, we overcome this difficulty and create a
shell BEC in the presence of Earth's gravity with immiscible dual-species BECs
of sodium and rubidium atoms. After minimizing the displacement between the
centers of mass of the two BECs with a magic-wavelength optical dipole trap,
the interspecies repulsive interaction ensures the formation of a closed shell
of sodium atoms with its center filled by rubidium atoms. Releasing the double
BEC together from the trap, we observe explosion of the filled shell
accompanied by energy transfer from the inner BEC to the shell BEC. With the
inner BEC removed, we obtain a hollow shell BEC which shows self-interference
as a manifestation of implosion. Our results pave an alternative way for
investigating many of the intriguing physics offered by shell BECs.

mathematical framework for the analysis of 'stationary' multiple time-scale

a method of desingularization known as $\textit{blow-up}$. The theory for
'oscillatory' multiple time-scale systems which possess a limit cycle manifold
instead of (or in addition to) a critical manifold is less developed,
particularly in the non-normally hyperbolic regime. We show that the blow-up
method can be applied to analyse the global oscillatory transition near a
regular folded limit cycle manifold in a class of three time-scale systems with
two small parameters. The systems considered behave like oscillatory systems as
the smallest perturbation parameter tends to zero, and stationary systems as
both perturbation parameters tend to zero. The additional time-scale structure
is crucial for the applicability of the blow-up method, which cannot be applied
directly to the two time-scale counterpart of the problem. Our methods allow us
to describe the asymptotics and strong contractivity of all solutions which
traverse a neighbourhood of the global singularity. Our results cover a range
of different cases with respect to the relative time-scale of the angular

Representation (GFR) from original gait sequences or generate Local Feature
Representation (LFR) from several local parts. However, GFR tends to neglect
local details of human postures as the receptive fields become larger in the
deeper network layers. Although LFR allows the network to focus on the detailed
posture information of each local region, it neglects the relations among
different local parts and thus only exploits limited local information of
several specific regions. To solve these issues, we propose a global-local
based gait recognition network, named GaitGL, to generate more discriminative
feature representations. To be specific, a novel Global and Local Convolutional
Layer (GLCL) is developed to take full advantage of both global visual
information and local region details in each layer. GLCL is a dual-branch
structure that consists of a GFR extractor and a mask-based LFR extractor. GFR
extractor aims to extract contextual information, e.g., the relationship among
various body parts, and the mask-based LFR extractor is presented to exploit
the detailed posture changes of local regions. In addition, we introduce a
novel mask-based strategy to improve the local feature extraction capability.
Specifically, we design pairs of complementary masks to randomly occlude
feature maps, and then train our mask-based LFR extractor on various occluded
feature maps. In this manner, the LFR extractor will learn to fully exploit
local information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GaitGL achieves
better performance than state-of-the-art gait recognition methods. The average
rank-1 accuracy on CASIA-B, OU-MVLP, GREW and Gait3D is 93.6%, 98.7%, 68.0% and

paper, we propose a probabilistic multi-organ segmentation network with
hierarchical spatial-wise feature modulation to capture flexible organ semantic
variants and inject the learnt variants into different scales of feature maps
for guiding segmentation. More specifically, we design an input decomposition
module via a conditional variational auto-encoder to learn organ-specific
distributions on the low dimensional latent space and model richer organ
semantic variations that is conditioned on input images.Then by integrating
these learned variations into the V-Net decoder hierarchically via spatial
feature transformation, which has the ability to convert the variations into
conditional Affine transformation parameters for spatial-wise feature maps
modulating and guiding the fine-scale segmentation. The proposed method is
trained on the publicly available AbdomenCT-1K dataset and evaluated on two
other open datasets, i.e., 100 challenging/pathological testing patient cases
from AbdomenCT-1K fully-supervised abdominal organ segmentation benchmark and
90 cases from TCIA+&BTCV dataset. Highly competitive or superior quantitative
segmentation results have been achieved using these datasets for four abdominal
organs of liver, kidney, spleen and pancreas with reported Dice scores improved
by 7.3% for kidneys and 9.7% for pancreas, while being ~7 times faster than two
strong baseline segmentation methods(nnUNet and CoTr).

first discretize the primal-dual system by using mixed finite element methods,

Exploiting the well-posedness of the linearized problem on appropriate Sobolev

bounding the layer are subjected to a time-periodic heating. Above a threshold
value, the temperature gradient across the layer leads to an instability of an
initially quiescent state or a parallel flow, depending upon the angle of
inclination. The Floquet analysis of the underlying system reveals that under
modulation, the instability sets in as a convective roll pattern executing
harmonic or subharmonic oscillations, depending upon the modulation, the angle
of inclination, and Prandtl number of the fluid. Under modulation, the value of
the angle of inclination for the codimension-2 point is found to be a
nonconstant function of the amplitude and the frequency of modulation. Further,
the instability response in the fluid layer as a longitudinal mode is always
harmonic whereas the instability response as a transverse mode is harmonic, or
subharmonic, or bicritical depending upon the modulation. The temperature
modulation offers a good control of time-periodic heat and mass transfer in the

liquid flows. These surfaces are complex and numerical simulations usually rely
on models for reducing this complexity. One of the simplest consists in finding
an equivalent boundary condition through an homogenisation procedure, which in
the case of channel flow over oriented riblets, leads to the presence of a
small spanwise component in the homogenized base flow velocity. This work aims
at investigating the influence of such a three-dimensionality of the base flow
on stability and transition in a channel with walls covered by oriented
riblets. Linear stability for this base flow is investigated: a new instability
region, linked to cross-flow effects, is observed. Tollmien-Schlichting waves
are also retrieved but the most unstable are three-dimensional. Transient
growth is also affected as oblique streaks with non-zero streamwise wavenumber
become the most amplified perturbations. When transition is induced by
Tollmien-Schlichting waves, after an initial exponential growth regime, streaky
structures with large spanwise wavenumber rapidly arise. Modal mechanisms
appear to play a leading role in the development of these structures and a
secondary stability analysis is realised to retrieve successfully some of their
characteristics. The second scenario, initiated with crossflow vortices,
displays a strong influence of nonlinearities. The flow develops into large
quasi spanwise-invariant structures before breaking down to turbulence.
Secondary stability on the saturated cross-flow vortices sheds light on this
stage of transition. In both cases, cross-flow effects dominate the flow
dynamics, suggestings the need to consider these effects when modelling
superhydrophobic surfaces.

low-rank tensor compression is extremely compact to store and query

volumes. In addition to the compact size, sub-wavelength spacing enables
superdirectivity for endfire operation, a phenomenon that has been mainly
studied for isotropic and infinitesimal radiators. In this work, we focus on
linear dipoles of arbitrary yet finite length. Specifically, we first introduce
an array model that accounts for the sinusoidal current distribution (SCD) on
very thin dipoles. Based on the SCD, the loss resistance of each dipole antenna
is precisely determined. Capitalizing on the derived model, we next investigate
the maximum achievable rate under a fixed power constraint. The optimal design
entails conjugate power matching along with maximizing the array gain. Our
theoretical analysis is corroborated by the method of moments under the
thin-wire approximation, as well as by full-wave simulations. Numerical results
showcase that a super-gain is attainable with high radiation efficiency when
the dipole antennas are not too short and thin.

interplay between intracluster medium (ICM) and interstellar medium (ISM). In
this paper, we present the study of an archival \textit{Chandra} observation of
the GASP jellyfish galaxy JO194. We observe X-ray emission extending from the
stellar disk to the unwinding spiral arms with an average temperature of
$kT=0.79\pm0.03$ keV. To investigate the origin of the X-ray emission, we
compare the observed X-ray luminosities with those expected from the star
formation rates (SFR) obtained from H$\alpha$ emission. We estimate an X-ray
luminosity excess of a factor $\sim2-4$ with respect to the SF, therefore we
conclude that SF is not the main responsible for the extended X-ray emission of
JO194. The metallicity in the spiral arms ($Z=0.24^{+0.19}_{-0.12} Z_{\odot}$)
is consistent with that of the ICM around JO194 ($Z=0.35\pm0.07$), thus we
suggest that the ICM radiative cooling dominates the X-ray emission of the
arms. We speculate that the X-ray plasma results from the ISM-ICM interplay,
although the nature of this interplay is still mostly unknown. Finally, we
observe that the X-ray properties of JO194 are consistent with those of two
other GASP galaxies with different stellar mass, phase-space conditions in
their hosting clusters, and local ICM conditions. We suggest that the
conditions required to induce extended X-ray emission in jellyfish galaxies are
established at the beginning of the stripping, and they can persist on long
time scales so that galaxies in different clusters and evolutionary stages can
present similar extended X-ray emission.

this, the optimal defender distribution that minimizes the harm incurred by

determined to be $\Theta_{CW}=102.8(1)\;\mathrm{K}$. Bifurcation of
field-cooled and zero-field-cooled data below $T_c$ in conjunction with a
frequency dependence of the peak position and a non-zero imaginary component
below $T_c$ shows it is in fact associated with a spin-glass transition. Highly
structured magnetic diffuse neutron scattering from single crystals develops
between $50\;\mathrm{K}$ and $25\;\mathrm{K}$ revealing the presence of
magnetic disorder which is correlated in nature. Here, the 3D-m$\Delta$PDF
method is used to visualize the local magnetic ordering preferences, and
ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic third nearest-neighbor
correlations are shown to be dominant. Their temperature dependence is
extraordinary with some flipping in sign, and a strongly varying correlation
length. The correlations can be explained by orbital interaction mechanisms for
the magnetic pathways, and a preferred spin cluster. Our study demonstrates the

precise selectivity to gold over a wide range of complex co-existing elements.
Here we report a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) material that has an ultrahigh
extraction capacity for trace amounts of gold (1,850 mg/g and 1,180 mg/g to 10
ppm and 1 ppm gold). The excellent gold extraction behavior is accounted to the
graphene areas and oxidized regions of rGO. The graphene areas spontaneously
reduce gold ions to metallic gold, and the oxidized regions provide a good
dispersibility so that efficient adsorption and reduction of gold ions by the
graphene area can be realized. The rGO is also highly selective to gold ions.
By controlling the protonation process of the functional groups on the oxidized
regions of rGO, it shows an exclusive gold extraction without adsorption of 14
co-existing elements seen in e-waste. These discoveries are further exploited
in highly efficient, continuous gold recycling from e-waste with good

However, the final result is still either obtained within a desired time or

collective results of the workers -- at an earlier stage than the final result.
This innovation makes it possible to have more effective deadline-based
systems, since even if a computational job is terminated because of timing, an
approximated version of the final result can be released. Based on our
theoretical and empirical results, the average execution delay for the first

the probability of meeting a deadline is one for the first resolution in a
setting where the final resolution exceeds the deadline almost all the time,
reducing the success rate of the systems with no layering.

the left-censoring and the nonlinear trajectory of viral load data, we

of their most distinguished properties are divergent zero-frequency
conductivities signalled by finite Drude weights. Singular conductivities owe
to long-lived quasiparticle excitations that propagate ballistically through
the system without any diffraction. The case of the celebrated quantum
Heisenberg chain, one of the best-studied many-body paradigms, turns out to be
particularly mysterious. About a decade ago, it was found that the spin Drude
weight in the critical phase of the model assumes an extraordinary, nowhere
continuous, dependence on the anisotropy parameter in the shape of a `popcorn
function'. This unprecedented discovery has been afterwards resolved at the
level of the underlying deformed quantum symmetry algebra which helps
explaining the erratic nature of the quasiparticle spectrum at commensurate
values of interaction anisotropy. This work is devoted to the captivating
phenomenon of discontinuous Drude weights, with the aim to give a broader
perspective on the topic by revisiting and reconciling various perspectives
from the previous studies. Moreover, it is argued that such an anomalous
non-ergodic feature is not exclusive to the integrable spin chain but can be
instead expected in a number of other integrable systems that arise from
realizations of the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_{q}(\mathfrak{sl}(2))$,
specialized to unimodular values of the quantum deformation parameter $q$. Our
discussion is framed in the context of gapless anisotropic quantum chains of
higher spin and the sine-Gordon quantum field theory in two space-time

studying how mass accretion rates scale with stellar and disk properties. The
spread in these relations can be used as a constraint to the models of disk
evolution, but only if the impact of accretion variability is correctly
accounted for. While the effect of variability might be substantial in the
embedded phases of star formation, it is often considered limited at later
stages. Here we report on the observed large variation in the accretion rate
for one target, XX Cha, and we discuss the impact on population studies of
classical T Tauri stars. The mass accretion rate determined by fitting the
UV-to-near-infrared spectrum in recent X-Shooter observations is compared with
the one measured with the same instrument 11 years before. XX Cha displays an
accretion variability of almost 2 dex between 2010 and 2021. Although the
timescales on which this variability happens are uncertain, XX Cha displays an
extreme accretion variability for a classical T Tauri star. If such behavior is
common among classical T Tauri stars, possibly on longer timescales than
previously probed, it could be relevant for discussing the disk evolution
models constrained by the observed spread in accretion rates. Finally, we
remark that previous studies of accretion variability based on spectral lines
may have underestimated the variability of some targets.

propose a novel method to mitigate smart jamming attacks on the massive
multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) uplink which does not
require the jammer to be active at any specific instant. By formulating an
optimization problem that unifies jammer estimation and mitigation, channel
estimation, and data detection, we exploit that a jammer cannot change its
subspace within a coherence interval. Theoretical results for our problem
formulation show that its solution is guaranteed to recover the users' data
symbols under certain conditions. We develop two efficient iterative algorithms
for approximately solving the proposed problem formulation: MAED, a
parameter-free algorithm which uses forward-backward splitting with a box
symbol prior, and SO-MAED, which replaces the prior of MAED with soft-output
symbol estimates that exploit the discrete transmit constellation and which
uses deep unfolding to optimize algorithm parameters. We use simulations to
demonstrate that the proposed algorithms effectively mitigate a wide range of
smart jammers without a priori knowledge about the attack type.

that particle crossings are prohibited) of interacting hardcore charged
particles, we exhibit a novel type of dynamical universality reflected through
anomalous statistical properties of macroscopic fluctuating observables such as
the charge transfer. We find that stringent dynamical constraints lead to
universal anomalous statistics of cumulative charge currents manifested both on
the timescale characteristic of typical fluctuations and also in the rate
function describing rare events. By computing the full counting statistics of
net transferred charge between two extended subsystems, we establish a number
of unorthodox dynamical properties in an analytic fashion. Most prominently,
typical fluctuations in equilibrium are governed by a universal distribution
that markedly deviates from the expected Gaussian statistics, whereas large
fluctuations are described by an exotic large-deviation rate function featuring
an exceptional triple critical point. Far from equilibrium, competition between
dynamical phases leads to dynamical phase transitions of first and second order
and spontaneous breaking of fluctuation symmetry of the univariate charge
large-deviation function. The rich phenomenology of the outlined dynamical
universality is exemplified on an exactly solvable classical cellular automaton

growth is driven by a weighted sum of trade partners' growth and an
independently-drawn idiosyncratic shock. I show that the idiosyncratic risk
assumption in a broad class of network models implicitly generates restrictions
on the network weights which are unrealistic. When allowing for correlated
shocks, units are exposed to an additional risk term which captures the ability
to substitute away from supply and demand shocks propagating through the
network. I provide empirical evidence that changes in substitutability between
trade partners are inversely related to changes in the panel of realized
industry variance. Moreover, I find that supply-side (demand-side)
substitutability is closely related to technological (product) dispersion of a
unit's suppliers (customers). To synthesize these results, I propose a
production-based asset pricing model in which supply chain substitutability is
a function of dispersion in product/technology space and correlation in supply
and demand shocks is driven by shared customers and suppliers between firms.
The model predicts that assets which are positively exposed to average
propagation of upstream and downstream shocks are useful hedges and thus earn
lower average risk premia. Consistently, I find that estimated upstream
(downstream) propagation factors earn return spreads of -11.4% (-4.2%) and are
negatively associated with aggregate consumption, output, and dividend growth.

single-loop NGQC schemes are sensitive to the operational control error, i.e.,
the $X$ error, due to the limitations of the implementation. Here, we propose a
robust scheme for NGQC combining with the dynamical correction technique, which

numerically show that our scheme can greatly improve the gate robustness in

Furthermore, to fight against the dephasing noise, due to the $Z$ error, we can
incorporate the decoherence-free subspace encoding strategy. In this way, our
scheme can be robust against both types of errors. Finally, we also propose how
to implement the scheme with encoding on superconducting quantum circuits with
experimentally demonstrated technology. Therefore, due to the intrinsic
robustness, our scheme provides a promising alternation for the future scalable

specifying the structure for how the utilities/state transitions enter the

$(231, \{1\}, \{1\})$, while an ascent sequence is a sequence of nonnegative

of ascents to its left. Fishburn permutations and ascent sequences are linked
by a bijection $g$ of Bousquet-M\'elou, Claesson, Dukes, and Kitaev. We write
$F_n(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_k)$ to denote the set of Fishburn permutations of

$A_n(201)$. Building on work of Gil and Weiner, we use elementary techniques to
enumerate $F_n(123)$ with respect to inversion number and number of

Learning-based models in this segmentation task, most of them are heavily
parametrized and thus have limited use in practical applications. This paper
proposes IterMiUnet, a new lightweight convolution-based segmentation model
that requires significantly fewer parameters and yet delivers performance
similar to existing models. The model makes use of the excellent segmentation
capabilities of Iternet architecture but overcomes its heavily parametrized
nature by incorporating the encoder-decoder structure of MiUnet model within
it. Thus, the new model reduces parameters without any compromise with the
network's depth, which is necessary to learn abstract hierarchical concepts in
deep models. This lightweight segmentation model speeds up training and
inference time and is potentially helpful in the medical domain where data is
scarce and, therefore, heavily parametrized models tend to overfit. The
proposed model was evaluated on three publicly available datasets: DRIVE,
STARE, and CHASE-DB1. Further cross-training and inter-rater variability
evaluations have also been performed. The proposed model has a lot of potential
to be utilized as a tool for the early diagnosis of many diseases.

interpolation methods such as Gaussian process regression, our method possesses
strong multifractal properties and is thus applicable to a broad range of
real-world time series, e.g. from solar wind or atmospheric turbulence.
Furthermore, we provide a sampling algorithm in terms of a mixing procedure
that consists of generating a 1 + 1-dimensional field u(t, {\xi}), where each
Gaussian component u{\xi}(t) is synthesized with identical underlying noise but
different covariance function C{\xi}(t,s) parameterized by a log-normally
distributed parameter {\xi}. Due to the Gaussianity of each component
u{\xi}(t), we can exploit standard sampling alogrithms such as Fourier or
wavelet methods and, most importantly, methods to constrain the process on the
sparse measurement points. The scale mixture u(t) is then initialized by
assigning each point in time t a {\xi}(t) and therefore a specific value from
u(t, {\xi}), where the time-dependent parameter {\xi}(t) follows a log-normal
process with a large correlation time scale compared to the correlation time of
u(t, {\xi}). We juxtapose Fourier and wavelet methods and show that a
multiwavelet-based hierarchical approximation of the interpolating paths, which
produce a sparse covariance structure, provide an adequate method to locally
interpolate large and sparse datasets.

development of microstructures during AM to achieve desired properties. Here we
study the microstructure development of a single melt pool, the building block
of AM-fabricated metallic component, using a phase-field model specifically
developed for the rapid solidification of AM. It is found that during the rapid
solidification of the melt pool, the solid-liquid interface is initially
controlled by solute diffusion followed by a thermal diffusion-controlled stage
with an undercooling larger than the freezing range. This switching of
controlling mechanisms leads to the sudden changes in interfacial velocity,
solute concentration, and temperature, which perfectly explains the formation
of various heterogeneous microstructures observed in AM. By manipulating the

controlled to form refined microstructures or layered structures for improved

90% of quasars is unclear. Observing a sample of eight radio-quiet quasars with
the Very Long Baseline Array, we discovered that their radio properties depend
strongly on their Eddington ratio (r_Edd=L_AGN/L_Edd). At lower Eddington
ratios (r_Edd < 0.3), the total radio emission of the AGN predominately
originates from an extremely compact region, possibly as small as the accretion
disk. At higher Eddington ratios (r_Edd > 0.3), the relative contribution of
this compact region decreases significantly, and though the total radio power
remains about the same, the emission now originates from regions >100 pc large.
The change in the physical origin of the radio-emitting plasma region with
r_Edd is unexpected, as the properties of radio-loud quasars show no dependence
with Eddington ratio. Our results suggest that at lower Eddington ratios the
magnetised plasma is likely confined by the accretion disk corona, and only at
higher Eddington ratios escapes to larger scales. Stellar-mass black holes show
a similar dependence of their radio properties on the accretion rate,
supporting the paradigm which unifies the accretion onto black holes across the

informs early star formation and reionization physics during the Cosmic Dawn
and Epoch of Reionization. Until recently, based on the strong gravitational
lensing cluster deep surveys, the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) has found a
potential turnover in the ultraviolet (UV) LF at z$\sim$6. In this paper, we
analyze the contribution of extremely faint galaxies with the magnitude larger
than the turnover magnitude in LF to cosmic reionization. We apply the
measurement from HFF to our suppressed star formation efficiency model,
including three free parameters: halo mass threshold $M_t$, curvature parameter
$\beta$ and a UV conversion factor $l_{\rm UV}$. According to our fit of 68\%
confidence level, the high-redshift star formation in haloes smaller than $
M_t=1.82^{+2.86}_{-1.08}\times10^{10} \rm M_{\odot}$ is found to be dampened.
The turnover magnitude $\rm \gtrsim -13.99-2.45$, correspondingly the halo mass
$\lesssim(4.57+20.03)\times10^{9} \rm M_{\odot}$. We find that the absorption
trough in the global 21-cm signal is sensitive to our SFE model parameters.
Together with ($\beta$, $l_{\rm UV}$) = ($2.17^{+2.42}_{-1.72}$,
$9.33^{+0.43}_{-0.42} \rm ~erg~yr ~s^{-1}M_{\odot}^{-1})$, the trough locates

$-237^{-6}_{+7}$ $\rm mK$, compared to (106\rm MHz, -212\rm mK) in the absence
of turnover. Besides, we find that the star formation of faint galaxies has
also an impact on the 21-cm power spectra. The best fitting peak power
decreases by $\sim4\%$ and shifts towards smaller scales from $0.88 h \rm
Mpc^{-1}$ to $0.91 h \rm Mpc^{-1}$. According to our calculation, such impact
is distinguishable with the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array.

prior to the superconducting state in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ has drawn enormous
attention, as the unusual superconductivity might inherit the symmetry of the
nematic phase. Although many efforts have been devoted to resolve the charge
orders using real-space microscopy and transport measurements, the direct
evidence on the rotation symmetry breaking of the electronic structure in the
CDW state from the reciprocal space is still rare. The underlying mechanism is
still ambiguous. Here, utilizing the micron-scale spatially resolved
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observed the fingerprint of band
folding in the CDW phase of KV$_3$Sb$_5$, which yet demonstrates the
unconventional unidirectionality, and is indicative of the rotation symmetry
breaking from $C_6$ to $C_2$. We then pinpointed that the interlayer coupling
between adjacent planes with $\pi$-phase offset in the 2$\times$2$\times$2 CDW
phase would lead to the preferred twofold symmetric electronic structure.
Time-reversal symmetry is further broken at temperatures below $\sim$ 40 K as
characterized by giant anomalous Hall effect triggered by weak magnetic fields.

defects in monolayer MoS2, that is, S monovacancy, S divacancy and MoS (Mo

findings are revealed: (1) The SBH for the monolayer MoS2 with defects is
universally higher than that for its defect-free counterpart. (2) S divacancy
and MoS antisite defects increase the SBH to a larger extent than S
monovacancy. (3) A defect located in the inner sublayer of MoS2, which is

simple articulated objects to complex mechanical systems. However, despite
their relevance, most model-based 3D tracking methods only consider rigid
objects. To overcome this limitation, we propose a flexible framework that
allows the extension of existing 6DoF algorithms to kinematic structures. Our
approach focuses on methods that employ Newton-like optimization techniques,
which are widely used in object tracking. The framework considers both
tree-like and closed kinematic structures and allows a flexible configuration
of joints and constraints. To project equations from individual rigid bodies to
a multi-body system, Jacobians are used. For closed kinematic chains, a novel
formulation that features Lagrange multipliers is developed. In a detailed
mathematical proof, we show that our constraint formulation leads to an exact
kinematic solution and converges in a single iteration. Based on the proposed
framework, we extend ICG, which is a state-of-the-art rigid object tracking
algorithm, to multi-body tracking. For the evaluation, we create a
highly-realistic synthetic dataset that features a large number of sequences
and various robots. Based on this dataset, we conduct a wide variety of
experiments that demonstrate the excellent performance of the developed
framework and our multi-body tracker.

temporal gauge in $ H^{\sigma} $ for $ \sigma > \frac{5}{6} $.
  Unlike related equations, Yang-Mills is not directly amenable to the method
of almost conservation laws (I-method) in its Fourier and global version. We
propose a modified energy which:
  1) Is gauge-invariant and easy to localize
  2) Provides local gauges which give control of local Sobolev norms (through
an Uhlenbeck-type lemma for fractional regularities)
  3) Is slightly smoother in time compared to the classical I-method energy for
related systems.
  The spatial smoothing is realized via the Yang-Mills heat flow instead of the
multiplier $I$.
  Due to the temporal condition and its finite speed of propagation, the local
gauge selection is compatible with recent initial data extension results.
Therefore, smoothened energy differences can be partitioned into local pieces
whose (appropriately extended) bounds can be square summed. After revealing the
null structure within the trilinear integrals, these can be estimated using
known methods.
  In an appendix we show how an invariant modified energy for
Maxwell-Klein-Gordon can extend previous results to regularities $ \sigma >

CFD study is to give insight into the water landing phase of the aircraft
emergency ditching. The pressure variations over the wetted surface and the
features of the free surface are analysed in detail, showing a marked
difference among the three shapes in terms of the configuration of the thin
spray generated at the front. Such a difference is a consequence of the
different transverse curvature of the fuselage bodies. Furthermore, it is
observed that at the rear, where a change of longitudinal curvature occurs, a
region of negative pressure (i.e. below the atmospheric value) develops. This
generates a suction (downward) force of pure hydrodynamic origin. In order to
better understand the role played by the longitudinal curvature change on the
loads, a fourth fuselage shape truncated at the rear is also considered in the
study. The forces acting on the fuselage models are considered as composed of
three terms: the viscous, the hydrodynamic and the buoyancy contributions. For

in the radial implosion phase and the pinch phase of a plasma focus has raised
many questions of fundamental importance. The most fundamental of these is the
fact of its existence, which is incomprehensible in terms of a conventional
view of plasma physics. The plasma is known to have an axis of symmetry in the
radial implosion phase. The axial magnetic field has a defined polarity with
respect to the axis. Since the equations of magnetohydrodynamics are unchanged
by flipping the sign of the axial coordinate, the polarity of the axial
magnetic field must arise from the initial conditions. Exactly how the initial
conditions determine the polarity of the axial magnetic field is not clear.
More data are needed to guide theoretical developments of this question. There
are several technical problems with the conventional techniques of axial
magnetic field measurement such as magnetic probes and Faraday rotation
measurement. The combined effect of theoretical and experimental difficulties
is that researchers avoid research related to the axial magnetic field in
axisymmetric plasmas in favour of more result-oriented projects, with the
unfortunate consequence that questions related to the presence of axial
magnetic field in axially symmetric plasmas remain unresolved. In order to
promote research related to the questions related to the axial magnetic field
in the plasma focus and other plasmas with an axial symmetry, this paper
introduces a new technique that skirts the technical difficulties of
measurement by redefining the objectives and scope of measurement. The paper is
written in a tutorial format for the benefit of young researchers just
beginning their research career and hence will not be published in regular

accurately represent pollutant concentration spatial variability. Finding a way
to synthesize this large amount of information to improve the accuracy of
lower-fidelity operational models (e.g. providing better turbulence closure
terms) is particularly appealing. This is a challenge in multi-query contexts,
where LES become prohibitively costly to deploy to understand how plume flow
and tracer dispersion change with various atmospheric and source parameters. To
overcome this issue, we propose a non-intrusive reduced-order model combining
proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) to
predict LES field statistics of interest associated with tracer concentrations.
GPR hyperpararameters are optimized component-by-component through a maximum a
posteriori (MAP) procedure informed by POD. We provide a detailed analysis of
the reducedorder model performance on a two-dimensional case study

heterogeneities upstream of the obstacle require a large number of POD modes to
be well captured. We also show that the component-by-component optimization
allows to capture the range of spatial scales in the POD modes, especially the
shorter concentration patterns in the high-order modes. The reduced-order model
predictions remain acceptable if the learning database is made of at least
fifty to hundred LES snapshot providing a first estimation of the required

apply it to a stochastic velocity distribution in order to demonstrate
sustained delay and duration of peak intensity in the widely Doppler broadened

with cosmic strings being the best motivated example. While in most cases one
studies Nambu-Goto or Abelian-Higgs strings, one also expects that
cosmologically realistic strings should have additional degrees of freedom in
their worldsheets, one specific example being superstrings from Type IIB
superstring theory. Here we continue the scientific exploitation of our
recently developed multi-GPU field theory cosmic strings code to study the
evolution of U(1)$\times$U(1) multitension networks, which are a numerically
convenient proxy: these contain two lowest-tension strings networks able to
interact and form bound states, providing a convenient first approximation to
the behaviour expected from cosmic superstrings. (...) We rely on the largest
field theory simulations of this model so far, specifically $4096^3$, $\Delta x
= 0.5$ boxes. We present robust evidence of scaling for the lightest strings,
measured through a complete and self-consistent set of correlation length and
velocity diagnostics. We also find a linearly growing average length of the
bound state segments, consistent with a scaling behaviour. (In previously
reported lower-resolution simulations, such behaviour had only been identified
with carefully engineered initial conditions, rich in those segments.) Finally,
while we see no evidence of a large population of bound states forming at early
stages of the network evolution, we do present tentative evidence for an
asymptotic constant value of the fraction of bound states, with this value
being different in the radiation and the matter eras. Our work demonstrates
that our GPU-accelerated field theory code can by successfully extended beyond
the simple Abelian-Higgs approximation, and enables future detailed studies of
realistic string networks and of their observational signatures.

  Fourier analysis perspective",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A long-standing issue in the parallel-in-time community is the poor
convergence of standard iterative parallel-in-time methods for hyperbolic
partial differential equations (PDEs), and for advection-dominated PDEs more
broadly. Here, a local Fourier analysis (LFA) convergence theory is derived for
the two-level variant of the iterative parallel-in-time method of multigrid
reduction-in-time (MGRIT). This closed-form theory allows for new insights into
the poor convergence of MGRIT for advection-dominated PDEs when using the
standard approach of rediscretizing the fine-grid problem on the coarse grid.
Specifically, we show that this poor convergence arises, at least in part, from
inadequate coarse-grid correction of certain smooth Fourier modes known as
characteristic components, which was previously identified as causing poor
convergence of classical spatial multigrid on steady-state advection-dominated
PDEs. We apply this convergence theory to show that, for certain
semi-Lagrangian discretizations of advection problems, MGRIT convergence using
rediscretized coarse-grid operators cannot be robust with respect to CFL number
or coarsening factor. A consequence of this analysis is that techniques
developed for improving convergence in the spatial multigrid context can be
re-purposed in the MGRIT context to develop more robust parallel-in-time
solvers. This strategy has been used in recent work to great effect; here, we
provide further theoretical evidence supporting the effectiveness of this
approach.

predicting the structural evolution of a drying suspension containing one or
more types of colloidal particles. The assumed free-energy functional is a key
component of DDFT that dictates the thermodynamics of the model and, in turn,
the density flux due to a concentration gradient. In this work, we compare
several commonly used free-energy functionals for drying hard-sphere
suspensions including local-density approximations based on the ideal-gas,
virial, and Boubl\'{i}k-Mansoori-Carnahan-Starling-Leland (BMCSL) equations of
state as well as a weighted-density approximation based on fundamental measure
theory (FMT). To determine the accuracy of each functional, we model one- and
two-component hard-sphere suspensions in a drying film with varied initial
heights and compositions, and we compare the DDFT-predicted volume-fraction
profiles to particle-based Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations. FMT accurately
predicts the structure of the one-component suspensions even at high
concentrations and when significant density gradients develop, but the virial
and BMCSL equations of state provide reasonable approximations for smaller
concentrations at a reduced computational cost. In the two-component
suspensions, FMT and BMCSL are similar to each other but modestly overpredict
the extent of stratification by size compared to BD simulations. This work
provides helpful guidance for selecting thermodynamic models for soft materials

sedimentation.

by minimizing the SOP assuming a total power constraint. It is shown that the

fabricated with cryogenic plasma etching on n and p-type silicon wafers and
doped using ion-implantation with different dopant types, dosages and ion beam

morphing blade concept, through experimental tests on a 1.2 m diameter turbine.
We show that fluctuations in the root-bending moment, thrust and torque are

highlights some critical design aspects of morphing blades. For instance, it is
showed that the friction resistance can substantially decrease the
effectiveness of the system and thus must be minimised by design. Overall this

  Outperform MAML and Their Empirical Equivalence","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2112.13121",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, it has been observed that a transfer learning solution might be all
we need to solve many few-shot learning benchmarks -- thus raising important
questions about when and how meta-learning algorithms should be deployed. In
this paper, we seek to clarify these questions by 1. proposing a novel metric
-- the diversity coefficient -- to measure the diversity of tasks in a few-shot
learning benchmark and 2. by comparing Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and
transfer learning under fair conditions (same architecture, same optimizer, and
all models trained to convergence). Using the diversity coefficient, we show
that the popular MiniImageNet and CIFAR-FS few-shot learning benchmarks have
low diversity. This novel insight contextualizes claims that transfer learning
solutions are better than meta-learned solutions in the regime of low diversity
under a fair comparison. Specifically, we empirically find that a low diversity
coefficient correlates with a high similarity between transfer learning and
MAML learned solutions in terms of accuracy at meta-test time and
classification layer similarity (using feature based distance metrics like
SVCCA, PWCCA, CKA, and OPD). To further support our claim, we find this
meta-test accuracy holds even as the model size changes. Therefore, we conclude
that in the low diversity regime, MAML and transfer learning have equivalent
meta-test performance when both are compared fairly. We also hope our work
inspires more thoughtful constructions and quantitative evaluations of
meta-learning benchmarks in the future.

slave fermion algorithm to study the Mott transition. Upon local approximation,
our method yields a phase diagram with a zero-temperature continuous (Mott)
metal-insulator transition at finite Coulomb interaction $U$ for the
half-filled one-band Hubbard model on a square lattice, and the resistivity
exhibits a critical scaling around the quantum Widom line. We argue that the
Mott transition may be associated with a dynamic charge Kondo effect of local
degenerate doublon and holon states, causing sharp resonances on the
doublon/holon and electron spectra. The transition is pushed to $U=0$ once
intersite antiferromagnetic correlations are included, in agreement with exact
numerical calculations. Our approach captures some essential features of the
Mott transition and offers an alternative angle to view this important problem.
It can be extended to study other correlated electron models with more
complicated local interactions.

traditional robots, soft mechanisms and actuators still have significant
potential for damage or degradation particularly during unmodeled contact. This
article introduces a feedback strategy for safe soft actuator operation during
control of a soft robot. To do so, a supervisory controller monitors actuator
state and dynamically saturates control inputs to avoid conditions that could
lead to physical damage. We prove that, under certain conditions, the
supervisory controller is stable and verifiably safe. We then demonstrate
completely onboard operation of the supervisory controller using a soft
thermally-actuated robot limb with embedded shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators
and sensing. Tests performed with the supervisor verify its theoretical
properties and show stabilization of the robot limb's pose in free space.
Finally, experiments show that our approach prevents overheating during contact
(including environmental constraints and human contact) or when infeasible
motions are commanded. This supervisory controller, and its ability to be
executed with completely onboard sensing, has the potential to make soft robot
actuators reliable enough for practical use.

degree correlations, PageRank centrality, and graph-based clusters (or

devise new smoothness indicators that increase the error order from 2 to 4 when
CP1 occurs and perform more stably. Meanwhile, we construct a new global
smoothness indicator that increases the error order from 4 to 5 similarly,
through which new nonlinear weights with regard to WENO3-Z are derived and new
scale-independents improvements, namely WENO-ZES2 and -ZES3, are acquired.

we study the influence of DM on the spacetime structure and geodesic motion,
and provide a classification of the BH+DM shell spacetimes according to the
properties of the stable circular geodesics governing Keplerian disks. We focus
our attention on the epicyclic motion around circular geodesics that can be
related to observational phenomena in X-ray radiation from Keplerian accretion
disks, assumed to be influenced by the DM shell only gravitationally. We give
the frequencies of the orbital and epicyclic motions and discuss their
properties in terms of the parameters governing the DM shell. Using the
frequencies in relevant variants of the standard geodesic model of
high-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (HF QPOs), we test the role of DM by
fitting the HF QPO data from some microquasars and active galactic nuclei with
supermassive BHs where no variant of the geodesic model applied in the standard
vacuum BH background is able to explain the data. We thus provide a robust
review of the applicability of the geodesic model of HF QPOs, and also provide
limits on the amount of DM around a BH. We demonstrate that the geodesic model
could be well applied to most observations of active galactic nuclei, with
strong restrictions on the amount of invisible matter around BHs.

  Generalization","Accept to ACMMM2022",,,,"cs.LG math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model on one or more different but
related source domains that could be generalized into an unseen target domain.
Existing DG methods try to prompt the diversity of source domains for the
model's generalization ability, while they may have to introduce auxiliary
networks or striking computational costs. On the contrary, this work applies
the implicit semantic augmentation in feature space to capture the diversity of
source domains. Concretely, an additional loss function of distance metric
learning (DML) is included to optimize the local geometry of data distribution.
Besides, the logits from cross entropy loss with infinite augmentations is
adopted as input features for the DML loss in lieu of the deep features. We
also provide a theoretical analysis to show that the logits can approximate the
distances defined on original features well. Further, we provide an in-depth
analysis of the mechanism and rational behind our approach, which gives us a
better understanding of why leverage logits in lieu of features can help domain
generalization. The proposed DML loss with the implicit augmentation is
incorporated into a recent DG method, that is, Fourier Augmented Co-Teacher
framework (FACT). Meanwhile, our method also can be easily plugged into various
DG methods. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks (Digits-DG, PACS and
Office-Home) have demonstrated that the proposed method is able to achieve the
state-of-the-art performance.

motion of a damped double pendulum of unequal masses with its pivot vibrated
vertically are different from those obtained under gravity modulation. Linear
stability analysis shows that tongue-shaped marginal stability curves divide
the plane of driving parameters into multiple regions of subharmonic and
harmonic instabilities. The instability zones for one normal mode overlap with
those for the other. The double pendulum may oscillate or rotate about its
pivot harmonically or subharmonically. The limit cycles corresponding to the
normal mode oscillations of a double pendulum of equal masses are squeezed into
a line in its configuration space. For unequal masses, two marginal curves for
subharmonic instabilities merge to form a double-well shaped curve in the
presence of damping, which is qualitatively new. The pendulum shows driving
amplitude sensitive multi-period complex oscillations for driving parameters
near the extrema of the merged instability zones and boundaries of the
overlapping zones. For larger driving amplitude, the pendulum shows
subharmonic, harmonic or chaotic rotations. The Lyapunov exponents are computed
numerically as a function of driving amplitude for some cases.

depend on the execution of computational AI models against rich,

can develop and execute computational models that reveal concepts hidden in the

datasets, computing the performance of every computational model that can run
against a dataset is cost prohibitive in terms of cloud resources. Benchmarking
approaches used in practice use representative datasets to infer performance
without actually executing models. While practicable, these approaches limit
extensive dataset profiling to a few datasets and introduce bias that favors
models suited for representative datasets. As a result, each dataset's unique
characteristics are left unexplored and subpar models are selected based on
inference from generalized datasets. This necessitates a new paradigm that
introduces dataset profiling into the model selection process. To demonstrate
the need for dataset-specific profiling, we answer two questions:(1) Can
scientific datasets significantly permute the rank order of computational
models compared to widely used representative datasets? (2) If so, could
lightweight model execution improve benchmarking accuracy? Taken together, the
answers to these questions lay the foundation for a new dataset-aware

the surface migrate towards the rotation center and sink there, mimicking a
`reverse Weissenberg effect'. The observed surface flow field suggests the
existence of a radial outward flow in the depth of the granular bed, thus
forming a convection cell. This flow field is connected with a dimple formed in
the rotation center. The effect is strongly dependent on the particle geometry

manipulating electromagnetic (EM) waves. Geometric phase can be readily
obtained by rotating the meta-atom of metasurfaces. Nevertheless, such
geometric phases are usually spin-coupled, with the same magnitude but opposite
signs for left_ and right_handed circularly polarized (LCP,RCP) waves. To
achieve independent control on LCP and RCP waves, it is crucial to obtain
spin-decoupled geometric phases. In this paper, we propose to obtain completely
spin-decoupled geometric phases by engineering surface current paths on
meta-atoms. Based on the rotational Doppler effect, the rotation manner is
firstly analyzed and it is found that the essence of generating geometric phase
lies in the rotation of surface current paths on meta-atoms. Since the induced
surface currents paths under LCP and RCP waves always start oppositely and are
mirror-symmetrical with each other, it is natural that the geometric phases be
with the same magnitude and opposite signs when the meta-atoms are rotated. To
obtain spin-decoupled geometric phases, the start point of induced surface
current under one spin should be rotated by an angle while that under the other
spin by another different angle. In this way, LCP and RCP waves can acquire
different geometric phase changes and spin-decoupled geometric phase can be
imparted by metasurfaces. Proof-of-principle prototypes were designed,
fabricated and measured. Both the simulation and experiment results verify
spin-decoupled geometric phases. This work provides a robust means of obtaining
spin-dependent geometric phase and will further adds up to the metasurface DOF
in manipulating EM waves.

communicate effectively by transmitting semantic meaning of data. Edge
components, such as vehicles in next-generation intelligent transport systems,
use well-trained semantic models to encode and decode semantic information
extracted from raw and sensor data. However, the limitation in computing
resources makes it difficult to support the training process of accurate
semantic models on edge devices. As such, edge devices can buy the pretrained
semantic models from semantic model providers, which is called ""semantic model
trading"". Upon collecting semantic information with the semantic models, the
edge devices can then sell the extracted semantic information, e.g.,
information about urban road conditions or traffic signs, to the interested
buyers for profit, which is called ""semantic information trading"". To
facilitate both types of the trades, effective incentive mechanisms should be
designed. Thus, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical trading system to
support both semantic model trading and semantic information trading jointly.
The proposed incentive mechanism helps to maximize the revenue of semantic
model providers in the semantic model trading, and effectively incentivizes
model providers to participate in the development of semantic communication
systems. For semantic information trading, our designed auction approach can
support the trading between multiple semantic information sellers and buyers,
while ensuring individual rationality, incentive compatibility, and budget
balance, and moreover, allowing them achieve higher utilities than the baseline
method.

test developed by Chevyrev and Oberhauser (2022) and relies on the notions of

samples of stochastic processes paths come from the same distribution. Our
contribution is to apply this test to a variety of one-dimensional stochastic
processes relevant for the modelling of equity stock price and volatility as
well as inflation in view of actuarial applications. At first, we present a
numerical analysis with synthetic data in order to measure the statistical
power of the test and then, we work with historical data to study the ability
of the test to discriminate between several models in practice. These numerical
experiments are conducted under two constraints:1. we consider an asymmetric
setting in which we compare a large sample of simulated real-world scenarios
and a small sample that consists of (or represents in the synthetic data case)
historical data, both with a monthly time step as often considered in practice
and2. we make the two samples identical from the perspective of validation
methods used in practice, i.e. we impose that the marginal distributions of the
two samples are the same or very close at a given one-year horizon.By
performing specific transformations of the signature, we obtain statistical
powers close to 1 in this framework. Moreover, we show that some models are
rejected and others are not when applying the test against historical data.
These numerical results demonstrate the potential of this validation approach
for real-world economic scenarios and more generally for any application
requiring to exhibit the consistency of a stochastic model with historical
paths. We also discuss several challenges related to the numerical
implementation of this approach, and highlight its domain of validity in terms
of the distance between models and the volume of data at hand.

considered as a deterministic regime which, most probably, was responsible for
the variations that was regarded as noise and thus was being modeled as a
stochastic process. In the second phase, it was of great significance to
establish criteria for detecting chaotic dynamics and thus establishing
dynamical invariants which were necessary in quantifying chaos. The third step

accomplish targeted delivery of cargos and biomedical manipulations at
microscale. However, it is still a great challenge to enable microrobots to
maneuver in a complex environment. Machine learning algorithms offer a tool to
boost mobility and flexibility of a synthetic microswimmer, hence could help us
design truly smart microrobots. In this work, we investigate how a model of sea
urchin sperm cell can self-learn chemotactic motion in a chemoattractant
concentration field. We employ an artificial neural network to act as a
decision-making agent and facilitate the sperm cell to discover efficient
maneuver strategies through a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. Our
results show that chemotactic behaviours, very similar to the realistic ones,
can be achieved by the DRL utilizing only limited environmental information. In
most cases, the DRL algorithm discovers more efficient strategies than the
human-devised one. Furthermore, the DRL can even utilize an external
disturbance to facilitate the chemotactic motion if the extra flow information
is also taken into account by the artificial neural network. Our results
provide insights to the chemotactic process of sea urchin sperm cells and also
prepare guidance for the intelligent maneuver of microrobots.
