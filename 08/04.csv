  Convolutional Neural Networks","Master Thesis",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have provided new and accurate methods
for processing digital images and videos. Yet, training CNNs is extremely
demanding in terms of computational resources. Also, for specific applications,
the standard use of transfer learning also tends to require far more resources
than what may be needed. Furthermore, the final systems tend to operate as
black boxes that are difficult to interpret. The current thesis considers the
problem of detecting faces from the AOLME video dataset. The AOLME dataset
consists of a large video collection of group interactions that are recorded in
unconstrained classroom environments. For the thesis, still image frames were
extracted at every minute from 18 24-minute videos. Then, each video frame was
divided into 9x5 blocks with 50x50 pixels each. For each of the 19440 blocks,
the percentage of face pixels was set as ground truth. Face detection was then
defined as a regression problem for determining the face pixel percentage for
each block. For testing different methods, 12 videos were used for training and
validation. The remaining 6 videos were used for testing. The thesis examines
the impact of using the instantaneous phase for the AOLME block-based face
detection application. For comparison, the thesis compares the use of the
Frequency Modulation image based on the instantaneous phase, the use of the
instantaneous amplitude, and the original gray scale image. To generate the FM
and AM inputs, the thesis uses dominant component analysis that aims to
decrease the training overhead while maintaining interpretability.

observables that contain valuable information about the interaction between
hyperons and nucleons. In this work we study strangeness $S = -1$ systems
$^{3,4}_\Lambda$H and $^{4,5}_\Lambda$He using the ab initio no-core shell
model (NCSM) with realistic interactions obtained from chiral effective field
theory ($\chi$EFT). In particular, we quantify the finite precision of
theoretical predictions that can be attributed to nuclear physics
uncertainties. We study both the convergence of the solution of the many-body
problem (method uncertainty) and the regulator- and calibration data-dependence
of the nuclear $\chi$EFT Hamiltonian (model uncertainty). For the former, we
implement infrared correction formulas and extrapolate finite-space NCSM
results to infinite model space. We then use Bayesian parameter estimation to
quantify the resulting method uncertainties. For the latter, we employ a family
of 42 realistic Hamiltonians and measure the standard deviation of predictions
while keeping the leading-order hyperon-nucleon interaction fixed. Following
this procedure we find that model uncertainties of ground-state $\Lambda$
separation energies amount to $\sim 20(100)$ keV in
$^3_\Lambda$H($^4_\Lambda$H,He) and $\sim 400$ keV in $^5_\Lambda$He. Method
uncertainties are comparable in magnitude for the $^4_\Lambda$H,He $1^+$
excited states and $^5_\Lambda$He, which are computed in limited model spaces,
but otherwise much smaller. This knowledge of expected theoretical precision is
crucial for the use of binding energies of light hypernuclei to infer the
elusive hyperon-nucleon interaction.

tolerances, and thus models that predict the response to inevitable
disturbances are essential. The mathematical modeling complexities are reduced
through linearization as even small thickness variations in films can render a
product unsalable. The signaling problem, considered in this paper, is perhaps
the simplest model that incorporates the effects of repetitive (oscillatory)
disturbances that are initiated, for example, by room vibrations and pump
drives. In prior work, Gordillo and P\'erez (Phys. Fluids 14, 2002) examined
the structure of the signaling response for linear operators that admit
exponentially growing or damped solutions, i.e., the medium is classified as
unstable or stable via classical stability analysis. The signaling problem
admits two portions of the solution, the transient behavior due to the start-up
of the disturbance and the long-time behavior that is continually forced; the
superposition reveals how the forced solution evolves through the passage of a
transient. In this paper, we examine signaling for the linear operator examined
by King et al. (King et al. 2016, Phys. Rev. Fluids 1(7)) that governs varicose
waves in a thin liquid sheet and that can admit solutions having algebraic
growth although the underlying medium is classified as being neutrally stable.
Long-time asymptotic methods are used to extract critical velocities that
partition the response into distinct regions having markedly different
location-dependent responses, and the amplitudes of oscillatory responses in
these regions are determined. Together, these characterize the magnitude and
breadth of the solution response. Results indicate that the signaling response
in neutrally stable flows (that admit algebraic growth) is significantly
different from that in exponentially unstable systems.

dependent by folk psychology and society in general. The term artificial
intelligence and the kind of problems that it managed to solve in the recent
years has been shown as an argument to establish that machines experience some
sort of consciousness. Following the analogy of Russell, if a machine is able
to do what a conscious human being does, the likelihood that the machine is
conscious increases. However, the social implications of this analogy are
catastrophic. Concretely, if rights are given to entities that can solve the
kind of problems that a neurotypical person can, does the machine have
potentially more rights that a person that has a disability? For example, the
autistic syndrome disorder spectrum can make a person unable to solve the kind
of problems that a machine solves. We believe that the obvious answer is no, as
problem solving does not imply consciousness. Consequently, we will argue in
this paper how phenomenal consciousness and, at least, computational
intelligence are independent and why machines do not possess phenomenal
consciousness, although they can potentially develop a higher computational
intelligence that human beings. In order to do so, we try to formulate an
objective measure of computational intelligence and study how it presents in
human beings, animals and machines. Analogously, we study phenomenal
consciousness as a dichotomous variable and how it is distributed in humans,
animals and machines. As phenomenal consciousness and computational
intelligence are independent, this fact has critical implications for society
that we also analyze in this work.

RealPatch, a framework for simpler, faster, and more data-efficient data

three coverage criteria to generate diverse and valid computational graphs; 2)
full use of high-level IRs language features to generate diverse IRs; 3) three

two-dimensional magnets for next-generation devices, an accurate description of
their electronic structure and magnetic interactions has proven challenging to
achieve. Here, we quantify electronic excitations and spin interactions in
Cr$X_3$ ($X=$~Cl, Br, I) using embedded many-body wavefunction calculations and
fully generalized spin Hamiltonians. We find that the three trihalides feature
comparable $d$-shell excitations, consisting of a high-spin $^4A_2$
$(t^3_{2g}e^0_{g})$ ground state lying 1.5$-$1.7 eV below the first excited
state $^4T_2$ ($t^2_{2g}e^1_{g}$). CrCl$_3$ exhibits a single-ion anisotropy
$A_{\rm sia} = -0.02$ meV, while the Cr spin-3/2 moments are ferromagnetically
coupled through bilinear and biquadratic exchange interactions of $J_1 = -0.97$
meV and $J_2 = -0.05$ meV, respectively. The corresponding values for CrBr$_3$
and CrI$_3$ increase to $A_{\rm sia} = -0.08$ meV and $A_{\rm sia} = -0.12$ meV
for the single-ion anisotropy, $J_1 = -1.21$ meV, $J_2 = -0.05$ meV and $J_1 =
-1.38$ meV, $J_2 = -0.06$ meV for the exchange couplings, respectively. We find
that the overall magnetic anisotropy is defined by the interplay between
$A_{\rm sia}$ and $A_{\rm dip}$ due to magnetic dipole-dipole interaction that
favors in-plane orientation of magnetic moments in ferromagnetic monolayers and
bulk layered magnets. The competition between the two contributions sets
CrCl$_3$ and CrI$_3$ as the easy-plane ($A_{\rm sia}+ A_{\rm dip} > 0$) and
easy-axis ($A_{\rm sia}+ A_{\rm dip} < 0$) ferromagnets, respectively. The
differences between the magnets trace back to the atomic radii of the halogen
ligands and the magnitude of spin-orbit coupling. Our findings are in excellent
agreement with recent experiments, thus providing reference values for the
fundamental interactions in chromium trihalides.

all improvements of an old algorithm due to Prange: they are known under the

algorithm which does not belong to this family was proposed: statistical
decoding. It is a randomized algorithm that requires the computation of a large
set of parity-checks of moderate weight, and uses some kind of majority voting
on these equations to recover the error. This algorithm was long forgotten
because even the best variants of it performed poorly when compared to the
simplest ISD algorithm.
  We revisit this old algorithm by using parity-check equations in a more
general way. Here the parity-checks are used to get LPN samples with a secret
which is part of the error and the LPN noise is related to the weight of the
parity-checks we produce. The corresponding LPN problem is then solved by
standard Fourier techniques. By properly choosing the method of producing these
low weight equations and the size of the LPN problem, we are able to outperform
in this way significantly information set decodings at code rates smaller than
$0.3$. It gives for the first time after $60$ years, a better decoding
algorithm for a significant range which does not belong to the ISD family.

reinforcement learning that has received extensive attention both in theory and
in practice. However, provable guarantees have been thus far either limited to
fully competitive or cooperative scenarios or impose strong assumptions that
are difficult to meet in most practical applications. In this work, we depart
from those prior results by investigating infinite-horizon \emph{adversarial
team Markov games}, a natural and well-motivated class of games in which a team
of identically-interested players -- in the absence of any explicit
coordination or communication -- is competing against an adversarial player.
This setting allows for a unifying treatment of zero-sum Markov games and
Markov potential games, and serves as a step to model more realistic strategic
interactions that feature both competing and cooperative interests. Our main
contribution is the first algorithm for computing stationary
$\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria in adversarial team Markov games with
computational complexity that is polynomial in all the natural parameters of
the game, as well as $1/\epsilon$. The proposed algorithm is particularly
natural and practical, and it is based on performing independent policy
gradient steps for each player in the team, in tandem with best responses from
the side of the adversary; in turn, the policy for the adversary is then
obtained by solving a carefully constructed linear program. Our analysis
leverages non-standard techniques to establish the KKT optimality conditions
for a nonlinear program with nonconvex constraints, thereby leading to a
natural interpretation of the induced Lagrange multipliers. Along the way, we
significantly extend an important characterization of optimal policies in
adversarial (normal-form) team games due to Von Stengel and Koller (GEB `97).

imply that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden variable
theories. Bell's inequality is the statement that if measurements are performed
independently on two space-like separated particles of an entangled pair, the
assumption that outcomes depend on hidden variables implies an upper bound on
the correlations between the outcomes. Quantum mechanics predicts correlations
which violate this upper bound. The CHSH inequality is a specific Bell
inequality in which classical correlation (i.e. if local hidden variables
exist) can take the maximum value of 2. Quantum mechanics violates this bound,
allowing for a higher bound on the correlation, which can take the maximum
value $2\sqrt{2}$, known as the Tsirelson bound. Popescu and Rohrlich showed
that the assumption of relativistic causality allows for an even higher bound
on the CHSH correlation, this value being 4. Why is the bound coming from
causality higher than the Tsirelson bound? Are there relativistic causal
dynamical theories which violate the Tsirelson bound? In the present paper we
answer this question in the affirmative. We show that the pre-quantum theory of
trace dynamics, from which quantum theory is emergent as a thermodynamic
approximation, permits the CHSH correlation to take values higher than
$2\sqrt{2}$. We interpret our findings to suggest that quantum theory is
approximate, and emergent from the more general theory of trace dynamics.

related to the emergence of a plethora of novel quantum matter states such as
unconventional superconductivity, electronic-nematic states, hidden order and
most recently topological states of matter such as topological Kondo insulators

challenge is that the archetypal Kondo lattice model that captures the

fundamental particles is to include flavor symmetries in the theories. In this
work, we investigate the rare charged lepton flavour violating (cLFV) decay
process ($\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$) in two of the low scale ($\sim$TeV) seesaw
models: (i) the Inverse seesaw (ISS) and (ii) Linear seesaw (LSS) models within
the framework of $A_{4}$ flavour symmetry. Apart from the $ A_{4} $ flavour
symmetry, some other symmetries like $U(1)_{X}$, $Z_4$ and $Z_5$ are included
to construct the Lagrangian. We use results from our previous work
\cite{Devi:2021ujp,Devi:2021aaz} where we computed unknown neutrino oscillation
parameters within $3 \sigma$ limits of their global best fit values, and apply
those results to compute the branching ratio (BR) of the muon decay for both
the seesaw models. Next we compare our results with the current experimental
bounds and sensitivity limits of BR($\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$) as projected by
various experiments, and present a comparative analysis that which of the two
models is more likely to be tested by which current/future experiment. This is
done for various values of currently allowed non-unitarity parameter. This
comparative study will help us to pinpoint that which of the low scale seesaw
models and triplet flavon VEV alignments will be more viable and favourable for
testing under a common flavour symmetry ($A_{4}$ here), and hence can help
discriminate between the two models.

Interacting spins combined with motion display exotic spin transport phenomena,
such as superfluidity arising from pairing of spins induced by spin attraction.
To understand these complex phenomena, an interacting spin system with high
controllability is desired. Quantum spin dynamics have been studied on
different platforms with varying capabilities. Here we demonstrate tunable
itinerant spin dynamics enabled by dipolar interactions using a gas of
potassium-rubidium molecules confined to two-dimensional planes, where a
spin-1/2 system is encoded into the molecular rotational levels. The dipolar
interaction gives rise to a shift of the rotational transition frequency and a
collision-limited Ramsey contrast decay that emerges from the coupled spin and
motion. Both the Ising and spin exchange interactions are precisely tuned by
varying the strength and orientation of an electric field, as well as the
internal molecular state. This full tunability enables both static and
dynamical control of the spin Hamiltonian, allowing reversal of the coherent
spin dynamics. Our work establishes an interacting spin platform that allows
for exploration of many-body spin dynamics and spin-motion physics utilizing
the strong, tunable dipolar interaction.

this model to optimize the design of ride-sharing services. Spatial
heterogeneity is addressed by partitioning the study region into a set of
relatively homogeneous zones, and a set of criteria are imposed to avoid
significant detours among matched passengers. A generalized multi-zone queuing
network model is then developed to describe how vehicles' states transition
within each zone and across neighboring zones, and how passengers are served by
idle or partially occupied vehicles. A large system of equations is constructed
based on the queuing network model to analytically evaluate steady-state system
performance. Then, we formulate a constrained nonlinear program to optimize the
design of ride-sharing services, such as zone-level vehicle deployment, vehicle
routing paths, and vehicle rebalancing operations. A customized solution
approach is also proposed to decompose and solve the optimization problem. The
proposed model and solution approach are applied to a hypothetical case and a
real-world Chicago case study, so as to demonstrate their applicability and to
draw insights. These numerical examples not only reveal interesting insights on
how ride-sharing services serve heterogeneous demand, but also highlight the

the expert increases throughout the course of an episode as more information is

behavior early on in an episode, by considering the entire history of states
and actions, they might be able to eventually identify the hidden context and
act as the expert would. We prove that on-policy imitation learning algorithms
(with or without access to a queryable expert) are better equipped to handle
these sorts of asymptotically realizable problems than off-policy methods. This
is because on-policy algorithms provably learn to recover from their initially
suboptimal actions, while off-policy methods treat their suboptimal past
actions as though they came from the expert. This often manifests as a latching
behavior: a naive repetition of past actions. We conduct experiments in a toy
bandit domain that show that there exist sharp phase transitions of whether
off-policy approaches are able to match expert performance asymptotically, in
contrast to the uniformly good performance of on-policy approaches. We
demonstrate that on several continuous control tasks, on-policy approaches are

actually perform worse when given access to history.

  Arrivals",,,,,"cs.DS cs.DM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The design of online policies for stochastic matching and revenue management
settings is usually bound by the Bayesian prior that the demand process is
formed by a fixed-length sequence of queries with unknown types, each drawn
independently. This assumption of serial independence implies that the demand
of each type, i.e., the number of queries of a given type, has low variance and
is approximately Poisson-distributed. Thus, matching policies are often based
on ``fluid'' LPs that only use the expectations of these distributions.
  This paper explores alternative stochastic models for online matching that
allow for nonparametric, higher variance demand distributions. We propose two
new models, \Indep and \Correl, that relax the serial independence assumption
in different ways by combining a nonparametric distribution for the demand with
standard assumptions on the arrival patterns -- adversarial or random-order. In
our \Indep model, the demand for each type follows an arbitrary distribution,
while being mutually independent across different types. In our \Correl model,
the total demand follows an arbitrary distribution, and conditional on the
sequence length, the type of each query is drawn independently. In both
settings, we show that the fluid LP relaxation based on only expected demands
can be an arbitrarily bad benchmark for algorithm design. We develop tighter LP
relaxations for the \Indep and \Correl models that leverage the exact
distribution of the demand, leading to matching algorithms that achieve
constant-factor performance guarantees under adversarial and random-order
arrivals. More broadly, our paper provides a data-driven framework for
expressing demand uncertainty (i.e., variance and correlations) in online
stochastic matching models.

nodes synchronously, as in on-premise supercomputers, is still far from
satisfactory due to network latencies. As a consequence, in said cases, HPCaaS
is recommended to be used with one or few instances. In this paper we take the
claim that new piece of memory hardware, namely Non-Volatile RAM (NVRAM), can
allow such computations to scale up to an order of magnitude with marginalized
penalty in comparison to RAM. Moreover, we suggest that the introduction of
NVRAM to HPCaaS can be cost-effective to the users and the suppliers in
numerous forms.

instance segmentation model, MinVIS outperforms the previous best result on the
challenging Occluded VIS dataset by over 10% AP. Since MinVIS treats frames in
training videos as independent images, we can drastically sub-sample the
annotated frames in training videos without any modifications. With only 1% of
labeled frames, MinVIS outperforms or is comparable to fully-supervised
state-of-the-art approaches on YouTube-VIS 2019/2021. Our key observation is
that queries trained to be discriminative between intra-frame object instances
are temporally consistent and can be used to track instances without any
manually designed heuristics. MinVIS thus has the following inference pipeline:
we first apply the trained query-based image instance segmentation to video
frames independently. The segmented instances are then tracked by bipartite
matching of the corresponding queries. This inference is done in an online
fashion and does not need to process the whole video at once. MinVIS thus has
the practical advantages of reducing both the labeling costs and the memory

phase space studies of the circular planar restricted three body problem, which
we have extended to the case of the three-dimensional restricted problem with
$N$ planetary perturbers. With this approach, we explore the dynamical
landscape of the 23 most distant TNOs under the perturbations of the known
giant planets. We find that, counter to common expectations, almost none of
these TNOs are far removed from Neptune's resonances. Nearly half (11) of these
TNOs have orbits consistent with stable libration in Neptune's resonances; in
particular, the orbits of TNOs 148209 and 474640 overlap with Neptune's 20:1

non-resonant, despite their large orbital uncertainties, because our mapping
approach determines the resonance boundaries in angular phase space in addition
to semimajor axis. Only three objects are in orbital regions not appreciably
affected by resonances: Sedna, 2012 VP113 and 2015 KG163. Our analysis also
demonstrates that Neptune's resonances impart a modest (few percent)
non-uniformity in the longitude of perihelion distribution of the currently

ranging from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantum device
characterization. A central challenge in this pursuit is the learning of
strongly-interacting systems, where conventional observables decay quickly in
time and space, limiting the information that can be learned from their
measurement. In this work, we introduce a new class of observables into the
context of quantum learning -- the out-of-time-order correlator -- which we
show can substantially improve the learnability of strongly-interacting systems
by virtue of displaying informative physics at large times and distances. We
identify two general scenarios in which out-of-time-order correlators provide a
significant advantage for learning tasks in locally-interacting systems: (i)
when experimental access to the system is spatially-restricted, for example via
a single ""probe"" degree of freedom, and (ii) when one desires to characterize
weak interactions whose strength is much less than the typical interaction
strength. We numerically characterize these advantages across a variety of
learning problems, and find that they are robust to both read-out error and
decoherence. Finally, we introduce a binary classification task that can be
accomplished in constant time with out-of-time-order measurements. In a
companion paper, we prove that this task is exponentially hard with any
adaptive learning protocol that only involves time-ordered operations.

Spectroscopic Survey (S5). For an accurate comparison between the stream
populations, we produce mock Dark Energy Survey (DES) observations of the FIRE
streams and estimate the detectability of their tidal tails and progenitors.
The number and stellar mass distributions of detectable stellar streams is
consistent between observations and simulations. However, there are
discrepancies in the distributions of pericenters and apocenters, with the
detectable FIRE streams, on average, forming at larger pericenters (out to >
110 kpc) and surviving only at larger apocenters (> 40 kpc) than those observed
in the Milky Way. We find that the population of high-stellar mass dwarf galaxy
streams in the Milky Way is incomplete. Interestingly, a large fraction of the
FIRE streams would only be detected as satellites in DES-like observations,
since their tidal tails are too low-surface brightness to be detectable. We
thus predict a population of yet-undetected tidal tails around Milky Way
satellites, as well as a population of fully undetected low surface brightness
stellar streams, and estimate their detectability with the Rubin Observatory.
Finally, we discuss the causes and implications of the discrepancies between
the stream populations in FIRE and the Milky Way, and explore future avenues

A
large fraction of close binaries are in triple systems, suggesting that their
formation may be associated with the Kozai-Lidov mechanism. However, this
picture remains under debate because the configurations of many observed
triples are unlikely to trigger the Kozai-Lidov mechanism. In this paper, we
use the close binary samples, including eclipsing, spectroscopic, and
astrometric binaries, from Gaia Data Release 3 to investigate the mysterious
connection between inner binaries and their wide tertiaries. We show that the
wide tertiary (at $10^3$-$10^4$ AU) fraction increases with decreasing orbital
periods of the inner binaries. The wide tertiary fraction of eclipsing binaries
(a median orbital period of $0.41$ day) is $2.33\pm0.11$ times higher than the
field wide binary fraction. Furthermore, there is a tentative excess at
$\sim10^4$ AU for tertiaries of eclipsing binaries. Using the $v$-$r$ angle
distributions, we show that wide tertiaries have isotropic orientations with
respect to the inner binaries, and the co-planar orbits can be ruled out. The
inferred eccentricity distribution of wide tertiaries is consistent
($<1\sigma$) with being thermal ($f(e)\propto e$), similar to wide binaries at
similar separations. The dynamical unfolding scenario is disfavored because it
predicts highly eccentric wide tertiaries, which is inconsistent with our
findings. For the Kozai-Lidov mechanism to be effective for wide tertiaries at
$>10^3$ AU, the initial separations of the inner binaries need to be $>3$ AU.
Future theoretical investigations are needed to explore the parameter space at
these large initial separations and large tertiary separations.

process known as non-resonant reacceleration. It is often invoked to explain
observed ratios of primary to secondary CRs at $\sim \rm GeV$ energies,
assuming wholly diffusive CR transport. However, such estimates ignore the
impact of CR self-confinement and streaming. We study these issues in stirring
box magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations using Athena++, with field-aligned
diffusive and streaming CR transport. For diffusion only, we find CR
reacceleration rates in good agreement with analytic predictions. When
streaming is included, reacceleration rates depend on plasma $\beta$. Due to
streaming-modified phase shifts between CR and gas variables, they are slower
than canonical reacceleration rates in low-$\beta$ environments like the
interstellar medium (ISM) but remain unchanged in high-$\beta$ environments
like the intracluster medium (ICM). We also quantify the streaming energy loss
rate in our simulations. For sub-Alfv\'{e}nic turbulence, it is
resolution-dependent (hence unconverged in large scale simulations) and heavily
suppressed -- by an order of magnitude -- compared to the isotropic loss rate
$v_{A} \cdot \nabla P_{\rm CR} / P_{\rm CR} \sim v_{A}/L_{0}$, due to
misalignment between the mean field and isotropic CR gradients.
Counterintuitively, and unlike acceleration efficiencies, CR losses are almost
independent of magnetic field strength over $\beta \sim 1-100$ and are,
therefore, not the primary factor behind lower acceleration rates when
streaming is included. While this paper is primarily concerned with how
turbulence affects CRs, in a follow-up paper (Bustard and Oh, in prep), we
consider how CRs affect turbulence by diverting energy from the MHD cascade,
altering the pathway to gas heating and steepening the turbulent power
spectrum.

signal excesses above backgrounds. Both the Brookhaven and the Fermilab muon
$g-2$ collaborations have measured values of this parameter which, while
consistent with each other, are in conflict with the SM. Recently, the CDF II
collaboration has reported a precision measurement of the $W$-boson mass that
is in strong conflict with the SM prediction. It is worthwhile to seek new
physics which may underly all four anomalies. In such a quest, the neutrino
experiments could play a crucial role, because once a common solution to these
anomalies is sought, LSND and MB, due to their highly restrictive requirements
and observed final states, help to greatly narrow the multiplicity of new
physics possibilities that are otherwise open to the $W$ mass and muon $g-2$
discrepancies. Pursuant to this, earlier work has shown that LSND, MB and the
muon $g-2$ results can be understood in the context of a scalar extension of
the SM which incorporates a second Higgs doublet and a dark sector singlet. We
show that the same model leads to a contribution to the $W$ mass which is
consistent with the recent CDF II measurement. While the LSND, MB fits and the
muon $g-2$ results help determine the masses of the light scalars in the model,
the calculation of the oblique parameters $S$ and $T$ determines the allowed
mass ranges of the heavier pseudoscalar and the charged Higgs bosons as well as
the effective Weinberg angle and its new range.

susceptible to tidal forces. The expected degree of disturbance depends on the
assumed gravity law and whether they have a dominant dark halo. This makes
dwarf galaxies useful for testing different gravity models. In this project, we
use the Fornax Deep Survey (FDS) dwarf galaxy catalogue to compare the
properties of dwarf galaxies in the Fornax Cluster with those predicted by the
Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) standard model of cosmology and
Milgromian dynamics (MOND). We construct a test particle simulation of the
Fornax system. We then use the MCMC method to fit this to the FDS distribution
of tidal susceptibility $\eta$ (half-mass radius divided by theoretical tidal
radius), the fraction of dwarfs that visually appear disturbed as a function of
$\eta$, and the distribution of projected separation from the cluster centre.
This allows us to constrain the $\eta$ value at which dwarfs should get
destroyed by tides. Accounting for an $r'$-band surface brightness limit of
27.8 magnitudes per square arcsec, the required stability threshold is
$\eta_{\textrm{destr}} = 0.25^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ in $\Lambda$CDM and $
1.88^{+0.85}_{-0.53}$ in MOND. The $\Lambda$CDM value is in tension with
previous $\textit{N}$-body dwarf galaxy simulations, which indicate that
$\eta_{\textrm{destr}} \approx 1$. Our MOND $\textit{N}$-body simulations
indicate that $\eta_{\textrm{destr}} = 1.70 \pm 0.30$, which agrees well with
our MCMC analysis of the FDS. We therefore conclude that the observed
deformations of dwarf galaxies in the Fornax Cluster and the lack of low
surface brightness dwarfs towards its centre are incompatible with $\Lambda$CDM
expectations but well consistent with MOND.

anomalous critical phenomena. The anomalous SPT exhibits a closing of the
energy gap with different critical exponents on both sides of transition and a
discontinuity of correlations and fluctuation despite it being a continuous

Moreover, we show that the nearest neighborhood complex hopping induces
effective long-range interactions for position quadratures of the cavity

among superradiant phases with varying degrees of frustration. The resulting
multicritical points also show anomalous features such as two coexisting

for strong jet formation. We next investigate the other possibility, where the
large-scale magnetic fields are advected inward from external sources (e.g. the
companion star in X-ray binaries, magnetized ambient medium in AGNs). Although
the actual configuration of the external fields could be complex and uncertain,
they are likely to be closed. As a first study, we treat them as closed field
loops of different sizes, shapes and field strengths. Unlike earlier studies of
flux transport, where magnetic flux is injected in the initial laminar flow, we
injected the magnetic field loops in the quasi-stationary turbulent RIAF in
inflow equilibrium and followed their evolution. We found that a substantial

injected at high latitudes, away from the mid-plane. Relatively high efficiency
of flux transport observed in our study hints that a MAD might be formed
relatively easily close to the BH, provided that a source of the large-scale

model incorporates the effects of dust grain production in asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) star winds and supernovae (SN), grain growth due to the accretion
of heavy elements from the gas phase of the interstellar medium (ISM), and
grain destruction due to thermal sputtering in the high temperature gas of
supernova remnants (SNRs). A main conclusion of our analysis is the importance
of a carefully chosen dust destruction model, for which different reasonable
parameterizations can predict very different values at the $\sim 100$ pc
resolution of the ISM in our simulations. We run this dust model on the single
most massive galaxy in a 10$h^{-1}$ co-moving Mpc box, which attains a stellar
mass of $\sim 2\times10^9 M_{\odot}$ by $z=5$. We find that the model is
capable of reproducing dust masses and dust-sensitive observable quantities
broadly consistent with existing data from high-redshift galaxies. The total
dust mass in the simulated galaxy is somewhat sensitive to parameter choices
for the dust model, especially the timescale for grain growth due to accretion

its straightforward classical evolution with a widening multidimensional

holds for the Glauber-Sundarshan P-function, which guarantees separability of
the components. In the multicomponent context, a full dissipation matrix is
defined, whereas its trace, equal to twice the previously derived dissipation
coefficient, governs the rate at which the phase space volume of the argument

electronic channels to which they couple) and the interimpurity RKKY
interactions (mediated by the same channels) has been extensively studied.
However, the effect of unidirectional channels (e.g., chiral or helical edge
modes of 2D topological materials) which greatly restrict the mediated
interimpurity interactions, has only more recently come under scrutiny, and it
can drastically alter the physics. Here we take Wilson's numerical
renormalization group (NRG), the most established numerical method for treating
quantum impurity models, and extend it to systems consisting of two impurities
coupled at different locations to unidirectional channel(s). This is
challenging due to the incompatibility of unidirectionality with one of the
main ingredients in NRG -- the mapping of the channel(s) to a Wilson chain -- a
tight-binding chain with the impurity at one end and hopping amplitudes which
decay exponentially with the distance. We bridge this gap by introducing a
""Wilson ladder"" consisting of two coupled Wilson chains, and demonstrate that
this construction successfully captures the unidirectionality of the
channel(s), as well as the distance between the two impurities. We use this
mapping in order to study two Kondo impurities coupled to a single chiral
channel, showing that all local properties and thermodynamic quantities are
indifferent to the interimpurity distance, and correspond to two separate
single-impurity models. Extensions to more impurities and/or helical channels
are possible.

millimeter-wave sky to unprecedented sensitivity, using 500,000 superconducting
detectors observing from Chile and Antarctica to map over 60 percent of the
sky. The fundamental building block of the detector and readout system is a
detector module package operated at 100 mK, which is connected to a readout and
amplification chain that carries signals out to room temperature. It uses
arrays of feedhorn-coupled orthomode transducers (OMT) that collect optical
power from the sky onto dc-voltage-biased transition-edge sensor (TES)
bolometers. The resulting current signal in the TESs is then amplified by a
two-stage cryogenic Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) system
with a time-division multiplexer to reduce wire count, and matching
room-temperature electronics to condition and transmit signals to the data
acquisition system. Sensitivity and systematics requirements are being
developed for the detector and readout system over a wide range of observing
bands (20 to 300 GHz) and optical powers to accomplish CMB-S4's science goals.
While the design incorporates the successes of previous generations of CMB
instruments, CMB-S4 requires an order of magnitude more detectors than any
prior experiment. This requires fabrication of complex superconducting circuits
on over 10 square meters of silicon, as well as significant amounts of
precision wiring, assembly and cryogenic testing.

a function of horizon radius is thoroughly studied to understand the thermal
stability of the black hole solution. An interesting phenomena of existence/
absence of thermal phase transition occur due to the nonlinearity of YM source.
For some values of the parameters, we find that the solution exhibits a
first-order phase transition, like a van der Waals fluid. In addition, we also
verify Maxwell's equal area law numerically by crucial analysis of Gibbs free
energy as a function of temperature. Moreover, the critical exponents are

learning models that gradually increases the hardness of the learning tasks

design of curricula -- i.e., in the sequential design of tasks that gradually
increase in difficulty. We propose Hierarchical Curriculum Learning (HiCu), an
algorithm that uses graph structure in the space of outputs to design curricula
for multi-label classification. We create curricula for multi-label
classification models that predict ICD diagnosis and procedure codes from
natural language descriptions of patients. By leveraging the hierarchy of ICD
codes, which groups diagnosis codes based on various organ systems in the human
body, we find that our proposed curricula improve the generalization of neural
network-based predictive models across recurrent, convolutional, and

  (PoPETs) 2023",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Federated learning (FL) has attracted growing interest for enabling
privacy-preserving machine learning on data stored at multiple users while
avoiding moving the data off-device. However, while data never leaves users'
devices, privacy still cannot be guaranteed since significant computations on
users' training data are shared in the form of trained local models. These
local models have recently been shown to pose a substantial privacy threat
through different privacy attacks such as model inversion attacks. As a remedy,
Secure Aggregation (SA) has been developed as a framework to preserve privacy
in FL, by guaranteeing the server can only learn the global aggregated model
update but not the individual model updates. While SA ensures no additional
information is leaked about the individual model update beyond the aggregated
model update, there are no formal guarantees on how much privacy FL with SA can
actually offer; as information about the individual dataset can still
potentially leak through the aggregated model computed at the server. In this
work, we perform a first analysis of the formal privacy guarantees for FL with
SA. Specifically, we use Mutual Information (MI) as a quantification metric and
derive upper bounds on how much information about each user's dataset can leak
through the aggregated model update. When using the FedSGD aggregation
algorithm, our theoretical bounds show that the amount of privacy leakage
reduces linearly with the number of users participating in FL with SA. To
validate our theoretical bounds, we use an MI Neural Estimator to empirically
evaluate the privacy leakage under different FL setups on both the MNIST and
CIFAR10 datasets. Our experiments verify our theoretical bounds for FedSGD,
which show a reduction in privacy leakage as the number of users and local
batch size grow, and an increase in privacy leakage with the number of training
rounds.

tube operation presents many challenges that may ultimately affect the quality
of chemical kinetics data. Numerous diaphragmless concepts have been developed
to overcome the drawbacks of using diaphragms. Most of these diaphragmless
designs require significant alterations in the driver section of the shock tube
and, in some cases, fail to match the performance of the diaphragm-mode of
operation. In the present work, an existing diaphragm-type shock tube is
retrofitted with a fast-acting valve, and the performance of the diaphragmless
shock tube is evaluated for investigating the ignition of methane and n-hexane.
The diaphragmless shock tube reported here presents many advantages, such as
eliminating the use of diaphragms, avoiding substantial manual effort during
experiments, automating the shock tube facility, having good control over
driver conditions, and obtaining good repeatability for reliable gas-phase
chemical kinetic studies. Ignition delay time measurements have been performed
in the diaphragmless shock tube for three methane mixtures and two n-hexane

defend against the adversaries, the existing malware detection based on machine

This can cause an additional overhead and can prolong the real-time malware

thesis is to address the above mentioned critical system security issues. The

framework that leverages the efficiency of sampling-based planning approaches,
and closes the manipulation loop by dynamically controlling the planning
horizon. Our approach interleaves planning and execution to progressively
approach the manipulation goal while correcting any errors or path deviations

robot to flexibly interact with all objects to facilitate the manipulation of

into tendril-like structures. In the ferroelectric nematic phase (NF) these
processes take place via the formation of conical spikes evolving into jet

from 3D micro-computed-tomography (micro-CT) scanned images. The accurate
computation of homogenized properties of rocks, archetypal random media,
requires both resolution of intricate underlying microstructure and large field
of view, resulting in huge micro-CT images. Homogenization entails solving the
local elasticity problem computationally which can be prohibitively expensive
for a huge image. To mitigate this problem, we use a renormalization method
inspired scheme, the hierarchical homogenization method, where a large image is
partitioned into smaller subimages. The individual subimages are separately
homogenized using periodic boundary conditions, and then assembled into a much
smaller intermediate image. The intermediate image is again homogenized,
subject to the periodic boundary condition, to find the final homogenized
elastic constant of the original image. An FFT-based elasticity solver is used
to solve the associated periodic elasticity problem. The error in the
homogenized elastic constant is empirically shown to follow a power law scaling
with exponent -1 with respect to the subimage size across all five
microstructures of rocks. We further show that the inclusion of surrounding
materials during the homogenization of the small subimages reduces error in the
final homogenized elastic moduli while still respecting the power law with the
exponent of -1. This power law scaling is then exploited to determine a better
approximation of the large heterogeneous microstructures based on Richardson
extrapolation

parameter changes is essential for many applications. This sensitivity may be
desired - for instance in the brain, where a large repertoire of different
dynamics, particularly different synchronization patterns, is crucial - or may
be undesired - for instance in power grids, where disruptions to
synchronization may lead to blackouts. In this work, we show that the dynamics
of networks of phase oscillators can acquire a very large and complex
sensitivity to changes made in either their units' parameters or in their
connections - even modifications made to a parameter of a single unit can
radically alter the global dynamics of the network in an unpredictable manner.
As a consequence, each modification leads to a different path to phase
synchronization manifested as large fluctuations along that path. This
dynamical malleability occurs over a wide parameter region, around the
network's two transitions to phase synchronization. One transition is induced
by increasing the coupling strength between the units, and another is induced
by increasing the prevalence of long-range connections. Specifically, we study
Kuramoto phase oscillators connected under either Watts-Strogatz or
distance-dependent topologies to analyze the statistical properties of the
fluctuations along the paths to phase synchrony. We argue that this increase in
the dynamical malleability is a general phenomenon, as suggested by both
previous studies and the theory of phase transitions.

(progenitor ages <2.5 Gyr), as well as those of the H II regions, to constrain
the chemical enrichment and star formation efficiency in the thin and thicker
discs of M31. The argon element is produced in larger fraction by Type Ia
supernovae (SNe) than oxygen. We find that the mean log(O/Ar) values of PNe as
a function of their argon abundances, 12 + log(Ar/H), trace the inter-stellar
matter (ISM) conditions at the time of birth of the M 31 disc PN progenitors.
Thus the chemical enrichment and star formation efficiency information encoded
in the [alpha/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] distribution of stars is also imprinted in the
oxygen-to-argon abundance ratio log(O/Ar) vs. argon abundance for the nebular
emissions of the different stellar evolution phases. We propose to use the
log(O/Ar) vs. (12 + log(Ar/H)) distribution of PNe with different ages to
constrain the star-formation histories of the parent stellar populations in the
thin and thicker M31 discs. For the inner M31 disc (R_{GC} < 14 kpc), the
chemical evolution model that reproduces the mean log(O/Ar) values as function
of argon abundance for the high- and low-extinction PNe requires a second
infall of metal poorer gas during a gas-rich (wet) satellite merger. In M31,
the thin disc is younger and less radially extended, formed stars at a higher
star formation efficiency, and had a faster chemical enrichment timescale than
the more extended, thicker disc. Both the thin and thicker disc in M31 reach
similar high argon abundances ( 12 + log(Ar/H) ) ~ 6.7. The chemical and
structural properties of the thin/thicker discs in M31 are thus remarkably
different from those determined for the Milky Way thin and thick discs.

blooms (HABs), which cause significant fish deaths in aquaculture farms. This
contributes to ocean pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions since dead
fish are either dumped into the ocean or taken to landfills, which in turn
negatively impacts the climate. Currently, the standard method to enumerate
harmful algae and other phytoplankton is to manually observe and count them
under a microscope. This is a time-consuming, tedious and error-prone process,
resulting in compromised management decisions by farmers. Hence, automating
this process for quick and accurate HAB monitoring is extremely helpful.
However, this requires large and diverse datasets of phytoplankton images, and
such datasets are hard to produce quickly. In this work, we explore the
feasibility of generating novel high-resolution photorealistic synthetic
phytoplankton images, containing multiple species in the same image, given a
small dataset of real images. To this end, we employ Generative Adversarial

architectures: ProjectedGAN, FastGAN, and StyleGANv2 using standard image
quality metrics. We empirically show the generation of high-fidelity synthetic
phytoplankton images using a training dataset of only 961 real images. Thus,
this work demonstrates the ability of GANs to create large synthetic datasets

sustainable systematic monitoring of harmful algal blooms.

most devastating defects in metal additive manufacturing. Due to the
interactive underlying physics involved, the computational simulation of such a
process is challenging. In this work, we propose a thermo-mechanical
phase-field fracture model, which is based on a thermodynamically consistent
derivation. The influence of different coupling terms such as damage-informed
thermomechanics and heat conduction and temperature-dependent fracture
properties, as well as different phase-field fracture formulations, are
discussed. Finally, the model is implemented in the finite element method and
applied to simulate the hot cracking in additive manufacturing. Thereby not
only the thermal strain but also the solidification shrinkage are considered.
As for thermal history, various predicted thermal profiles, including
analytical solution and numerical thermal temperature profile around the
melting pool, are regarded, whereas the latter includes the influence of
different process parameters. The studies reveal that the solidification
shrinkage strain takes a dominant role in the formation of the circumferential
crack, while the temperature gradient is mostly responsible for the central
crack. Process parameter study demonstrates further that a higher laser power
and slower scanning speed are favorable for keyhole mode hot cracking while a
lower laser power and quicker scanning speed tend to form the conduction mode
cracking. The numerical predictions of the hot cracking patterns are in good
agreement with similar experimental observations, showing the capability of the
model for further studies.

BaBiO$_3$. Our model includes the Bi $6s$ and O $2p_\sigma$ orbitals and
coupling to the Bi-O bond-stretching branch of optical phonons via modulations
of the Bi-O hopping integral. We simulate three-dimensional clusters of up to
4000 orbitals, with input model parameters taken from {\it ab initio}
electronic structure calculations and a phonon energy $\hbar\Omega_0 = 60$~meV.
Our results demonstrate that the coupling to the bond-stretching modes is
sufficient to reproduce the CDW transition in this system, despite a relatively
small dimensionless coupling. We also find that the transition deviates from
the weak-coupling Peierls' picture. This work demonstrates that off-diagonal
$e$-ph interactions in orbital space are vital in establishing the bismuthate
phase diagram.

$v$ with $f(v)=\emptyset$, $f\big{(}N(v)\big{)}=\{1,2\}$. An outer-independent
$2$-rainbow dominating function (OI$2$RD function) of $G$ is a $2$-rainbow
dominating function $f$ for which the set of all $v\in V(G)$ with
$f(v)=\emptyset$ is independent. The outer independent $2$-rainbow domination
number (OI$2$RD number) $\gamma_{oir2}(G)$ is the minimum weight of an OI$2$RD
function of $G$.
  In this paper, we first prove that $n/2$ is a lower bound on the OI$2$RD
number of a connected claw-free graph of order $n$ and characterize all such
graphs for which the equality holds, solving an open problem given in an
earlier paper. In addition, a study of this parameter for some graph products
is carried out. In particular, we give a closed (resp. an exact) formula for
the OI$2$RD number of rooted (resp. corona) product graphs and prove upper
bounds on this parameter for the Cartesian product and direct product of two
graphs.

Differential cross sections are extracted in energy and angle with respect to

section as a function of proton energy is measured using events with protons
both above and below the visibility threshold. This is done by including a
separate selection of electron neutrino events without reconstructed proton

physics problem. Although it is well known that magnetic reconnection and
turbulence are coupled and transport energy from system-size scales to
sub-proton scales, the details of the energy distribution and energy
dissipation channels remain poorly understood. Especially, the energy transfer
and transport associated with three dimensional (3D) small-scale reconnection
that occurs as a consequence of a turbulent cascade is unknown. We use an
explicit fully kinetic particle-in-cell code to simulate 3D small scale
magnetic reconnection events forming in anisotropic and Alfv\'enic decaying
turbulence. We identify a highly dynamic and asymmetric reconnection event that
involves two reconnecting flux ropes. We use a two-fluid approach based on the
Boltzmann equation to study the spatial energy transfer associated with the
reconnection event and compare the power density terms in the two-fluid energy
equations with standard energy-based damping, heating and dissipation proxies.
Our findings suggest that the electron bulk flow transports thermal energy
density more efficiently than kinetic energy density. Moreover, in our
turbulent reconnection event, the energy-density transfer is dominated by
plasma compression. This is consistent with turbulent current sheets and
turbulent reconnection events, but not with laminar reconnection.

observe substantial non-conservation of the parallel adiabatic invariant which
can cause losses through diffusive banana tip motion. Furthermore, many lost
trajectories undergo transitions between trapping classes on longer time
scales, either with periodic or irregular behavior. We discuss possible
optimization strategies for each of the relevant transport mechanisms. We
perform a comparison between fast ion losses and metrics for the prevalence of

gradient of a non-Darcian flow; however, the supporting data is very limited.
In this study we for the first time report a systematic measurement of the

results show that a higher temperature leads to a lower threshold pressure
gradient under the same permeability and a faster reduction of the threshold
pressure gradient with increasing permeability. The experimental data are

expected from the decay of the particles. Assuming that the energy density of
these super-heavy particles matches that of dark matter observed today, we
translate the upper bounds on the particle fluxes into tight constraints on the
couplings governing the decay process as a function of the particle mass.
Instantons, which are non-perturbative solutions to Yang-Mills equations, can
give rise to decay channels otherwise forbidden and transform stable particles
into meta-stable ones. Assuming such instanton-induced decay processes, we
derive a bound on the reduced coupling constant of gauge interactions in the
dark sector: $\alpha_X \lesssim 0.09$, for $10^{9} \lesssim M_X/\text{GeV} <
10^{19}$. Conversely, we obtain that, for instance, a reduced coupling constant
$\alpha_X = 0.09$ excludes masses $M_X \gtrsim 3\times 10^{13}~$GeV. In the
context of dark matter production from gravitational interactions alone during
the reheating epoch, we derive constraints on the parameter space that
involves, in addition to $M_X$ and $\alpha_X$, the Hubble rate at the end of
inflation, the reheating efficiency, and the non-minimal coupling of the Higgs
with curvature.

one to relate the complicated scattering dynamics underlying the

$\tau$. Our approach reproduces the behaviors of the demagnetization time
$\tau_{m} \propto 1/\tau$ and $\tau_{m} \propto \tau$ for the limits of short

The ansatz thus provides a tool to include the correct demagnetization behavior

binary mergers can be produced by outflows from the black hole-accretion disk
remnant during the first ten seconds after the merger. Two-dimensional
axisymmetric simulations with effective viscosity remain an efficient and
informative way to model this late-time post-merger evolution. In addition to
the inherent approximations of axisymmetry and modeling turbulent angular
momentum transport by a viscosity, previous simulations often make other
simplifications related to the treatment of the equation of state and turbulent
transport effects.

the same viscosity the exact post-merger initial configuration previously
evolved in Newtonian viscous hydrodynamics, we find that the Newtonian
treatment provides a good estimate of the disk ejecta mass but underestimates
the outflow velocity. We find that the inclusion of heavy nuclei causes a
notable increase in ejecta mass. An approximate inclusion of r-process effects
has a comparatively smaller effect, except for its designed effect on the
composition. Diffusion of composition and entropy, modeling turbulent transport
effects, has the overall effect of reducing ejecta mass and giving it a speed
with lower average and more tightly-peaked distribution. Also, we find
significant acceleration of outflow even at distances beyond 10,000\,km, so
that thermal wind velocities only asymptote beyond this radius and at somewhat
higher values than previously reported.

transfer payments from insurers with healthier enrollees. Our goal is to
understand the elements driving risk transfers. First, the distribution of risk
transfers should be based on random health shocks, which are unpredictable
events that negatively affect health status. Second, risk transfers could be
influenced by factors unique to each insurer, such as certain plans attracting
certain patients, the extent to which carriers engage in risk selection, and
the degree of upcoding. We create a publicly available dataset using Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services data that includes insurer risk transfer
payments, costs, and premiums for the 2014-2017 benefit years. Using this

not consistent with the lack of risk selection as measured by the ACA risk
transfer formula. Over all states included in our dataset, at least 60% of the
volume of transfers cannot be accounted for by a purely normal model. Because

natural thermal reservoir and an external coherent drive in the limit where its
upper energy level can be adiabatically eliminated from the dynamics. In this
scenario, the drive plus spontaneous emission optically pumps the intermediate
energy level of the qutrit and the battery can be understood as being charged
by an effective higher temperature reservoir that takes it out of equilibrium
with the natural reservoir and stores useful energy in it. We also analyse the
efficiency of using this battery and charging scheme as the work fluid of a
two-stroke thermal machine. The thermal machine includes a fourth level through
which work is extracted from the battery via a unitary transformation,
therefore setting the limit of maximum efficiency of the machine.

accuracy is crucial for atomistic simulations. Commonly used potentials, such
as those constructed through the embedded atom method (EAM), are derived from
semi-empirical considerations and contain unknown parameters that must be
fitted based on training data. In the present work, we investigate Bayesian
calibration as a means of fitting EAM potentials for binary alloys. The
Bayesian setting naturally assimilates probabilistic assertions about uncertain
quantities. In this way, uncertainties about model parameters and model errors
can be updated by conditioning on the training data and then carried through to
prediction. We apply these techniques to investigate an EAM potential for a
family of gold-copper systems in which the training data correspond to
density-functional theory values for lattice parameters, mixing enthalpies, and
various elastic constants. Through the use of predictive distributions, we
demonstrate the limitations of the potential and highlight the importance of
statistical formulations for model error.

been proposed to deal with such situations by training agents under different
environmental setups, and therefore they can be generalized to different
environments during deployment. However, they usually do not incorporate the
underlying environmental factor information that the agents interact with
properly and thus can be overly conservative when facing changes in the
surroundings. In this paper, we first formalize the task of adapting to
changing environmental dynamics in RL as a generalization problem using
Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs). We then propose the Asymmetric
Actor-Critic in Contextual RL (AACC) as an end-to-end actor-critic method to

Early-stopping is critical for performance, halting model training when it
reaches optimal generalization to the new task distribution. Early-stopping
mechanisms in Meta-Learning typically rely on measuring the model performance
on labeled examples from a meta-validation set drawn from the training (source)
dataset. This is problematic in few-shot transfer learning settings, where the
meta-test set comes from a different target dataset (OOD) and can potentially
have a large distributional shift with the meta-validation set. In this work,
we propose Activation Based Early-stopping (ABE), an alternative to using
validation-based early-stopping for meta-learning. Specifically, we analyze the
evolution, during meta-training, of the neural activations at each hidden
layer, on a small set of unlabelled support examples from a single task of the
target tasks distribution, as this constitutes a minimal and justifiably
accessible information from the target problem. Our experiments show that
simple, label agnostic statistics on the activations offer an effective way to
estimate how the target generalization evolves over time. At each hidden layer,
we characterize the activation distributions, from their first and second order
moments, then further summarized along the feature dimensions, resulting in a
compact yet intuitive characterization in a four-dimensional space. Detecting
when, throughout training time, and at which layer, the target activation
trajectory diverges from the activation trajectory of the source data, allows
us to perform early-stopping and improve generalization in a large array of
few-shot transfer learning settings, across different algorithms, source and

estimate the solar spectrum between 0.5 keV and 10 keV based on the F10.7

the quiescent sun contribution to the spectra and is essentially independent of
solar activity, meaning the daily average quiescent sun is accurately described

represent active region contributions to the spectra and varies between 5 MK to
6 MK. GOES XRS-B data between 1-8 Angstroms is used to validate this model and
it is found that the ratio between the SWM model irradiance and the GOES XRS-B

leads to a coupled system of N interacting $\Phi^4$ equations. In d = 2, we
show uniform in N bounds for the dynamics and convergence to a mean-field
singular SPDE. For large enough mass or small enough coupling, the invariant
measures (i.e. the O(N) linear sigma model) converge to the massive Gaussian
free field, the unique invariant measure of the mean-field dynamics, in a
Wasserstein distance. We also obtain tightness for certain O(N) invariant
observables as random fields in suitable Besov spaces as $N\to \infty$, along
with exact descriptions of the limiting correlations. In d = 3, the estimates
become more involved since the equation is more singular. We discuss in this

these results build on the recent progress of singular SPDE theory and combine
many new techniques such as uniform in N estimates and dynamical mean field

We reproduce the intensity profile with a random mixture of five- and

test the robustness of the analysis carried out previously, as well as to
confirm the two most intriguing results of this investigation: evidence of very
high solar metallicities, and deviation of the relative abundance of elements

in three regions of the spectra centered at 1900, 1550 and 1400 A in order to
deblend the broad components of AlIII1860, CIII]1909, CIV1549, HeII1640, and
SiIV1397+OIV]1402 and their blue excess. By comparing the observed flux ratios
of these components with the same ratios predicted by photoionization code
CLOUDY we found that the virialized gas (broad components) presents a
metallicity Z higher than 10Z$_\odot$. For non-virialized clouds we derive a
lower limit to the metallicity around $\sim$ 5Z$_\odot$ under the assumption of
chemical composition proportional to the solar one, confirming the previous
results. We especially rely on the ratios between metal lines and HeII1640.
This allowed us to confirm systematic differences in the solar-scaled
metallicity derived from the lines of Aluminium and Silicon, and of Carbon,
with the first being a factor 2 higher. For luminous quasars accreting at high
rates, high Z values are likely, but that Z scaled values are affected by the
possible pollution due to highly-enriched gas associated with the circumnuclear
star formation. The high-Z values suggest a complex process involving nuclear
and circumnuclear star formation, interaction between nuclear compact objects
and accretion disk, possibly with the formation of accretion-modified stars.

given by the Fokker-Planck equation, which is an advection-diffusion equation.
A large hyperbolic operator, the Vlasov operator with the particle trajectories
as its characteristics, equals a small diffusive operator, the collision
operator. The collisionless particle trajectories would be chaotic in
stellarators without careful optimization. This would lead to rapid entropy
production and transport -- far beyond what is consistent with a
self-sustaining DT burn. Omnigeneity is the weakest general condition that is
consistent with a sufficiently small entropy production associated with the
thermal particle trajectories. Omnigeneity requires that the contours of
constant magnetic field strength be unbounded in at least one of the two
angular coordinates in magnetic surfaces and that there be a symmetry in the
field-strength wells along the field lines. Even in omnigenous plasmas,
fluctuations due to microturbulence can produce chaotic particle trajectories
and the gyro-Bohm transport seen in many stellarator and tokamak experiments.
The higher the plasma temperature above 10~keV, the smaller the transport must
be compared to gyro-Bohm for a self-sustaining DT burn. The hot alphas of DT
fusion heat the electrons. When the ion-electron equilibration time is long
compared to the ion energy confinement time, a self-sustaining DT burn is not
possible, which sets a limit on the electron temperature.

Continuous data collection using a vehicle-mounted sensing kit combined with

summed to correlate with grape yield. Conversely, regression models were
trained end-to-end to predict grape yield from image data without the need for

Specifically, we apply these five detectors at individual EEG channels to
distinguish artifacts from background EEG. Next, for each of these five types

artifacts in multi-channel EEG segments. These segment-level classifiers can
detect specific artifacts with a balanced accuracy (BAC) of 0.947, 0.735,

their formation, are an essential part of binary population synthesis (BPS)
models. Although these kicks are well-supported by evidence, their underlying
distributions and incorporation into BPS models is uncertain. In this work, we
investigate the nature of natal kicks using a previously proposed analytical
prescription where the strength of the kick is given by
$v_\text{k}=\alpha\frac{m_\text{ejecta}}{m_\text{remnant}}+\beta~\text{km
s}^{-1}$, for free parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We vary the free parameters
over large ranges of possible values, comparing these synthetic populations
simultaneously against four constraints: the merger rate of compact binary
neutron star (BNS) systems, the period-eccentricity distribution of galactic
BNSs, the velocity distribution of single-star pulsars, and the likelihood for
low-ejecta mass supernovae to produce low-velocity kicks. We find that
different samples of the parameter space satisfy each tests, and only 1 per
cent of the models satisfy all four constraints simultaneously. Although we
cannot identify a single best kick model, we report
$\alpha=115^{+40}_{-55}~\text{km s}^{-1}, \beta=15^{+10}_{-15}~\text{km

our constraints, and expect $\beta\geq0~\text{km s}^{-1}$ as a further
constraint. We also suggest further observations that will enable future
refinement of the kick model. A sensitive test for the kick model will be the
redshift evolution of the BNS merger rate since this is effectively a direct
measure of the delay-time distribution for mergers. For our best fitting
values, we find that the peak of the BNS merger rate is the present-day.

time-consuming; as a result, a limited number of annotated images are
available. This paper presents a semi-supervised method that leverages
unlabeled images and labeled ones to train a model that detects diabetic

self-supervised learning followed by supervised fine-tuning with a small set of
labeled images and knowledge distillation to increase the performance in

Besides, with proper choices of the design parameters, the tracking performance

recognition models, we propose a 'Relation Module' which can simply add-on to
any face recognition models. The local features extracted from face image
contain information of each component of the face. Based on two different
domain characteristics, to use the relationships between local features is more
domain-invariant than to use it as it is. In addition to these relationships,
positional information such as distance from lips to chin or eye to eye, also
provides domain-invariant information. In our Relation Module, Relation Layer
implicitly captures relationships, and Coordinates Layer models the positional
information. Also, our proposed Triplet loss with conditional margin reduces
intra-class variation in training, and resulting in additional performance
improvements. Different from the general face recognition models, our add-on
module does not need to pre-train with the large scale dataset. The proposed
module fine-tuned only with CASIA NIR-VIS 2.0 database. With the proposed

idea is illustrated by a concrete example of $\mathrm{VSi_2P_4}$ monolayer. The
increasing electric field can induce a transition of MA from in-plane to
out-of-plane by changing magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) from negative to
positive value, which is mainly due to increasing magnetocrystalline anisotropy
(MCA) energy. The out-of-plane magnetization is in favour of spontaneous valley
polarization in $\mathrm{VSi_2P_4}$. Within considered electric field range,
$\mathrm{VSi_2P_4}$ is always ferromagnetic (FM) ground state. In a certain

algorithms. It also offers a new and unified perspective into the problem of
adversarial vulnerability. Experimental results over MNIST and CIFAR-10

backgrounds has been becoming more and more essential. Several efforts have
been devoted to utilizing the deep learning-based approach to tackle the pill
recognition problem in the literature. However, due to the high similarity
between pills' appearance, misrecognition often occurs, leaving pill
recognition a challenge. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a novel
approach named PIKA that leverages external knowledge to enhance pill
recognition accuracy. Specifically, we address a practical scenario (which we
call contextual pill recognition), aiming to identify pills in a picture of a
patient's pill intake. Firstly, we propose a novel method for modeling the
implicit association between pills in the presence of an external data source,
in this case, prescriptions. Secondly, we present a walk-based graph embedding
model that transforms from the graph space to vector space and extracts
condensed relational features of the pills. Thirdly, a final framework is
provided that leverages both image-based visual and graph-based relational
features to accomplish the pill identification task. Within this framework, the
visual representation of each pill is mapped to the graph embedding space,
which is then used to execute attention over the graph representation,
resulting in a semantically-rich context vector that aids in the final
classification. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use external
prescription data to establish associations between medicines and to classify
them using this aiding information. The architecture of PIKA is lightweight and
has the flexibility to incorporate into any recognition backbones. The
experimental results show that by leveraging the external knowledge graph, PIKA
can improve the recognition accuracy from 4.8% to 34.1% in terms of F1-score,
compared to baselines.

rollout traces using the learnt dynamics model to reduce interactions with the
real environment. The recent model-based RL method considers the way to learn a
backward model that specifies the conditional probability of the previous state
given the previous action and the current state to additionally generate
backward rollout trajectories. However, in this type of model-based method, the
samples derived from backward rollouts and those from forward rollouts are
simply aggregated together to optimize the policy via the model-free RL
algorithm, which may decrease both the sample efficiency and the convergence
rate. This is because such an approach ignores the fact that backward rollout
traces are often generated starting from some high-value states and are
certainly more instructive for the agent to improve the behavior. In this
paper, we propose the backward imitation and forward reinforcement learning
(BIFRL) framework where the agent treats backward rollout traces as expert
demonstrations for the imitation of excellent behaviors, and then collects
forward rollout transitions for policy reinforcement. Consequently, BIFRL
empowers the agent to both reach to and explore from high-value states in a
more efficient manner, and further reduces the real interactions, making it
potentially more suitable for real-robot learning. Moreover, a
value-regularized generative adversarial network is introduced to augment the
valuable states which are infrequently received by the agent. Theoretically, we
provide the condition where BIFRL is superior to the baseline methods.
Experimentally, we demonstrate that BIFRL acquires the better sample efficiency
and produces the competitive asymptotic performance on various MuJoCo
locomotion tasks compared against state-of-the-art model-based methods.

rely on restrictive assumptions, fail to preserve topological properties within

introduce the node copying model for constructing a distribution over graphs.
Sampling of a random graph is carried out by replacing each node's neighbors by
those of a randomly sampled similar node. The sampled graphs preserve key
characteristics of the graph structure without explicitly targeting them.
Additionally, sampling from this model is extremely simple and scales linearly
with the nodes. We show the usefulness of the copying model in three tasks.
First, in node classification, a Bayesian formulation based on node copying
achieves higher accuracy in sparse data settings. Second, we employ our

the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods demonstrate notable

this issue, we propose a double-level deep reinforcement learning (DL-DRL)

task scheduling of multi-UAV into task allocation and route planning.
Particularly, we design an encoder-decoder structured policy network in our

another attention based policy network in our lower-level DRL model to
construct the route for each UAV, with the objective to maximize the number of

train the two models, we design an interactive training strategy (ITS), which
includes pre-training, intensive training and alternate training. Experimental
results show that our DL-DRL performs favorably against the learning-based and
conventional baselines including the OR-Tools, in terms of solution quality and
computation efficiency. We also verify the generalization performance of our
approach by applying it to larger sizes of up to 1000 tasks. Moreover, we also
show via an ablation study that our ITS can help achieve a balance between the

and spectral features to reveal the regularity behind the random variation. It
is known that quasar's FeII/Hbeta flux ratio and equivalent width of [OIII]5007
are negatively correlated, called Eigenvector 1. In this work, we visualized
the relationship between the position on this Eigenvector 1 (EV1) plane and how
they had changed their brightness after ~10 years. We conducted three analyses
using different quasar samples each. The first analysis showed the relation
between their distributions on the EV1 plane and how much they had changed
brightness, using 13,438 Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars. This result shows
how brightness changes later are clearly related to the position on the EV1
plane. In the second analysis, we plotted the sources reported as
Changing-Look(State) Quasars on the EV1 plane. This result shows that the
position on the EV1 plane corresponds activity level of each source, the bright
or dim state of them are distributed on the opposite sides divided by the
typical quasar distribution. In the third analysis, we examined the transition
vectors on the EV1 plane using sources with multiple-epoch spectra. This result
shows that the brightening and dimming sources move on the similar path and
they turn into the position corresponding to the opposite activity level. We
also found this trend is opposite to the empirical rule that RFeII positively
correlated with the Eddington ratio, which has been proposed based on the
trends of a large number of quasars. From all these analyses, it is indicated
that quasars tend to oscillate between both sides of the distribution ridge on
the EV1 plane; each of them corresponds to a dim state and a bright state. This
trend in optical variation suggests that significant brightness changes, such
as Changing-Look quasars, are expected to repeat.

constructed, in which 927 valid identities with 463,259 frames and 21,863

video-to-video matching in RGB-IR person Re-ID. Additionally, a novel method is
further proposed, which not only projects two modalities to a modal-invariant

these two strategies, much better results are achieved on our video-based

study investigates the perceived source expertise-product attribute congruence
and sponsorship disclosure as pertinent factors affecting the communicative
effectiveness of influencers. Instagram, with an immense influencer market
value projected at USD2.3 billion in 2020, was chosen as the platform context.
The study utilised a 2 (source expertise) x2 (product category) x2 (sponsorship
disclosure) experiment to examine the roles of source-product congruence and
sponsorship disclosure in affecting consumers' perception of extrinsic and
intrinsic source motives, consumer resistance and ultimately, advertising
effectiveness. Results revealed that the presence of a sponsorship disclosure
generated stronger perceptions of extrinsic source motives but did not impact
consumer resistance and advertising effectiveness, indicating that the
activation of consumers' conceptual persuasion knowledge may not necessarily
affect attitudinal persuasion knowledge. Source-product congruence, on the
other hand, had main impacts on intrinsic motives, consumer resistance and ad
effectiveness. In addition, hierarchical multiple regressions found that
source-product congruence triggers a multi-stage process where consumers'
perception of intrinsic source motives mediates consumer resistance which
subsequently, mediates the relationship between source-product congruence and
ad effectiveness.

has led to an increased consciousness about the privacy and security risks that
these systems pose. On the one hand, we want these systems to assist in our

them to do so without capturing any sensitive information. Towards this
direction, this paper proposes a simple, yet robust privacy-preserving encoder
called BDQ for the task of privacy-preserving human action recognition that is
composed of three modules: Blur, Difference, and Quantization. First, the input
scene is passed to the Blur module to smoothen the edges. This is followed by
the Difference module to apply a pixel-wise intensity subtraction between
consecutive frames to highlight motion features and suppress obvious high-level
privacy attributes. Finally, the Quantization module is applied to the motion
difference frames to remove the low-level privacy attributes. The BDQ
parameters are optimized in an end-to-end fashion via adversarial training such
that it learns to allow action recognition attributes while inhibiting privacy
attributes. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed
encoder design can achieve state-of-the-art trade-off when compared with
previous works. Furthermore, we show that the trade-off achieved is at par with
the DVS sensor-based event cameras. Code available at:

challenges, we propose an extremely low-latency VSR algorithm based on a novel
kernel knowledge transfer method, named convolutional kernel bypass graft
(CKBG). First, we design a lightweight network structure that does not require
future frames as inputs and saves extra time costs for caching these frames.
Then, our proposed CKBG method enhances this lightweight base model by
bypassing the original network with ``kernel grafts'', which are extra
convolutional kernels containing the prior knowledge of external pretrained
image SR models. In the testing phase, we further accelerate the grafted
multi-branch network by converting it into a simple single-path structure.
Experiment results show that our proposed method can process online video

(mmWave) spectra, it would become much more feasible to implement a joint radar
and communication system by extending communication frequencies into the mmWave
band. In this paper, an IEEE 802.11ad waveform-based radar imaging technique is
proposed for vehicular settings. A roadside unit (RSU) transmits the IEEE
802.11ad waveform to a vehicle for communications while the RSU also listens to
the echoes of transmitted waveform to perform inverse synthetic aperture radar
(ISAR) imaging. To obtain high-resolution images of the vehicle, the RSU needs
to accurately estimate round-trip delays, Doppler shifts, and velocity of
vehicle. The proposed ISAR imaging first estimates the round-trip delays using
a good correlation property of Golay complementary sequences in the IEEE
802.11ad preamble. The Doppler shifts are then obtained using least square
estimation from the echo signals and refined to compensate phase wrapping
caused by phase rotation. The velocity of vehicle is determined using an
equation of motion and the estimated Doppler shifts. Simulation results verify
that the proposed technique is able to form high-resolution ISAR images from
point scatterer models of realistic vehicular settings with different
viewpoints. The proposed ISAR imaging technique can be used for various
vehicular applications, e.g., traffic condition analyses or advanced collision
warning systems.

advantageous. CFAR is less understood in these settings. To close this gap, we
introduce a framework of CFAR constrained detectors. Theoretically, we prove
that a CFAR constrained Bayes optimal detector is asymptotically equivalent to

a deep learning framework for fitting neural networks that approximate it.
Experiments in both model based target detection and data-driven hyper-spectral

probability estimation for computational models of an engineering product or a
process returning categorical information only, for example, either success or
failure. For such models, most of the methods designed for the estimation of
failure probability, which use the numerical value of the outcome to compute
gradients or to estimate the proximity to the failure surface, cannot be
applied. Even if the performance function provides more than just binary
output, the state of the system may be a non-smooth or even a discontinuous
function defined in the domain of continuous input variables. In these cases,
the classical gradient-based methods usually fail. We propose a simple yet
efficient algorithm, which performs a sequential adaptive selection of points
from the input domain of random variables to extend and refine a simple
distance-based surrogate model. Two different tasks can be accomplished at any
stage of sequential sampling: (i) estimation of the failure probability, and
(ii) selection of the best possible candidate for the subsequent model
evaluation if further improvement is necessary. The proposed criterion for
selecting the next point for model evaluation maximizes the expected
probability classified by using the candidate. Therefore, the perfect balance
between global exploration and local exploitation is maintained automatically.
The method can estimate the probabilities of multiple failure types. Moreover,
when the numerical value of model evaluation can be used to build a smooth
surrogate, the algorithm can accommodate this information to increase the
accuracy of the estimated probabilities. Lastly, we define a new simple yet
general geometrical measure of the global sensitivity of the rare-event
probability to individual variables, which is obtained as a by-product of the

transmission, which significantly increase the training overhead for fine beam
alignment. The concept of using out-of-band spatial information to aid mmWave
beam search is developed when multi-band systems operating in parallel. The
feasibility of leveraging low-band channel information for coarse estimation of
high-band beam directions strongly depends on the spatial congruence between
two frequency bands. In this paper, we try to provide insights into the answers
of two important questions. First, how similar is the power angular spectra
(PAS) of radio channels between two well-separated frequency bands? Then, what
is the impact of practical system configurations on spatial channel similarity?
Specifically, the beam direction-based metric is proposed to measure the power
loss and number of false directions if out-of-band spatial information is used
instead of in-band information. This metric is more practical and useful than
comparing normalized PAS directly. Point cloud ray-tracing and measurement
results across multiple frequency bands and environments show that the degree
of spatial similarity of beamformed channels is related to antenna beamwidth,
frequency gap, and radio link conditions.

Adaptive dynamics of ZD strategies further reveals the unforeseen connection

growth behavior of the surface elevation variance transitions from linear
growth to exponential growth. Moreover, surface waves exhibit nonlinearity at
the late stage of simulation when the wave amplitude is significant enough to
alter the airflow field. Based on this rich DNS dataset, we systematically
study the underlying mechanism and report several advances in the theoretical
analysis of this problem.

According to our assessment, most mobile apps in the app stores do not satisfy
the overall requirements for tracking food consumption and recommendations.
""Foodvisor"" is the only app that can automatically recognize food items, and

obtain that among 21070 simulated flares, 813 events endure over 50 seconds,
scaled with the temporal resolution of the Yohkoh Hard X-ray Telescope, and
about 70 percent of these rather long-lasting events exhibit QPPs. We also
illustrate that the applied CA model provides a wide range of periodicities for
QPPs. Furthermore, we observe the presence of multiple periods in nearly 50
percent of the cases applying the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. A lognormal
distribution is fitted to the unimodal distribution of the periods as a
manifestation of an underlying multiplicative mechanism that typifies the
effect of the system's independent varying parameters. The global maximum of
the periods' lognormal distribution is located at 29.29 seconds. We compare
statistics of the simulated QPPs with parameters of the host flares and discuss
the impacts of flare properties on QPPs' periods. Considering the intrinsic
characteristic of CA models, namely the repetitive load/unload mechanism, and
the obtained pieces of evidence, we suggest that CA models may generate QPPs.
We also examine the applicability of the autoregressive integrated moving

question -- why do these misconfigurations occur and, specifically, whether
usability of security controls plays a part? To date, the usability of
configuring PLC security mechanisms has not been studied. We present the first

We find that the use of unfamiliar labels, layouts and misleading terminology
exacerbates an already complex process of configuring security mechanisms. Our
results uncover various (mis-) perceptions about the security controls and how
design constraints, e.g., safety and lack of regular updates (due to long term
nature of such systems), provide significant challenges to realization of

protoplanetary disks. The magnetic fields in the disk are stretched to the
azimuthal directions, and cosmic rays need to detour while propagating to the

the midplane ionization rate is very low for $r\lesssim\,100$ au, while the

consistent with the recent ALMA observation that indicates the radial gradient

grows with the number of travelers and the degree (capacity of the vehicle to
perform a pooled ride) and quickly explodes to the sizes making the problem not
solvable analytically. In practice, heuristics are applied to limit the number
of searches, e.g., maximal detour and delay, or (like we use in this study)
attractive rides (for which detour and delay are at least compensated with the
discount).
  Nevertheless, the challenge to solve the ride-pooling remains strongly
sensitive to the problem settings. Here, we explore it in more detail and
provide an experimental underpinning to this open research problem. We trace
how the size of the search space and computation time needed to solve the
ride-pooling problem grows with the increasing demand and greater discounts
offered for pooling. We run over 100 practical experiments in Amsterdam with
10-minute batches of trip requests up to 3600 trips per hour and trace how
challenging it is to propose the solution to the pooling problem with our ExMAS
algorithm.
  We observed strong, non-linear trends and identified the limits beyond which
the problem exploded and our algorithm failed to compute. Notably, we found
that the demand level (number of trip requests) is less critical than the
discount. The search space grows exponentially and quickly reaches huge levels.
However, beyond some level, the greater size of the ride-pooling problem does
not translate into greater efficiency of pooling. Which opens the opportunity
for further search space reductions.

effects with the MoSe$_2$ indirect band gap. By comparing the experimental
results with the two-phonon density of states calculated with density
functional theory, we show that the high-order modes originate mostly from
two-phonon modes with opposite momenta. In particular, we identify the momenta

Learning (FL), nodes are orders of magnitude more constrained than traditional
server-grade hardware and are often battery powered, severely limiting the
sophistication of models that can be trained under this paradigm. While most
research has focused on designing better aggregation strategies to improve
convergence rates and in alleviating the communication costs of FL, fewer
efforts have been devoted to accelerating on-device training. Such stage, which
repeats hundreds of times (i.e. every round) and can involve thousands of
devices, accounts for the majority of the time required to train federated
models and, the totality of the energy consumption at the client side. In this
work, we present the first study on the unique aspects that arise when
introducing sparsity at training time in FL workloads. We then propose ZeroFL,
a framework that relies on highly sparse operations to accelerate on-device

""chirped"" since both the exoplanet and the Earth are moving. Such planet
rotation and orbital revolution around the central star can cause a non-zero

by the rotations and orbits of the Earth and exoplanet in celestial mechanics

one. We can obtain the expected pseudosinusoidal drifting result with long-term

should be intermittent pseudosinusoidal curves in long-term observations. The

frameworks relax this dependency by first learning from unlabelled images. In
this work we show that pretraining with two contrastive methods, SimCLR and
BYOL, improves the utility of deep learning with regard to the clinical
assessment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In experiments using two
large clinical datasets containing 170,427 optical coherence tomography (OCT)
images of 7,912 patients, we evaluate benefits attributed to pretraining across
seven downstream tasks ranging from AMD stage and type classification to
prediction of functional endpoints to segmentation of retinal layers, finding
performance significantly increased in six out of seven tasks with fewer
labels. However, standard contrastive frameworks have two known weaknesses that
are detrimental to pretraining in the medical domain. Several of the image
transformations used to create positive contrastive pairs are not applicable to
greyscale medical scans. Furthermore, medical images often depict the same
anatomical region and disease severity, resulting in numerous misleading
negative pairs. To address these issues we develop a novel metadata-enhanced
approach that exploits the rich set of inherently available patient

further benefits and outperforms conventional contrastive methods in five out

possible applications. The basic phenomenology, a strongly asymmetric
magnetoresistance despite the absence of magnetism, is now understood to result
from the combination of spin-orbit coupling and chiral geometry. However,
experimental signatures of electronic helicity were observed at room
temperature, i.e., at an energy scale that exceeds the typical spin-orbit
coupling in organic systems by several orders of magnitude. This work shows
that a new energy scale for CISS emerges for currents carried by polarons,
i.e., in the presence of strong electron-phonon coupling. In particular, we
found that polaron fluctuations play a crucial role in the two manifestations
of CISS in transport measurements -- the spin-dependent transmission
probability through the system and asymmetric magnetoresistance.

GANs adopt estimators like REINFORCE or continuous relaxations to model word

in previous attempts. Our analyses reveal that invalid sampling methods and
unhealthy gradients are the main contributors to such unsatisfactory
performance. In this work, we present two techniques to tackle these problems:
dropout sampling and fully normalized LSTM. Based on these two techniques, we
propose InitialGAN whose parameters are randomly initialized in full. Besides,
we introduce a new evaluation metric, Least Coverage Rate, to better evaluate
the quality of generated samples. The experimental results demonstrate that
InitialGAN outperforms both MLE and other compared models. To the best of our

of quantum decoherence. Such dissipative effects are caused by the interaction
of the system with its environment and lead to a loss of specific features of
the unitary evolution which the system would have in the case of isolated

computation and quantum information processing technologies. A system-theoretic
definition of decoherence time in terms of the commutator matrix decay is
discussed, and an upper bound for it is provided using algebraic Lyapunov
inequalities. Employing spectrum perturbation techniques, we investigate the
asymptotic behaviour of a related Lyapunov exponent for the oscillator when the

given coupling shape matrix. The invariant quantum state of the system, driven
by vacuum fields, in the weak-coupling limit is also studied. We illustrate the
results for one- and two-mode oscillators with multichannel external fields and

a high level of accuracy by microstates, characterized as a sequence of time
intervals within which the sign invariant normalized scalp electric potential
field remains quasi-stable, concatenated by fast transitions. Filtering the EEG
has a small effect on the spatial microstate scalp maps, but a large effect on
the dynamics (e.g. duration, frequency of occurrence, and transition rates). In
addition, spectral power has been found to be strongly correlated with
microstate dynamics. And yet, the nature of the relation between spectra and
microstates remains poorly understood. Here we show that the multivariate EEG
cross-spectrum contains sufficient generative information for estimating the
microstate scalp maps and their dynamics, demonstrating an underlying
fundamental link between the microstate model and the multivariate
cross-spectrum. Empirically, based on EEG recordings from 203 participants in
eyes-closed resting state, their cross-spectral matrices were computed, from
which stochastic EEG was generated. No significant differences were found for
the microstate model (maps and dynamics) estimated from the actual EEG and from
the stochastic EEG based solely on the cross-spectra. In addition, with the aim
of quantifying the spatio-cross-spectral properties of the microstate model, we
introduce here the topographic likelihood spectrum, based on the Watson
distribution, which provides a frequency-by-frequency account of the
contribution of a normalized microstate map to the normalized EEG
cross-spectrum, independent of power. The topographic likelihood spectra are
distinct for the different microstate maps. In a comparison between eyes-closed

Thus we ask whether ViTs can facilitate feature learning in MVS? In this paper,
we propose a pre-trained ViT enhanced MVS network called MVSFormer, which can
learn more reliable feature representations benefited by informative priors
from ViT. The finetuned MVSFormer with hierarchical ViTs of efficient attention
mechanisms can achieve prominent improvement based on FPNs. Besides, the

alleviates the training cost with competitive performance strengthened by the
attention map from the self-distillation pre-training. MVSFormer can be
generalized to various input resolutions with efficient multi-scale training
strengthened by gradient accumulation. Moreover, we discuss the merits and
drawbacks of classification and regression-based MVS methods, and further
propose to unify them with a temperature-based strategy. MVSFormer achieves

signature of MBH formation in dwarf galaxies. We argue that a continuum in the
mass spectrum of MBHs in (fossil) dwarf galaxies would be a unique signature of
a heavy seed formation pathway. The continuum in this case would consist of the
usual population of stellar mass black holes, formed through stellar evolution,
plus a smaller population of heavy seed MBHs which have not yet sunk to the

the parent gas cloud resulting in a burst of heavy seed production, a
significant fraction of these seeds will survive to the present day as
off-nuclear MBHs with masses less than that of the central object. Motivated by
the recent discovery of a MBH in the relatively low central density Leo I
galaxy, we show that such a continuum in MBH seed masses should persist from
the lightest black hole masses up to the mass of the central MBH in contrast to
the light seeding scenario where no such continuum should exist. The detection
of off-centered MBHs and a central MBH would represent strong evidence of a

question is how these non-separable causal structures can be related to the
thermodynamic phenomena. Here, we approach this problem by considering the
existence of two cooperating local Maxwell's demons which try to exploit the
presence of global correlations and indefinite causal order to optimize the
extraction of work. Thus, we prove that it is possible to have a larger
probability to lower the local energy to zero if causal inequalities are
violated, and that can be extracted more average work with respect to a
definite causal order. However, for non-interacting parties, for the system
considered the work extractable cannot be larger than the definite causal order
bound.

systems since the imbalance between majority (head) classes and minority (tail)
classes severely skews the data-driven deep neural networks. Previous methods
tackle with data imbalance from the viewpoints of data distribution, feature
space, and model design, etc. In this work, instead of directly learning a
recognition model, we suggest confronting the bottleneck of head-to-tail bias
before classifier learning, from the previously omitted perspective of
balancing label space. To alleviate the head-to-tail bias, we propose a concise
paradigm by progressively adjusting label space and dividing the head classes
and tail classes, dynamically constructing balance from imbalance to facilitate
the classification. With flexible data filtering and label space mapping, we
can easily embed our approach to most classification models, especially the
decoupled training methods. Besides, we find the separability of head-tail
classes varies among different features with different inductive biases. Hence,
our proposed model also provides a feature evaluation method and paves the way
for long-tailed feature learning. Extensive experiments show that our method
can boost the performance of state-of-the-arts of different types on
widely-used benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/silicx/DLSA.

magnetic interactions via the conduction electrons of a non-magnetic spacer,
resulting in a ferro- or antiferromagnetic magnetization in magnetic
multilayers. The resulting spin-polarized charge transport effects have found
numerous applications. Recently it has been discovered that heavy non-magnetic
spacers are able to mediate an indirect magnetic coupling that is non-collinear
and chiral. This Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-enhanced RKKY (DME-RKKY) interaction
causes the emergence of a variety of interesting magnetic structures, such as
skyrmions and spin spirals. Applications using these magnetic quasi-particles
require a thorough understanding and fine-tuning of the balance between the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and other magnetic interactions, e.g., the
exchange interaction and magnetic anisotropy contributions. Here, we show by
spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy that the spin structure of
manganese oxide chains on Ir(001) can reproducibly be switched from chiral to
collinear antiferromagnetic interchain interactions by increasing the oxidation
state of MnO$_2$ while the reverse process can be induced by thermal reduction.
The underlying structural change is revealed by low-energy electron diffraction
intensity data (LEED-IV) analysis. Density functional theory calculations
suggest that the magnetic transition may be caused by a significant increase of
the Heisenberg exchange upon oxidation.

shapes based on their intended usage, function and role in a complex scenario.
Even if different attempts have been done in this direction, shape modelling
still mainly focuses on geometry. However, 3D models have a structure, given by
the arrangement of salient parts, and shape and structure are deeply related to
semantics and functionality. Changing geometry without semantic clues may
invalidate such functionalities or the meaning of objects or their parts. Here,
the problem is approached by considering semantics as the formalised knowledge
related to a category of objects; the geometry can vary provided that the
semantics is preserved. The semantics and the variable geometry of a class of
shapes is represented through the parametric template: an annotated 3D model
whose geometry can be deformed provided that some semantic constraints remain
satisfied. In this work, the design and development of a framework for the
semantics-aware modelling of shapes is presented, offering the user a single
application environment where the whole workflow of defining the parametric
template and applying semantics-aware deformations can take place. In
particular, the system provides tools for the selection and annotation of
geometry based on a formalised contextual knowledge; shape analysis methods to
derive new knowledge implicitly encoded in the geometry, and possibly enrich
the given semantics; a set of constraints that the user can apply to salient
parts and a deformation operation that takes into account the semantic
constraints and provides an optimal solution. The framework is modular so that
new tools can be continuously added.

future material optimization strategies towards more desirable optical
properties and more photocatalytically active materials. However, the wide
range of structural motifs found in synthesized PCNs complicates atomistic
simulations that rely on well defined models. Performing hybrid DFT studies, we
systematically investigate formation energy trends and optical properties of
PCNs as a function of dimensionality, going from molecular oligomers over
periodic sheet models to stacked crystals. Thermochemical calculations that
take into account vibrational enthalpy and entropy contributions predict that a
mixture of structural motifs including the melon string structure,
poly(heptazine imide), and g-C3N4 motifs is stable under typical synthetic
conditions. The degree of lateral condensation as well as stacking can reduce
the bandgap while out-of-plane corrugation of the material increases both
stability and the optical gap. The key result of this work is that already
small domains of strongly condensed PCN are calculated to give rise to
favorable optical properties. This result reconciles conflicting literature
reports indicating that the thermodynamically favorable melon motif has a too
large bandgap compared to experiments, while the g-C3N4 structure, for which
bandgap calculations are in better agreement with experiments, does not agree
with measured chemical compositions of PCNs. Finally, we postulate a new
computational model for carbon nitride materials that encompasses the most
important structural motifs and shows a bandgap of ca. 2.9 eV.

accuracy in rather harsh environmental conditions. In many use cases, device
reliability must be guaranteed under large external loads at high frequencies.
The sensitivity of the sensor to such external loads depends strongly on the
damping, or rather quality factor, of the high frequency mechanical modes of
the structure. In this paper, we investigate the influence of thermoelastic
damping on several high frequency modes by comparing finite element simulations
with measurements of the quality factor in an application-relevant temperature
range. We measure the quality factors over different temperatures in vacuum, to
extract the relevant thermoelastic material parameters of the polycrystalline
MEMS device. Our simulation results show a good agreement with the measured
quantities, therefore proving the applicability of our method for predictive
purposes in the MEMS design process. Overall, we are able to uniquely identify
the thermoelastic effects and show their significance for the damping of the
high frequency modes of an industrial MEMS gyroscope. Our approach is generic
and therefore easily applicable to any mechanical structure with many possible
applications in nano- and micromechanical systems.

self-adapting based on the risk scores and trust profiles. We compare this
design with the existing standards such as OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect and SAML

the resilience of the proposed architecture against common and relevant threat

cost for an adversary to launch and sustain any cyber attack and provides
much-needed strength to critical infrastructure. We also discuss the machine

to QSM, and Susceptibility Tensor Imaging (STI) are substantially biased by the
unaccounted-for structural anisotropy due to the mesoscopic frequency

susceptibility anisotropy as expected. Experiments in mouse brains acquired at
ultrahigh field shows the mesoscopic contribution due to WM microstructure to
be substantial. This in turn changed estimated susceptibility values up to 25%

underscores how microstructural field effects impact susceptibility estimates,

perfect localization. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption fails,
as agents are presented with imperfect perception, which leads to degraded
performance. In this work, we address the problem of autonomous grading under
uncertainties. First, we implement a simulation and a scaled real-world

decision process and train an agent capable of handling such uncertainties. We
show, through rigorous experiments, that an agent trained under perfect

uncertainties. However, an agent trained using our method will develop a more
robust policy for addressing such errors and, consequently, exhibit a better
grading performance.

conveniently leverage structure in $\mathcal T$, such as sparsity and various

builds and extends upon existing results on the generalized Nystr\""om

the most demanding workloads for high-performance computing (HPC) in the oil

plays a vital role as it could save considerable computational efforts.
State-of-the-art optimization techniques are based on running numerous
simulations, specific for that purpose, to find good parameter candidates.
However, using such an approach is highly costly in terms of time and computing
resources. This work presents TunaOil, a new methodology to enhance the search
for optimal numerical parameters of reservoir flow simulations using a
performance model. In the O&G industry, it is common to use ensembles of models
in different workflows to reduce the uncertainty associated with forecasting
O&G production. We leverage the runs of those ensembles in such workflows to
extract information from each simulation and optimize the numerical parameters
in their subsequent runs.
  To validate the methodology, we implemented it in a history matching (HM)
process that uses a Kalman filter algorithm to adjust an ensemble of reservoir
models to match the observed data from the real field. We mine past execution
logs from many simulations with different numerical configurations and build a
machine learning model based on extracted features from the data. These
features include properties of the reservoir models themselves, such as the
number of active cells, to statistics of the simulation's behavior, such as the
number of iterations of the linear solver. A sampling technique is used to
query the oracle to find the numerical parameters that can reduce the elapsed
time without significantly impacting the quality of the results. Our
experiments show that the predictions can improve the overall HM workflow
runtime on average by 31%.

the trigger event time is perfectly covered by an increasing sequence of

nature of these stopping times the trigger event time can be either accessible
or totally inaccessible. When some of these stopping times are not predictable,
the trigger event time is totally inaccessible, and very nice mathematical
computations can be derived. When the stopping times are predictable, the
trigger event time is accessible, and this case would be a meaningful choice
for Model 1 from a practical point of view since features like seasonality are
already captured by some quantities such as the stochastic intensity of the
Poisson process. We compute the main tools for pricing the zero-coupon CAT bond

attributes having a high effect on price movement, we collect all
Bitcoin-related tweets posted in a certain period and divide them into four

show that tweets posted by users with the most followers have the most

increasing research interest. Taking the cooccurrence relationship of multiple
labels as additional information helps to improve the performance of this task.
Current methods focus on using it to constrain the final feature output of a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). On the one hand, these methods do not make
full use of label correlation to form feature representation. On the other
hand, they increase the label noise sensitivity of the system, resulting in
poor robustness. In this paper, a novel method called Semantic Interleaving
Global Channel Attention (SIGNA) is proposed for MLRSIC. First, the label
co-occurrence graph is obtained according to the statistical information of the
data set. The label co-occurrence graph is used as the input of the Graph
Neural Network (GNN) to generate optimal feature representations. Then, the
semantic features and visual features are interleaved, to guide the feature
expression of the image from the original feature space to the semantic feature
space with embedded label relations. SIGNA triggers global attention of feature
maps channels in a new semantic feature space to extract more important visual
features. Multihead SIGNA based feature adaptive weighting networks are
proposed to act on any layer of CNN in a plug-and-play manner. For remote
sensing images, better classification performance can be achieved by inserting
CNN into the shallow layer. We conduct extensive experimental comparisons on
three data sets: UCM data set, AID data set, and DFC15 data set. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed SIGNA achieves superior classification
performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. It is worth mentioning

by Blondeau, Canteaut, and Charpin, which makes the corpus of S-boxes somehow
larger regarding their differential uniformity and, therefore, possibly, more
suitable candidates against the differential attack (or their variants).
Specifically, given two coprime positive integers $m$ and $k$ such that
$\gcd(2^m+1,2^k+1)=1$, we investigate the locally-APN-ness property of an
infinite family of Niho type power functions in the form $F(x)=x^{s(2^m-1)+1}$

$(2^k+1)^{-1}$ denotes the multiplicative inverse modulo $2^m+1$.
  By employing finer studies of the number of solutions of certain equations
over finite fields (with even characteristic) as well as some subtle
manipulations of solving some equations, we prove that $F(x)$ is locally APN
and determine its differential spectrum. It is worth noting that computer
experiments show that this class of locally-APN power functions covers all Niho
type locally-APN power functions for $2\leq m\leq10$. In addition, we also
determine the boomerang spectrum of $F(x)$ by using its differential spectrum,

of all the galaxies in the Universe. Ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) form a
subclass of LSBs that has attracted a lot of attention in recent years
(although its definition may vary between studies). Although UDGs are found in
large numbers in galaxy clusters, groups, and in the field, their formation and
evolution are still very much debated. Using a comprehensive set of
multiwavelength data from the NGVS (optical), VESTIGE (H$\alpha$ narrowband),
and GUViCS (UV) surveys, we studied a sample of 64 diffuse galaxies and UDGs in
the Virgo cluster to investigate their formation history. We analyzed the
photometric colors and surface-brightness profiles of these galaxies and then
compared them to models of galaxy evolution, including ram-pressure stripping
(RPS) events to infer any possible strong interactions with the hot cluster gas
in the past. While our sample consists mainly of red LSBs, which is typical in
cluster environments, we found evidence of a color variation with the
cluster-centric distance. Blue, HI-bearing, star-forming diffuse galaxies are
found at larger distances from the cluster center than the rest of the sample.
The comparison of our models with multifrequency observations suggests that
most of the galaxies of the sample might have undergone a strong RPS event in
their lifetime, on average 1.6 Gyr ago (with a large dispersion, and RPS still
ongoing for some of them). This process resulted in the transformation of
initially gas-rich diffuse blue galaxies into gas-poor and red ones that form
the dominant population now, the more extreme UDGs having undergone the process
in a more distant past on average. The RPS in dense environments could be one
of the major mechanisms for the formation of the large number of quiescent UDGs
we observe in galaxy clusters.

profile of scatterers, sequential MUSIC algorithms are suited for the detection
of sparse point-like scatterers. In this class of methods, successive
cancellation is performed through orthogonal complement projections on the
MUSIC power spectrum. In this work, a new sequential MUSIC algorithm named
recursive covariance canceled MUSIC (RCC-MUSIC), is proposed. This method
brings higher accuracy in comparison with the previous sequential methods at
the cost of a negligible increase in computational cost. Furthermore, to
improve the performance of RCC-MUSIC, it is combined with the recent method of
covariance matrix estimation called correlation subspace. Utilizing the
correlation subspace method results in a denoised covariance matrix which in
turn, increases the accuracy of subspace-based methods. Several numerical
examples are presented to compare the performance of the proposed method with
the relevant state-of-the-art methods. As a subspace method, simulation results
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in terms of estimation
accuracy and computational load.

three core questions: First, what to drop in self-attention layers? Different
from dropping attention weights in literature, we propose to move dropout
operations forward ahead of attention matrix calculation and set the Key as the
dropout unit, yielding a novel dropout-before-softmax scheme. We theoretically
verify that this scheme helps keep both regularization and probability features
of attention weights, alleviating the overfittings problem to specific patterns
and enhancing the model to globally capture vital information; Second, how to
schedule the drop ratio in consecutive layers? In contrast to exploit a
constant drop ratio for all layers, we present a new decreasing schedule that
gradually decreases the drop ratio along the stack of self-attention layers. We
experimentally validate the proposed schedule can avoid overfittings in
low-level features and missing in high-level semantics, thus improving the
robustness and stableness of model training; Third, whether need to perform
structured dropout operation as CNN? We attempt patch-based block-version of
dropout operation and find that this useful trick for CNN is not essential for
ViT. Given exploration on the above three questions, we present the novel
DropKey method that regards Key as the drop unit and exploits decreasing
schedule for drop ratio, improving ViTs in a general way. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DropKey for various ViT
architectures, e.g. T2T and VOLO, as well as for various vision tasks, e.g.,

established to cancel the RSI as much as possible. The considered
decode-and-forward (DF) hybrid relay can operate in either half-duplex or
full-duplex mode, and the mode changes adaptively depending on the RSI
strength. We investigate a robust transceiver design problem, which maximizes
the throughput rate corresponding to the worst-case RSI under a
self-interference channel uncertainty bound constraint. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that uses the IRS for RSI cancellation in
MIMO full-duplex DF relay systems. The yielded problem turns out to be a
non-convex optimization problem, where the non-convex objective is optimized
over the cone of semidefinite matrices. We propose a closed-from lower bound
for the IRS worst case RSI cancellation. Eventually, we show an important
result that, for the worst case scenario, IRS can be helpful only if the number
of IRS elements are at least as large as the size of the interference channel.
Moreover, a novel method based on majorization theory is proposed to find the
best response of the transmitters and relay against worst case RSI.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-level water-filling algorithm to obtain a

optimal antenna allocation at the relay input-frontend and output-frontend, for

that in high-mass white dwarfs, which are probably the results of mergers,
magnetic fields are extremely common and very strong, and appear immediately in
the cooling phase. These fields may have been generated by a dynamo active
during the merging. Lower mass white dwarfs, which are often the product of
single star evolution, are rarely detectably magnetic at birth, but fields
appear very slowly, and very weakly, in about a quarter of them. What we may
see is an internal field produced in an earlier evolutionary stage that
gradually relaxes to the surface from the interior. The frequency and strength
of magnetic fields continue to increase to eventually rival those of
highly-massive stars, particularly after the stars cool past the start of core
crystallisation, an effect that could be responsible for a dynamo mechanism

approaches to adjust for bias due to missing data, such as inverse probability
weighting, rely on the assumption that data are missing at random and can yield
biased results if this assumption is violated. In observational studies with
outcome data missing not at random, Heckman's sample selection model can be
used to adjust for bias due to missing data. In this paper, we review Heckman's
method and a similar approach proposed by Tchetgen Tchetgen and Wirth (2017).
We then discuss how to apply these methods to Mendelian randomization analyses
using individual-level data, with missing data for either the exposure or
outcome or both. We explore whether genetic variants associated with
participation can be used as instruments for selection. We then describe how to
obtain missingness-adjusted Wald ratio, two-stage least squares and inverse
variance weighted estimates. The two methods are evaluated and compared in
simulations, with results suggesting that they can both mitigate selection bias
but may yield parameter estimates with large standard errors in some settings.

barely touch one another and can thus sustain nonlinear solitary wave
propagation only. The linear intruder absorbs a given amount of energy
depending on the frequency content of the incident solitary wave. A numerical

of the numerical model allows for the theoretical study of the energy absorbed

exponentially with the latter, indicating that only ten of the intruders is
enough to absorb the system energy. A detailed study of the transmitted energy
from an external source into the chain reveals that, due to nonlinearity, the
array of spheres is able to convert almost any mechanical shock to a well
defined solitary or trains of solitary waves, whose frequency content is nearly
independent on the excitation amplitude. This property leads to the design of a
device, which is optimized to absorb energy over a broad frequency range.

The penalty parameter seeks to minimize spectral/dispersion errors while

behaviors. Sampling-based approaches, like rapidly exploring random trees

planning problems. Despite its exponential convergence rate, RRT can only find
suboptimal paths. On the other hand, $\textrm{RRT}^*$, a widely-used extension
to RRT, guarantees probabilistic completeness for finding optimal paths but
suffers in practice from slow convergence in complex environments. Furthermore,
real-world robotic environments are often partially observable or with poorly
described dynamics, casting the application of $\textrm{RRT}^*$ in complex
tasks suboptimal. This paper studies a novel algorithmic formulation of the
popular Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm for robot path planning.
Notably, we study Monte-Carlo Path Planning (MCPP) by analyzing and proving, on
the one part, its exponential convergence rate to the optimal path in fully
observable Markov decision processes (MDPs), and on the other part, its
probabilistic completeness for finding feasible paths in partially observable
MDPs (POMDPs) assuming limited distance observability (proof sketch). Our
algorithmic contribution allows us to employ recently proposed variants of MCTS

this issue, this paper tackles Single-view 3D Mesh Reconstruction, to study the

factorize the complicated image-to-mesh mapping into two simpler mappings,

mainly a geometric problem and less dependent on object categories. Secondly,
we devise a local feature sampling strategy in 2D and 3D feature spaces to
capture the local geometry shared across objects to enhance model
generalization. Thirdly, apart from the traditional point-to-point supervision,
we introduce a multi-view silhouette loss to supervise the surface generation
process, which provides additional regularization and further relieves the

Specifically, we study the cosmological features of a particular class of

$f(R,G)= R^n G^{1-n}$ model. In the context of a spatially flat, homogeneous
and isotropic background, we show that the currently observed acceleration of
the Universe can be addressed through geometry, hence avoiding \emph{de facto}
the shortcomings of the cosmological constant. We thus present a strategy to
numerically solve the Friedmann equations in presence of pressureless matter
and obtain the redshift behavior of the Hubble expansion rate. Then, to check
the viability of the model, we place constraints on the free parameters of the
theory by means of a Bayesian Monte Carlo method applied to late-time cosmic
observations. Our results show that the $f(R,G)$ model is capable of mimicking
the low-redshift behavior of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, though
substantial differences emerge when going toward high redshifts, leading to the
absence of a standard matter-dominated epoch. Finally, we investigate the
energy conditions and show that, under suitable choices for the values of the
cosmographic parameters, they are all violated when considering the mean value

perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, high domain-wall mobility, and good thermal

and polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) measurements to investigate the
interfaces of an epitaxially-grown MgO/Mn$_4$N/Pt trilayer deposited at 450

essentially zero net magnetization at room temperature. Despite the
high-temperature deposition at 450 $^{\circ}$C, the thickness of mixing regions
is comparable to those observed in magnetic films deposited at room

wave--mean-flow interactions and other multiscale fluid phenomena. The
numerical computation of Lagrangian means, e.g. from simulation data, is
however challenging. Typical implementations require tracking a large number of
particles to construct Lagrangian time series which are then averaged using a
low-pass filter. This has drawbacks that include large memory demands, particle
clustering and complications of parallelisation. We develop a novel approach in
which the Lagrangian means of various fields (including particle positions) are
computed by solving partial differential equations (PDEs) that are integrated
over successive averaging time intervals. We propose two strategies,
distinguished by their spatial independent variables. The first, which
generalises the algorithm of Kafiabad (2022, J. Fluid Mech. 940, A2), uses
end-of-interval particle positions; the second directly uses the Lagrangian
mean positions. The PDEs can be discretised in a variety of ways, e.g. using
the same discretisation as that employed for the governing dynamical equations,
and solved on-the-fly to minimise the memory footprint. We illustrate the new
approach with a pseudospectral implementation for the rotating shallow-water
model. Two applications to flows that combine vortical turbulence and Poincare

to the NTN also benefits coexisting GUEs, preventing uplink outages of around
12% that GUEs would otherwise incur. Despite the limited bandwidth available
below 6 GHz, NTN-offloaded UAVs meet command and control rate requirements even
across an area the size of Barcelona with as many as one active UAV per cell.
Smaller UAV populations yield proportionally higher rates, potentially enabling
aerial broadband applications.

astrophysical topics, ranging from stellar atmospheres over stellar and
galactic evolution to the cosmic distance scale. Aims. A hybrid non-LTE
approach - line-blanketed model atmospheres computed under the assumption of
local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in combination with line formation
calculations that account for deviations from LTE - is tested for quantitative
analyses of B-type supergiants with masses $M<30 M_{\odot}$, characterising a
sample of 14 Galactic objects. Methods. Hydrostatic plane-parallel atmospheric
structures and synthetic spectra computed with Kurucz's Atlas12 code together
with the non-LTE line-formation codes Detail/Surface are compared to results
from full non-LTE calculations with Tlusty, and the effects of turbulent
pressure on the models are investigated. High-resolution spectra are analysed
for atmospheric parameters, using Stark-broadened hydrogen lines and multiple
metal ionisation equilibria, and for elemental abundances. Fundamental stellar
parameters are derived by considering stellar evolution tracks and Gaia EDR3
parallaxes. Interstellar reddening towards the target stars is determined by
matching model spectral energy distributions to observed ones. Results. Our
hybrid non-LTE approach turns out to be equivalent to hydrostatic full non-LTE
modelling for the deeper photospheric layers of the B-type supergiants
considered. Turbulent pressure can become relevant for microturbulent
velocities larger than 10 km s$^{-1}$. High precision and accuracy is achieved
for all derived parameters by bringing multiple indicators to agreement
simultaneously. Abundances for chemical species (He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si,
S, Ar, Fe) are derived with uncertainties of 0.05 to 0.10 dex. The derived
ratios N/C vs. N/O tightly follow the predictions from Geneva stellar evolution
models.

detecting relict landslides in areas covered with rainforest, mainly related to

suspicious events in computing systems, allowing machine operators to detect
and subsequently investigate security incidents. While auditing has proven
invaluable to the security of traditional computers, existing audit frameworks
are rarely designed with consideration for Real-Time Systems (RTS). The
transparency provided by system auditing would be of tremendous benefit in a
variety of security-critical RTS domains, (e.g., autonomous vehicles); however,
if audit mechanisms are not carefully integrated into RTS, auditing can be
rendered ineffectual and violate the real-world temporal requirements of the
RTS.
  In this paper, we demonstrate how to adapt commodity audit frameworks to RTS.
Using Linux Audit as a case study, we first demonstrate that the volume of
audit events generated by commodity frameworks is unsustainable within the
temporal and resource constraints of real-time (RT) applications. To address
this, we present Ellipsis, a set of kernel-based reduction techniques that
leverage the periodic repetitive nature of RT applications to aggressively
reduce the costs of system-level auditing. Ellipsis generates succinct
descriptions of RT applications' expected activity while retaining a detailed
record of unexpected activities, enabling analysis of suspicious activity while
meeting temporal constraints. Our evaluation of Ellipsis, using ArduPilot (an
open-source autopilot application suite) demonstrates up to 93% reduction in

  Prospects",,,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  On embedded processors that are increasingly equipped with multiple CPU
cores, static hardware partitioning is an established means of consolidating
and isolating workloads onto single chips. This architectural pattern is
suitable for mixed-criticality workloads that need to satisfy both, real-time
and safety requirements, given suitable hardware properties. In this work, we
focus on exploiting contemporary virtualisation mechanisms to achieve freedom
from interference respectively isolation between workloads. Possibilities to
achieve temporal and spatial isolation-while maintaining real-time
capabilities-include statically partitioning resources, avoiding the sharing of
devices, and ascertaining zero interventions of superordinate control
structures. This eliminates overhead due to hardware partitioning, but implies
certain hardware capabilities that are not yet fully implemented in
contemporary standard systems. To address such hardware limitations, the
customisable and configurable RISC-V instruction set architecture offers the
possibility of swift, unrestricted modifications. We present findings on the
current RISC-V specification and its implementations that necessitate
interventions of superordinate control structures. We identify numerous issues
adverse to implementing our goal of achieving zero interventions respectively
zero overhead: On the design level, and especially with regards to handling
interrupts. Based on micro-benchmark measurements, we discuss the implications
of our findings, and argue how they can provide a basis for future extensions
and improvements of the RISC-V architecture.

stationary models has led to the common practice of exploiting prior

these models can perform poorly, especially in high dimensions. We propose
novel informative covariance functions for optimization, leveraging
nonstationarity to encode preferences for certain regions of the search space

novel view synthesis. However, previous works on NeRF mainly focus on
object-centric scenarios. In this work, we propose 360Roam, a novel scene-level
NeRF system that can synthesize images of large-scale indoor scenes in real
time and support VR roaming. Our system first builds an omnidirectional neural
radiance field 360NeRF from multiple input $360^\circ$ images. Using 360NeRF,
we then progressively estimate a 3D probabilistic occupancy map which
represents the scene geometry in the form of spacial density. Skipping empty
spaces and upsampling occupied voxels essentially allows us to accelerate
volume rendering by using 360NeRF in a geometry-aware fashion. Furthermore, we
use an adaptive divide-and-conquer strategy to slim and fine-tune the radiance
fields for further improvement. The floorplan of the scene extracted from the
occupancy map can provide guidance for ray sampling and facilitate a realistic
roaming experience. To show the efficacy of our system, we collect a
$360^\circ$ image dataset in a large variety of scenes and conduct extensive
experiments. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons among baselines
illustrated our predominant performance in novel view synthesis for complex
indoor scenes.

agricultural computer vision. Such models are typically fine-tuned to
agricultural tasks using model weights that were originally fit to more
general, non-agricultural datasets. This lack of agriculture-specific
fine-tuning potentially increases training time and resource use, and decreases
model performance, leading an overall decrease in data efficiency. To overcome
this limitation, we collect a wide range of existing public datasets for three
distinct tasks, standardize them, and construct standard training and
evaluation pipelines, providing us with a set of benchmarks and pretrained
models. We then conduct a number of experiments using methods which are
commonly used in deep learning tasks, but unexplored in their domain-specific
applications for agriculture. Our experiments guide us in developing a number
of approaches to improve data efficiency when training agricultural deep
learning models, without large-scale modifications to existing pipelines. Our
results demonstrate that even slight training modifications, such as using
agricultural pretrained model weights, or adopting specific spatial
augmentations into data processing pipelines, can significantly boost model
performance and result in shorter convergence time, saving training resources.
Furthermore, we find that even models trained on low-quality annotations can
produce comparable levels of performance to their high-quality equivalents,
suggesting that datasets with poor annotations can still be used for training,
expanding the pool of currently available datasets. Our methods are broadly
applicable throughout agricultural deep learning, and present high potential

disputes about the role of causation in fundamental physics. We argue that the
process matrix programme has correctly identified a notion of 'causal order'
which plays an important role in fundamental physics, but this notion is weaker
than the common-sense conception of causation because it does not involve
asymmetry. We argue that causal order plays an important role in grounding more
familiar causal phenomena. Then we apply these conclusions to the causal
modelling programme within quantum foundations, arguing that since
no-signalling quantum correlations cannot exhibit causal order, they should not
be analysed using classical causal models. This resolves an open question about
how to interpret fine-tuning in classical causal models of no-signalling
correlations. Finally we observe that a quantum generalization of causal
modelling can play a similar functional role to standard causal reasoning, but
we emphasize that this functional characterisation does not entail that quantum
causal models offer novel explanations of quantum processes.

has attracted significant attention in physical-layer authentication due to its
extraordinary classification performance. Conventional DL-RFF techniques are
trained by adopting maximum likelihood estimation~(MLE). Although their
discriminability has recently been extended to unknown devices in open-set
scenarios, they still tend to overfit the channel statistics embedded in the
training dataset. This restricts their practical applications as it is
challenging to collect sufficient training data capturing the characteristics
of all possible wireless channel environments. To address this challenge, we
propose a DL framework of disentangled representation~(DR) learning that first
learns to factor the signals into a device-relevant component and a
device-irrelevant component via adversarial learning. Then, it shuffles these
two parts within a dataset for implicit data augmentation, which imposes a
strong regularization on RFF extractor learning to avoid the possible
overfitting of device-irrelevant channel statistics, without collecting
additional data from unknown channels. Experiments validate that the proposed
approach, referred to as DR-based RFF, outperforms conventional methods in
terms of generalizability to unknown devices even under unknown complicated
propagation environments, e.g., dispersive multipath fading channels, even
though all the training data are collected in a simple environment with
dominated direct line-of-sight~(LoS) propagation paths.

associated with SN 2017iuk, a broad-line type Ic supernova (SN). It is
consistent with being formed in the core-collapse of a widely separated binary,
which we have called the binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) of type III. The
core-collapse of the CO star forms a newborn NS ($\nu$NS) and the SN explosion.
Fallback accretion transfers mass and angular momentum to the $\nu$NS, here
assumed to be born non-rotating. The accretion energy injected into the
expanding stellar layers powers the prompt emission. The multiwavelength
power-law afterglow is explained by the synchrotron radiation of electrons in
the SN ejecta, powered by energy injected by the spinning $\nu$NS. We calculate
the amount of mass and angular momentum gained by the $\nu$NS, as well as the
$\nu$NS rotational evolution. The $\nu$NS spins up to a period of $47$ ms, then
releases its rotational energy powering the synchrotron emission of the
afterglow. The paucity of the $\nu$NS spin explains the low-luminosity
characteristic and that the optical emission of the SN from the nickel
radioactive decay outshines the optical emission from the synchrotron
radiation. From the $\nu$NS evolution, we infer that the SN explosion had to
occur at most $7.36$ h before the GRB trigger. Therefore, for the first time,
the analysis of the GRB data leads to the time of occurrence of the CO
core-collapse leading to the SN explosion and the electromagnetic emission of
the GRB event.

we study the problem of uniqueness of wiring diagrams. We use as a modeling
framework polynomial dynamical systems and utilize the correspondence between
simplicial complexes and square-free monomial ideals from Stanley-Reisner
theory to develop theory and construct an algorithm for identifying input data
sets $V\subset \mathbb F_p^n$ that are guaranteed to correspond to a unique
minimal wiring diagram regardless of the experimental output. We apply the
results on a tumor-suppression network mediated by epidermal derived growth
factor receptor and demonstrate how careful experimental design decisions can
lead to a unique minimal wiring diagram identification. One of the insights of
the theoretical work is the connection between the uniqueness of a wiring
diagram for a given $V\subset \mathbb F_p^n$ and the uniqueness of the reduced
Gr\""obner basis of the polynomial ideal $I(V)\subset \mathbb F_p[x_1,\ldots,
x_n]$. We discuss existing results and introduce a new necessary condition on
the points in $V$ for uniqueness of the reduced Gr\""obner basis of $I(V)$.
These results also point to the importance of the relative proximity of the
experimental input points on the number of minimal wiring diagrams, which we
then study computationally. We find that there is a concrete heuristic way to
generate data that tends to result in fewer minimal wiring diagrams.

reveals a deviation from phonon-anharmonicity in the ordered state, thereby
implying a connection to spin-phonon coupling known to be indicative of onset

attributed to the anisotropic spin-texture of FePS$_3$. At low temperature

develop our MOVE method under both white-box and black-box settings to provide

unresponsive workers who cause delays. One solution studied in the literature
is to wait at each iteration for the responses of the fastest $k<n$ workers
before updating the model, where $k$ is a fixed parameter. The choice of the
value of $k$ presents a trade-off between the runtime (i.e., convergence rate)

varying $k$ that optimizes this trade-off based on an upper bound on the error
as a function of the wall-clock time that we derive. Then, we propose and
implement an algorithm for adaptive distributed SGD that is based on a

emerging research area that leverages the discriminative power of iris
biometrics to aid human examiners in their efforts to identify deceased
persons. As a machine learning-based technique in a predominantly
human-controlled task, forensic recognition serves as ""back-up"" to human
expertise in the task of post-mortem identification. As such, the machine
learning model must be (a) interpretable, and (b) post-mortem-specific, to
account for changes in decaying eye tissue. In this work, we propose a method
that satisfies both requirements, and that approaches the creation of a
post-mortem-specific feature extractor in a novel way employing human
perception. We first train a deep learning-based feature detector on
post-mortem iris images, using annotations of image regions highlighted by
humans as salient for their decision making. In effect, the method learns
interpretable features directly from humans, rather than purely data-driven
features. Second, regional iris codes (again, with human-driven filtering
kernels) are used to pair detected iris patches, which are translated into
pairwise, patch-based comparison scores. In this way, our method presents human
examiners with human-understandable visual cues in order to justify the
identification decision and corresponding confidence score. When tested on a
dataset of post-mortem iris images collected from 259 deceased subjects, the
proposed method places among the three best iris matchers, demonstrating better
results than the commercial (non-human-interpretable) VeriEye approach. We
propose a unique post-mortem iris recognition method trained with human

different languages; and evocative prompting, which involves designing nonce
words whose broad morphological features are similar enough to that of existing
words to trigger robust visual associations. The two methods can also be
combined to generate images associated with more specific visual concepts. The
implications of these techniques for the circumvention of existing approaches
to content moderation, and particularly the generation of offensive or harmful

for real-time monitoring different vehicles on the urban scale. Real-time
vehicle detection with the use of uncertainty estimation in deep meta-learning
for the portable platforms (e.g., UAV) potentially improves video understanding
in real-world applications with a small training dataset, while many vehicle
monitoring approaches appear to understand single-time detection with a big
training dataset. The purpose of real-time vehicle detection from oblique UAV
images is to locate the vehicle on the time series UAV images by using semantic
segmentation. Real-time vehicle detection is more difficult due to the variety
of depth and scale vehicles in oblique view UAV images. Motivated by these
facts, in this manuscript, we consider the problem of real-time vehicle
detection for oblique UAV images based on a small training dataset and deep
meta-learning. The proposed architecture, called SA-Net.v2, is a developed
method based on the SA-CNN for real-time vehicle detection by reformulating the
squeeze-and-attention mechanism. The SA-Net.v2 is composed of two components,
including the squeeze-and-attention function that extracts the high-level
feature based on a small training dataset, and the gated CNN. For the real-time
vehicle detection scenario, we test our model on the UAVid dataset. UAVid is a
time series oblique UAV images dataset consisting of 30 video sequences. We
examine the proposed method's applicability for stand real-time vehicle
detection in urban environments using time series UAV images. The experiments
show that the SA-Net.v2 achieves promising performance in time series oblique
UAV images.

successful recommender systems. Although powerful, it is very difficult for a
GNN-based recommender system to attach tangible explanations of why a specific
item ends up in the list of suggestions for a given user. Indeed, explaining
GNN-based recommendations is unique, and existing GNN explanation methods are
inappropriate for two reasons. First, traditional GNN explanation methods are
designed for node, edge, or graph classification tasks rather than ranking, as
in recommender systems. Second, standard machine learning explanations are
usually intended to support skilled decision-makers. Instead, recommendations
are designed for any end-user, and thus their explanations should be provided
in user-understandable ways. In this work, we propose GREASE, a novel method
for explaining the suggestions provided by any black-box GNN-based recommender
system. Specifically, GREASE first trains a surrogate model on a target
user-item pair and its $l$-hop neighborhood. Then, it generates both factual
and counterfactual explanations by finding optimal adjacency matrix
perturbations to capture the sufficient and necessary conditions for an item to
be recommended, respectively. Experimental results conducted on real-world

inconsistent, in the sense that an optimal contract may not remain optimal if
the principal reconsiders the problem at a later time. Such time inconsistency
issue becomes highly relevant when one or both parties do not commit to the
contract. In this paper we consider a model where the current agent can quit
before the expiration date, and then the principal will hire a new agent from
the market, possibly with a different type. Both parties are aware of the
non-commitment of the agent when considering the contract in the beginning. We
shall show that the new dynamic problem is time consistent in certain sense and
we characterize the principal's optimal utility through an infinite dimensional
system of HJB equations, parametrized with the agent's type. However, the
dynamic value function of the principal could be discontinuous on the boundary,
and thus it is characterized as the minimum solution of the HJB system.
  Two interesting observations are worth mentioning. First, we assume there are
a family of agents with different types in the market (as often in reality). It
is possible that the principal could hire a cheaper agent when the current one
quits, and ends up with a larger optimal utility. So, the principal may have
the incentive to design a contract to encourage the agent to quit before the
expiration date. Next, we assume the agent (and the principal) will bear some
cost when he quits. As a consequence, the principal will see only finitely many
quittings within the finite contract period.

Gaussian distribution to which the trading volume belongs. The student model
can thus learn from the teacher at a more informative distributional level, by
matching its predicted distributions to that of the teacher. Two correlational
distillation objectives are further introduced to encourage the student to
produce consistent pair-wise relationships with the teacher model. We evaluate
the framework on a real-world stock volume dataset with two different time
window settings. Experiments demonstrate that our framework is superior to
strong baseline models, compressing the model size by $5\times$ while

reveals that our framework is more effective than vanilla distillation methods

illumination has a periodic structure as the illumination in the
spatial-frequency domain, light from the stripe illumination can reach deep
regions in biological tissue since it can be regarded as an array of point
illuminations. For a pair of a source and a detector, the shape of light paths
which connect the source and detector is called the banana shape. First, we
investigate the depth of the banana. In the case of the zero boundary
condition, we found that the depth of the center of the banana is $d_{\rm
SD}/(2\sqrt{2})$, where $d_{\rm SD}$ is the distance between the source and
detector on the boundary. In general, the depth is about $0.3d_{\rm SD}$ when
$d_{\rm SD}\approx2\,{\rm cm}$ and the ratio of refractive indices on the
boundary is about $1.37$. Next, we perform diffuse optical tomography for the
stripe illumination against forward data taken by Monte Carlo simulation. We
consider an impulse illumination of the shape of a stripe. This time-resolved
measurement is more informative than conventional continuous-wave measurements

multiclass common spatial patterns. During the last decade, however, more
sophisticated machine learning architectures, such as convolutional neural
networks, recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks and gated
recurrent unit networks, have been extensively used to enhance discriminability
in multiclass BCI tasks. Additionally, preprocessing and denoising of EEG
signals has always been key in the successful decoding of brain activity, and
the determination of an optimal and standardized EEG preprocessing activity is
an active area of research. In this paper, we present a deep neural network
architecture specifically engineered to a) provide state-of-the-art performance
in multiclass motor imagery classification and b) remain robust to
preprocessing to enable real-time processing of raw data as it streams from EEG

Instead of considering the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, we use Timoshenko's
approach instead, which is known to be more realistic at higher frequencies.
Our goal is to minimize the reflection coefficient under a constraint imposed
on the normalized wave number variation. We use the calculus of variations in
order to derive the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation analytically and then
use numerical methods to solve this equation in order to find the optimal
height profile for different frequencies. We then compare these profiles to the
corresponding ones previously found using the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and
see that in the lower range of the dimensionless frequency $\Omega$ (defined
using the largest height of the plate), the optimal profiles almost coincide,
as expected. For higher such frequencies, even for values where Euler-Bernoulli
theory should still be marginally valid, the profiles predicted using
Euler-Bernoulli differ substantially from the correct ones predicted by
Timoshenko theory. One explanation for this phenomenon is that unlike in the
constant height case, in our setting the wave numbers also depend on the ratio
between the smallest and the largest heights.
