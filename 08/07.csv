opportunity to compare the differing properties of coronal mass ejections

24 (SC 24). We report on the width evolution of limb CMEs in SC 23 and 24 in
order to test the suggestion by Gopalswamy et al. (2015a) that CME flux ropes
attain pressure balance at larger heliocentric distances in SC 24. We measure
CME width as a function of heliocentric distance for a significantly large
number of limb CMEs (~1000) and determine the distances where the CMEs reach
constant width in each cycle. We introduced a new parameter: the transition
height (hc) of a CME defined as the critical heliocentric distance beyond which
the CME width stabilizes to a quasi-constant value. Cycle and phase-to-phase
comparisons are based on this new parameter. We find that the average value of
hc in SC 24 is 62% higher than in SC 23. SC 24 CMEs attain their peak width at
larger distances from the Sun as compared to SC 23 CMEs. The enhanced
transition height in SC 24 is new observational ratification of the anomalous
expansion. The anomalous expansion of SC 24 CMEs which is caused by the weak
state of the heliosphere, accounts for the larger heliocentric distance where
the pressure balance between CME flux rope and the ambient medium is attained.

emphasized the need for refined models of the Galactic dust foreground. Here,
we aim at building a realistic statistical model of the multi-frequency dust
emission from a single example. We introduce a generic methodology relying on
microcanonical gradient descent models conditioned by an extended family of
wavelet phase harmonic (WPH) statistics. To tackle the multi-channel aspect of
the data, we define cross-WPH statistics, quantifying non-Gaussian correlations
between maps. Our data-driven methodology could apply to various contexts, and
we have updated the software PyWPH, on which this work relies, accordingly.
Applying this to dust emission maps built from a magnetohydrodynamics
simulation, we construct and assess two generative models of: 1) a $(I, E, B)$
multi-observable input, 2) a $\{I_\nu\}_\nu$ multi-frequency input. The samples
exhibit consistent features compared to the original maps. A statistical
analysis of 1) shows that the power spectra, distributions of pixels, and
Minkowski functionals are captured to a good extent. We analyze 2) by fitting
the spectral energy distribution (SED) of both the synthetic and original maps
with a modified blackbody (MBB) law. The maps are equally well fitted, and a
comparison of the MBB parameters shows that our model succeeds in capturing the
spatial variations of the SED from the data. Besides the perspectives of this
work for dust emission modeling, the introduction of cross-WPH statistics opens
a new avenue to characterize non-Gaussian interactions across different maps,
which we believe will be fruitful for astrophysics.

  disease development and propagation","16 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder nowadays.
Amyloid-beta (A$\beta$) and tau proteins are among the main contributor to the
development or propagation of AD. In AD, A$\beta$ proteins clump together to
form plaques and disrupt cell functions. On the other hand, the abnormal
chemical change in the brain helps to build sticky tau tangles that block the
neuron's transport system. Astrocytes generally maintain a healthy balance in
the brain by clearing the A$\beta$ plaques (toxic A$\beta$). But,
over-activated astrocytes release chemokines and cytokines in the presence of
A$\beta$ and also react to pro-inflammatory cytokines further increasing the
production of A$\beta$. In this paper, we construct a mathematical model that
can capture astrocytes' dual behaviour. Furthermore, we reveal that the disease
propagation does not depend only on the current time instance; rather, it
depends on the disease's earlier status, called the ""memory effect"". We
consider a fractional order network mathematical model to capture the influence
of such memory effect on AD propagation. We have integrated brain connectome
data in the network model and studied the memory effect and the dual role of
astrocytes together. Depending on toxic loads in the brain, we have also
analyzed the neuronal damage in the brain. Based on the pathology, primary,
secondary, and mixed tauopathies parameters have been used in the model. Due to
the mixed tauopathy, different brain nodes or regions in the brain connectome
accumulate different toxic concentrations of toxic A$\beta$ and toxic tau
proteins. Finally, we explain how the memory effect can slow down the
propagation of such toxic proteins in the brain and hence decreases the rate of
neuronal damage.

exhibit an unstable unsteady behaviour, known as puffing, which involves a
strong coupling between the temperature and velocity fields. Despite their
practical relevance to fire research, their experimental study can be limited
due to the complexity of measuring relevant quantities in parallel. In this
work, we analyse the use of a recent physics-informed machine learning
approach, called Hidden Fluid Mechanics (HFM), to reconstruct unmeasured
quantities in a puffing pool fire from measured quantities. The HFM framework
relies on a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for this task. A PINN is a
neural network that uses both the available data, here the measured quantities,
and the physical equations governing the system, here the reacting
Navier-Stokes equations, to infer the full fluid dynamic state. This framework
is used to infer the velocity field in a puffing pool fire from measurements of
density, pressure and temperature. In this work, the dataset used for this test
was generated from numerical simulations. It is shown that the PINN is able to
reconstruct the velocity field accurately and to infer most features of the
velocity field. In addition, it is shown that the reconstruction accuracy is
robust with respect to noisy data, and a reduction in the number of measured
quantities is explored and discussed. This study opens up the possibility of
using PINNs for the reconstruction of unmeasured quantities from measured ones,
providing the potential groundwork for their use in experiments for fire

VinDr-CXR was trained on 51,485 CXR scans with radiologist-provided bounding

radiologists in classifying 6 common thoracic diseases on a retrospective
validation set of 3,000 CXR scans, with a mean area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.967 (95% confidence interval [CI]:
0.958-0.975). The VinDr-CXR was also externally validated in independent

of 1.0 false-positive lesion identified per scan. A prospective study was also
conducted to measure the clinical impact of the VinDr-CXR in assisting six

various morphologies arise from tuning the hydrophobic distribution of the

a steady Taylor-Green mixing flow, and measure the collective dynamics of JP

with very less sophisticated instruments and medication, Pneumonia detection
still remains a major concern in developing countries. Computer-aided based
diagnosis (CAD) systems can be used in such countries due to their lower
operating costs than professional medical experts. In this paper, we propose a
CAD system for Pneumonia detection from Chest X-rays, using the concepts of
deep learning and a meta-heuristic algorithm. We first extract deep features
from the pre-trained ResNet50, fine-tuned on a target Pneumonia dataset. Then,
we propose a feature selection technique based on particle swarm optimization
(PSO), which is modified using a memory-based adaptation parameter, and
enriched by incorporating an altruistic behavior into the agents. We name our
feature selection method as adaptive and altruistic PSO (AAPSO). The proposed
method successfully eliminates non-informative features obtained from the
ResNet50 model, thereby improving the Pneumonia detection ability of the
overall framework. Extensive experimentation and thorough analysis on a
publicly available Pneumonia dataset establish the superiority of the proposed
method over several other frameworks used for Pneumonia detection. Apart from
Pneumonia detection, AAPSO is further evaluated on some standard UCI datasets,
gene expression datasets for cancer prediction and a COVID-19 prediction
dataset. The overall results are satisfactory, thereby confirming the
usefulness of AAPSO in dealing with varied real-life problems. The supporting

the speaker but transferring the behavior signals from another source. We
conduct a study by comparing synthetic imagery that: 1) originates from a
different person speaking a different utterance, 2) originates from the same

that is detectable from a person's movements that is separate from their visual
appearance, and that this behavioral signature could be used to distinguish a

Mach numbers can be achieved via preconditioning the lattice Boltzmann (LB)
schemes that alleviate the associated numerical stiffness, which have so far
been constructed on square lattices. We present a new central moment LB method
on rectangular lattice grids for efficient computations of inhomogeneous and
anisotropic flows by solving the preconditioned Navier-Stokes (PNS) equations.
Moment equilibria corrections are derived via a Chapman-Enskog analysis for
eliminating the truncation errors due to grid-anisotropy arising from the use
of the rectangular lattice and the non-Galilean invariant cubic velocity errors
resulting from an aliasing effect on the standard D2Q9 lattice for consistently
recovering the PNS equations. Such corrections depend on the diagonal
components of the velocity gradients, which are locally obtained from the
second order non-equilibrium moments and parameterized by an associated grid
aspect ratio $r$ and a preconditioning parameter $\gamma$, and the speed of
sound in the collision model is naturally adapted to $r$ via a physically
consistent strategy. We develop our approach by using a robust non-orthogonal
moment basis and the central moment equilibria are based on a matching
principle, leading to simpler expressions for the corrections for using the
rectangular grids and for representing the viscosities as functions of the
relaxation parameters, $r$ and $\gamma$, and its implementation is modular
allowing a ready extension of the existing LB schemes based on the square
lattice. Numerical simulations of inhomogeneous and anisotropic shear-driven
bounded flows using the preconditioned rectangular central moment LB method
demonstrate the accuracy and significant reductions in the numbers of steps to
reach the steady states for various sets of characteristic parameters.

InfoGAN is a popular disentanglement framework that learns unsupervised

of mutual information is achieved by introducing an auxiliary network and
training with a latent regression loss. In this short exploratory paper, we
study the use of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to

study what we term Potterian economics, the economic ideas, insights, and
structure, found in Harry Potter books, to assess how the books might affect
economic literacy. A conservative estimate suggests that more than 7.3 percent
of the world population has read the Harry Potter books, and millions more have
seen their movie adaptations. These extraordinary figures underscore the
importance of the messages the books convey. We explore the Potterian economic
model and compare it to professional economic models to assess the consistency
of the Potterian economic principles with the existing economic models. We find
that some of the principles of Potterian economics are consistent with
economists models. Many other principles, however, are distorted and contain
numerous inaccuracies, contradicting professional economists views and
insights. We conclude that Potterian economics can teach us about the formation
and dissemination of folk economics, the intuitive notions of naive individuals
who see market transactions as a zero-sum game, who care about distribution but
fail to understand incentives and efficiency, and who think of prices as
allocating wealth but not resources or their efficient use.

can reliably classify an example during inference. One of the most effective
ways to build more reliable deep learning solutions is to improve their
performance in the so-called out-of-distribution detection task, which
essentially consists of ""know that you do not know"" or ""know the unknown"". In
other words, out-of-distribution detection capable systems may reject
performing a nonsense classification when submitted to instances of classes on
which the neural network was not trained. This thesis tackles the defiant
out-of-distribution detection task by proposing novel loss functions and
detection scores. Uncertainty estimation is also a crucial auxiliary task in
building more robust deep learning systems. Therefore, we also deal with this
robustness-related task, which evaluates how realistic the probabilities
presented by the deep neural network are. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, in addition to a substantial set of experiments, which includes
state-of-the-art results, we use arguments based on the principle of maximum
entropy to establish the theoretical foundation of the proposed approaches.
Unlike most current methods, our losses and scores are seamless and principled
solutions that produce accurate predictions in addition to fast and efficient
inference. Moreover, our approaches can be incorporated into current and future
projects simply by replacing the loss used to train the deep neural network and
computing a rapid score for detection.

The authors of PoL forego cryptographic approaches and trade rigorous security
guarantees for scalability to deep learning. They empirically argued the
benefit of this approach by showing how spoofing--computing a proof for a
stolen model--is as expensive as obtaining the proof honestly by training the
model. However, recent work has provided a counter-example and thus has
invalidated this observation.
  In this work we demonstrate, first, that while it is true that current PoL
verification is not robust to adversaries, recent work has largely
underestimated this lack of robustness. This is because existing spoofing
strategies are either unreproducible or target weakened instantiations of
PoL--meaning they are easily thwarted by changing hyperparameters of the
verification. Instead, we introduce the first spoofing strategies that can be
reproduced across different configurations of the PoL verification and can be
done for a fraction of the cost of previous spoofing strategies. This is
possible because we identify key vulnerabilities of PoL and systematically
analyze the underlying assumptions needed for robust verification of a proof.
On the theoretical side, we show how realizing these assumptions reduces to
open problems in learning theory.We conclude that one cannot develop a provably
robust PoL verification mechanism without further understanding of optimization

adding significant computational complexity in any given solution. To this end,

Recent progress in machine learning gave birth to a series of advanced

neural networks (GNNs) with vectorized representations for trajectory
prediction has been demonstrated by many researchers. Nonetheless, these
algorithms either pay little attention to models' generalizability across
various scenarios or simply assume training and test data follow similar
statistics. In fact, when test scenarios are unseen or Out-of-Distribution
(OOD), the resulting train-test domain shift usually leads to significant
degradation in prediction performance, which will impact downstream modules and
eventually lead to severe accidents. Therefore, it is of great importance to
thoroughly investigate the prediction models in terms of their
generalizability, which can not only help identify their weaknesses but also
provide insights on how to improve these models. This paper proposes a
generalizability analysis framework using feature attribution methods to help
interpret black-box models. For the case study, we provide an in-depth
generalizability analysis of one of the state-of-the-art graph-based trajectory
predictors that utilize vectorized representation. Results show significant
performance degradation due to domain shift, and feature attribution provides
insights to identify potential causes of these problems. Finally, we conclude
the common prediction challenges and how weighting biases induced by the

polarization to date. Here, we report that the observed properties of GRB
polarization exhibit a four-segment timing evolution at the cosmological
distance: (I) an initial hump early on (within the first few seconds); (II) a
later on power-law decay (from $\sim$10$^{1}$ to $\sim$10$^{4}$ s), which takes
the form of $\pi_{\rm obs} \propto t^{-0.50 \pm 0.02}$; (III) afterwards a
late-time rebrightening hump (from $\sim$10$^{4}$ to $\sim$10$^{5}$ s); and

These findings may present a challenge to the mainstream of polarization models

larger generators, longer blades, and taller towers. Presently, up to 16 MW
wind turbines are being offered by wind turbines manufacturers which is nearly
a 60 percent increase in the design capacity over the last five years.
Manufacturing of these turbines involves assembling of gigantic sized
components. Due to the frequent design changes and the variety of tasks
involved, conventional automation is not possible making it a labor-intensive
activity. However the handling and assembling of large components are
challenging the human capabilities. The article proposes the use of mobile
robotic assistants for partial automation of wind turbines manufacturing. The
robotic assistant can result into reducing production costs, and better work
conditions. The article presents development of a robot assistant for human
operators to effectively perform assembly of wind turbines. The case is from a
leading wind turbines manufacturer. The developed system is also applicable to
other cases of large component manufacturing involving intensive manual effort.

realized in multiplayer structures consisting of alternating magnetic and
undoped topological insulator layers. However, in previous proposals, the Chern
number can be only tuned by varying the doping concentration or the width of
the magnetic topological insulator layers. This drawback largely restrict the
applications of dissipationless chiral edge currents in electronics since the
number of conducting channels remains fixed. In this work, we propose a way of
varying the Chern number at will in these multilayered structures by means of
an external electric field applied along the stacking direction. In the
presence of an electric field in the stacking direction, the inverted bands of
the unbiased structure coalesce and hybridize, generating new inverted bands
and collapsing the previously inverted ones. In this way, the number of Chern
states can be tuned externally in the sample, without the need of modifying the
number and width of the layers or the doping level. We showed that this effect
can be uncovered by the variation of the transverse conductance as a function
of the electric field at constant injection energy at the Fermi level.

aggregation, the cardinality of its output is always the same as the
cardinality of input. That is, the semantics of this operator imply computing
values for extra attributes for each row, depending on its context, either
expressed by a sliding window or a previously evaluated row. Window functions
are a very powerful tool, which is also popular among data analysts and
supported by the majority of industrial DBMSes. It allows to gracefully express
quite complex use-cases, such as running sums and averages, local maximum and
minimum, and different types of ranking. Since they can be expressed without
self-joins and correlated subqueries, their evaluation can be performed much
more efficiently.
  In this paper we discuss an implementation of window functions inside a
disk-based column-store with late materialization. Late materialization is a
technique that aims to keep tuple reconstruction back from individual columns
as long as possible. Initially popular in the late 00's, it is rarely
considered nowadays. However, in case of window functions it allows to
substantially lower memory footprint. Another contribution of this paper is the
application of a segment tree to computing RANGE-based window functions.

massless neutrinos to acquire an effective mass around the meV scale. It is
fascinating to contemplate the channel induced by the non-linear dark photon
leading to the pairing of the non-relativistic neutrinos, hence generating a
cosmological superfluid state. As a consequence, the appearance of a light

(i) characterize the internal stress induced by the microscale dislocation
pileup at an atomically structured interface; (ii) decompose this stress into
two parts, one of which is from the dislocations behind the pileup tip
according to the Eshelby model and the other is from the dislocations at the
pileup tip according to a super-dislocation model; and (iii) assess how such
internal stresses contribute to the atomic-scale phase transformations (PTs),
reverse PTs, and twinning. The main novelty of this work is to unify the
atomistic description of the interface and the coarse-grained (CG) description
of the lagging dislocations away from the interface within one single
framework. Our major findings are: (a) the interface dynamically responds to a
pileup by forming steps/ledges, the height of which is proportional to the
number of dislocations arriving at the interface; (b) when the pre-sheared
sample is compressed, a direct square-to-hexagonal PT occurs ahead of the
pileup tip and eventually grows into a wedge shape; (c) upon a further increase
of the loading, part of the newly formed hexagonal phase transforms back to the
square phase. The square product phase resulting from this reverse PT forms a
twin with respect to the initial square phase. All phase boundaries (PBs) and
twin boundaries (TBs) are stationary and correspond to zero thermodynamic
Eshelby driving forces; and (d) the stress intensity induced by a pileup
consisting of 16 dislocations reduces the stress required for initiating a PT
by a factor of 5.5, comparing with that in the sample containing no
dislocations. This work is the first characterization of the behavior of
PTs/twinning resulting from the reaction between a microscale dislocation slip
and an atomically structured interface.

in 2007 and 2009. These lattices are necessarily finite and planar, and they
have been studied in more then four dozen papers since 2007. They are best
understood with the help of their $\mathcal C_1$-diagrams, introduced by the
author in 2017. For a diagram $F$ of a finite lattice $L$ and a congruence
$\alpha$ of $L$, we define the ``quotient diagram'' $F/\alpha$ by taking the
maximal elements of the $\alpha$-blocks and preserving their geometric
positions. While $F/\alpha$ is not even a Hasse diagram in general, we prove
that whenever $L$ is an SR lattice and $F$ is a $\mathcal C_1$-diagram of $L$,
then $F/\alpha$ is a $\mathcal C_1$-diagram of $L/\alpha$, which is an SR
lattice or a chain. The class of lattices isomorphic to the congruence lattices
of SPS lattices is closed under taking filters. We prove that this class is
closed under two more constructions, which are inverses of taking filters in
some sense; one of the two respective proofs relies on an inverse of the
quotient diagram construction.

the most common ways for visualizing and analyzing deep networks in the

cannot represent authentic information in images due to the unproven proposals
about the weights of activation maps which lack solid theoretical foundation
and fail to consider the relations between each pixel. In this paper, we
develop a novel post-hoc visual explanation method called Shap-CAM based on
class activation mapping. Unlike previous gradient-based approaches, Shap-CAM
gets rid of the dependence on gradients by obtaining the importance of each
pixel through Shapley value. We demonstrate that Shap-CAM achieves better
visual performance and fairness for interpreting the decision making process.
Our approach outperforms previous methods on both recognition and localization

changing data distributions, including evolving patient population and new
diagnosis assays, continual learning models that alleviate model forgetting
need to be introduced in DP based analysis. However, to our best knowledge,
there is no systematic study of such models for DP-specific applications. Here,
we propose CL scenarios in DP settings, where histopathology image data from
different sources/distributions arrive sequentially, the knowledge of which is
integrated into a single model without training all the data from scratch. We
then established an augmented dataset for colorectal cancer H&E classification
to simulate shifts of image appearance and evaluated CL model performance in
the proposed CL scenarios. We leveraged a breast tumor H&E dataset along with
the colorectal cancer to evaluate CL from different tumor types. In addition,
we evaluated CL methods in an online few-shot setting under the constraints of

query-based attacks. Transfer methods do not require any feedback from the
victim model, but provide lower success rates compared to query-based methods.
Query attacks often require a large number of queries for success. To achieve
the best of both approaches, recent efforts have tried to combine them, but
still require hundreds of queries to achieve high success rates (especially for
targeted attacks). In this paper, we propose a novel method for Blackbox
Attacks via Surrogate Ensemble Search (BASES) that can generate highly
successful blackbox attacks using an extremely small number of queries. We
first define a perturbation machine that generates a perturbed image by
minimizing a weighted loss function over a fixed set of surrogate models. To
generate an attack for a given victim model, we search over the weights in the
loss function using queries generated by the perturbation machine. Since the
dimension of the search space is small (same as the number of surrogate
models), the search requires a small number of queries. We demonstrate that our
proposed method achieves better success rate with at least 30x fewer queries
compared to state-of-the-art methods on different image classifiers trained
with ImageNet. In particular, our method requires as few as 3 queries per image
(on average) to achieve more than a 90% success rate for targeted attacks and
1-2 queries per image for over a 99% success rate for untargeted attacks. Our
method is also effective on Google Cloud Vision API and achieved a 91%

the perturbations generated by our proposed method are highly transferable and
can be adopted for hard-label blackbox attacks. We also show effectiveness of

spectrum, often exhibiting heavy-tailed flux distributions, commonly modeled as
lognormal. However, Tavecchio et al. (2020) and Adams et al. (2022) found that
the high-energy gamma-ray flux distributions of several of the brightest
flaring Fermi-LAT flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) are well modeled by an
even heavier-tailed distribution, which we show is the inverse gamma
distribution. We propose an autoregressive inverse gamma variability model in
which an inverse gamma flux distribution arises as a consequence of a
shot-noise process. In this model, discrete bursts are individually unresolved
and averaged over within time bins, as in the analysis of Fermi-LAT data.
Stochastic variability on timescales longer than the time bin duration is
modeled using first-order autoregressive structure. The flux distribution
becomes approximately lognormal in the limiting case of many weak bursts. The
fractional variability is predicted to decrease as the time bin duration
increases. Using simulated light curves, we show that the proposed model is
consistent with the typical gamma-ray variability properties of FSRQs and BL
Lac objects. The model parameters can be physically interpreted as the average
burst rate, the burst fluence, and the timescale of long-term stochastic
fluctuations.

  Music Recommendation",,,,,"cs.MM cs.SD eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Micro-video background music recommendation is a complicated task where the
matching degree between videos and uploader-selected background music is a
major issue. However, the selection of the user-generated content (UGC) is
biased caused by knowledge limitations and historical preferences among music
of each uploader. In this paper, we propose a Debiased Cross-Modal (DebCM)
matching model to alleviate the influence of such selection bias. Specifically,
we design a teacher-student network to utilize the matching of segments of
music videos, which is professional-generated content (PGC) with specialized
music-matching techniques, to better alleviate the bias caused by insufficient
knowledge of users. The PGC data is captured by a teacher network to guide the
matching of uploader-selected UGC data of the student network by KL-based
knowledge transfer. In addition, uploaders' personal preferences of music
genres are identified as confounders that spuriously correlate music embeddings
and background music selections, resulting in the learned recommender system to
over-recommend music from the majority groups. To resolve such confounders in
the UGC data of the student network, backdoor adjustment is utilized to
deconfound the spurious correlation between music embeddings and prediction
scores. We further utilize Monte Carlo (MC) estimator with batch-level average
as the approximations to avoid integrating the entire confounder space
calculated by the adjustment. Extensive experiments on the TT-150k-genre
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method towards the
selection bias. The code is publicly available on:

decentralized training data. FL allows clients to update model parameters
locally for several epochs, then share them to a global model for aggregation.
This training paradigm with multi-local step updating before aggregation
exposes unique vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is
a popular and effective method to improve the robustness of networks against
adversaries. In this work, we formulate a general form of federated adversarial
learning (FAL) that is adapted from adversarial learning in the centralized
setting. On the client side of FL training, FAL has an inner loop to generate
adversarial samples for adversarial training and an outer loop to update local
model parameters. On the server side, FAL aggregates local model updates and
broadcast the aggregated model. We design a global robust training loss and
formulate FAL training as a min-max optimization problem. Unlike the
convergence analysis in classical centralized training that relies on the
gradient direction, it is significantly harder to analyze the convergence in
FAL for three reasons: 1) the complexity of min-max optimization, 2) model not
updating in the gradient direction due to the multi-local updates on the
client-side before aggregation and 3) inter-client heterogeneity. We address
these challenges by using appropriate gradient approximation and coupling
techniques and present the convergence analysis in the over-parameterized
regime. Our main result theoretically shows that the minimum loss under our
algorithm can converge to $\epsilon$ small with chosen learning rate and
communication rounds. It is noteworthy that our analysis is feasible for

two most representative computer vision tasks: object detection and image
classification. We then create new CNN architectures by applying SPD-Conv to
YOLOv5 and ResNet, and empirically show that our approach significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models, especially on tougher tasks

items at each time step is less explored. Due to the dynamics of users'
interests and model updates during training, considering randomly sampled items
from a user's non-interacted item set as negatives can be uninformative. As a
result, the model will inaccurately learn user preferences toward items.
Identifying informative negatives is challenging because informative negative
items are tied with both dynamically changed interests and model parameters
(and sampling process should also be efficient). To this end, we propose to
Generate Negative Samples (items) for SR (GenNi). A negative item is sampled at
each time step based on the current SR model's learned user preferences toward
items. An efficient implementation is proposed to further accelerate the
generation process, making it scalable to large-scale recommendation tasks.
Extensive experiments on four public datasets verify the importance of
providing high-quality negative samples for SR and demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of GenNi.

integrated into mobile devices. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on
sensor data has become an active research topic in the field of machine
learning and ubiquitous computing. However, due to the inconsistent frequency
of human activities, the amount of data for each activity in the human activity
dataset is imbalanced. Considering the limited sensor resources and the high
cost of manually labeled sensor data, human activity recognition is facing the
challenge of highly imbalanced activity datasets. In this paper, we propose
Balancing Sensor Data Generative Adversarial Networks (BSDGAN) to generate
sensor data for minority human activities. The proposed BSDGAN consists of a
generator model and a discriminator model. Considering the extreme imbalance of
human activity dataset, an autoencoder is employed to initialize the training
process of BSDGAN, ensure the data features of each activity can be learned.
The generated activity data is combined with the original dataset to balance
the amount of activity data across human activity classes. We deployed multiple
human activity recognition models on two publicly available imbalanced human
activity datasets, WISDM and UNIMIB. Experimental results show that the
proposed BSDGAN can effectively capture the data features of real human
activity sensor data, and generate realistic synthetic sensor data. Meanwhile,
the balanced activity dataset can effectively help the activity recognition

complete observation of videos and can not localize video frames containing
normal FMs. Therefore we propose a novel approach named WO-GMA to perform FMs
localization in the weakly supervised online setting. Infant body keypoints are
first extracted as the inputs to WO-GMA. Then WO-GMA performs local
spatio-temporal extraction followed by two network branches to generate pseudo

action modeling branch learns to detect FMs in an online fashion. Experimental
results on a dataset with 757 videos of different infants show that WO-GMA can

(CVL). The task is to localize a query camera by leveraging information from
its past observations, i.e., a continuous sequence of images observed at
previous time stamps, and matching them to a large overhead-view satellite
image. The critical challenge of this task is to learn a powerful global
feature descriptor for the sequential ground-view images while considering its
domain alignment with reference satellite images. For this purpose, we
introduce CVLNet, which first projects the sequential ground-view images into
an overhead view by exploring the ground-and-overhead geometric correspondences
and then leverages the photo consistency among the projected images to form a
global representation. In this way, the cross-view domain differences are
bridged. Since the reference satellite images are usually pre-cropped and
regularly sampled, there is always a misalignment between the query camera
location and its matching satellite image center. Motivated by this, we propose
estimating the query camera's relative displacement to a satellite image before
similarity matching. In this displacement estimation process, we also consider
the uncertainty of the camera location. For example, a camera is unlikely to be
on top of trees. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we collect
satellite images from Google Map for the KITTI dataset and construct a new
cross-view video-based localization benchmark dataset, KITTI-CVL. Extensive

  Stimuli from Brain Activity",,,,,"cs.MM cs.CV cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Recent studies demonstrate the use of a two-stage supervised framework to
generate images that depict human perception to visual stimuli from EEG,
referring to EEG-visual reconstruction. They are, however, unable to reproduce
the exact visual stimulus, since it is the human-specified annotation of
images, not their data, that determines what the synthesized images are.
Moreover, synthesized images often suffer from noisy EEG encodings and unstable
training of generative models, making them hard to recognize. Instead, we
present a single-stage EEG-visual retrieval paradigm where data of two
modalities are correlated, as opposed to their annotations, allowing us to
recover the exact visual stimulus for an EEG clip. We maximize the mutual
information between the EEG encoding and associated visual stimulus through
optimization of a contrastive self-supervised objective, leading to two
additional benefits. One, it enables EEG encodings to handle visual classes
beyond seen ones during training, since learning is not directed at class
annotations. In addition, the model is no longer required to generate every
detail of the visual stimulus, but rather focuses on cross-modal alignment and
retrieves images at the instance level, ensuring distinguishable model output.
Empirical studies are conducted on the largest single-subject EEG dataset that
measures brain activities evoked by image stimuli. We demonstrate the proposed
approach completes an instance-level EEG-visual retrieval task which existing
methods cannot. We also examine the implications of a range of EEG and visual
encoder structures. Furthermore, for a mostly studied semantic-level EEG-visual
classification task, despite not using class annotations, the proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art supervised EEG-visual reconstruction approaches,
particularly on the capability of open class recognition.

North/South (N/S) asymmetry and the phase mixing signatures, such as a phase
spiral (snail) structure in the vertical phase space ($z-V_{z}$). We show that
the N/S asymmetry in a tracer population of dwarfs may be quantitatively
modeled with a simple phase snail model superimposed on a smooth equilibrium
background. As the phase snail intersects with the $z$ axis, the number density
is enhanced, and the velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{z}$) is decreased relative
to the other side of the Galactic plane. Fitting only to the observed
asymmetric N/S $\sigma_{z}$ profiles, we obtain reasonable parameters for the
phase space snail and the potential utilized in modeling the background,
despite the complex dependence of the model on the potential parameters and the
significant selection effects of the data. Both the snail shape and the N/S
number density difference given by our best-fit model are consistent with
previous observations. The equilibrium background implies a local dark matter
density of $0.0151^{+0.0050}_{-0.0051}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-3}$. The
vertical bulk motion of our model is similar to the observation, but with a
$\sim$1.2 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$ shift. Our work demonstrates the strong correlation
between the phase space snail and the N/S asymmetry. Future observational
constraints will facilitate more comprehensive snail models to unravel the
Milky Way potential and the perturbation history encoded in the snail feature.

time-integrated polarizations of 37 GRBs with polarization observation. We used
their observed spectral parameters to do this. In the model, the emission
mechanism is synchrotron radiation, and the magnetic field configuration in the
emission region was assumed to be large-scale ordered. Therefore, the predicted
polarization degrees (PDs) are upper limits. Results. For most GRBs detected by
the Gamma-ray Burst Polarimeter (GAP), POLAR, and AstroSat, the predicted PD
can match the corresponding observed PD. Hence the synchrotron-emission model
in a large-scale ordered magnetic field can interpret both the moderately low
PDs ($\sim10\%$) detected by POLAR and relatively high PDs ($\sim45\%$)
observed by GAP and AstroSat well. Therefore, the magnetic fields in these GRB
prompt phases or at least during the peak times are dominated by the ordered
component. However, the predicted PDs of GRB 110721A observed by GAP and GRB
180427A observed by AstroSat are both lower than the observed values. Because
the synchrotron emission in an ordered magnetic field predicts the upper-limit
of the PD for the synchrotron-emission models, PD observations of the two
bursts challenge the synchrotron-emission model. Then we predict the PDs of the
High-energy Polarimetry Detector (HPD) and Low-energy Polarimetry Detector
(LPD) on board the upcoming POLAR-2. In the synchrotron-emission models, the
concentrated PD values of the GRBs detected by HPD will be higher than the LPD,
which might be different from the predictions of the dissipative photosphere
model. Therefore, more accurate multiband polarization observations are highly
desired to test models of the GRB prompt phase.

THz channel entails several unique challenges such as severe path loss and
beam-split. Prior works usually employ ultra-massive arrays and additional
hardware components comprised of time-delayers to compensate for these loses.
In order to provide a cost-effective solution, this paper introduces a
sparse-Bayesian-learning (SBL) technique for joint channel and beam-split

perturbation inspired from array signal processing. Next, a low-complexity
approach is developed by exploiting the line-of-sight-dominant feature of THz

federated-learning, we implement a model-free technique to the proposed

considerations of THz channel, and introduce the range-dependent near-field
beam-split. The theoretical performance bounds, i.e., Cram\'er-Rao lower

  Using a Batch Selection of Probability of Improvement",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bayesian global optimization (BGO) is an efficient surrogate-assisted
technique for problems involving expensive evaluations. A parallel technique
can be used to parallelly evaluate the true-expensive objective functions in
one iteration to boost the execution time. An effective and straightforward
approach is to design an acquisition function that can evaluate the performance
of a bath of multiple solutions, instead of a single point/solution, in one
iteration. This paper proposes five alternatives of \emph{Probability of
Improvement} (PoI) with multiple points in a batch (q-PoI) for multi-objective
Bayesian global optimization (MOBGO), taking the covariance among multiple
points into account. Both exact computational formulas and the Monte Carlo
approximation algorithms for all proposed q-PoIs are provided. Based on the
distribution of the multiple points relevant to the Pareto-front, the
position-dependent behavior of the five q-PoIs is investigated. Moreover, the
five q-PoIs are compared with the other nine state-of-the-art and recently
proposed batch MOBGO algorithms on twenty bio-objective benchmarks. The
empirical experiments on different variety of benchmarks are conducted to
demonstrate the effectiveness of two greedy q-PoIs ($\kpoi_{\mbox{best}}$ and
$\kpoi_{\mbox{all}}$) on low-dimensional problems and the effectiveness of two
explorative q-PoIs ($\kpoi_{\mbox{one}}$ and $\kpoi_{\mbox{worst}}$) on
high-dimensional problems with difficult-to-approximate Pareto front
boundaries.

Quantum field measurements using the Quantum Temporal Probabilities (QTP)
method; 2) Closed-Time-Path (CTP) formalism for causal time evolutions. QTP
incorporates the detector into the quantum description, while emphasising that
the records of measurement are macroscopic, and they can be expressed in terms
of classical spacetime coordinates. We first present a new, elementary
derivation of the QTP formulas for the probabilities of n measurement events.
We then demonstrate the relation of QTP with the Closed-Time-Path formalism, by
writing an explicit formula that relates the associated generating functionals.
We exploit the path integral representation of the CTP formalism, in order to
express the measured probabilities in terms of path integrals. After this, we
provide some simple applications of the QTP formalism. In particular, we show
how Unruh-DeWitt detector models and Glauber's photodetection theory appear as
limiting cases . Finally, with quantum correlation being the pivotal notion in
relativistic quantum information and measurements, we highlight the role played
by the CTP two-particle irreducible effective action which enables one to tap
into the resources of non-equilibrium quantum field theory for our stated
purpose.

cooperative computation to achieve systemlevel targets, distributed
optimization is incrementally favored by both engineering and computer science.
The well-known alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has turned
out to be one of the most popular tools for distributed optimization due to
many advantages, such as modular structure, superior convergence, easy
implementation and high flexibility. In the past decade, ADMM has experienced
widespread developments. The developments manifest in both handling more
general problems and enabling more effective implementation. Specifically, the
method has been generalized to broad classes of problems (i.e.,multi-block,
coupled objective, nonconvex, etc.). Besides, it has been extensively
reinforced for more effective implementation, such as improved convergence
rate, easier subproblems, higher computation efficiency, flexible
communication, compatible with inaccurate information, robust to communication
delays, etc. These developments lead to a plentiful of ADMM variants to be
celebrated by broad areas ranging from smart grids, smart buildings, wireless
communications, machine learning and beyond. However, there lacks a survey to
document those developments and discern the results. To achieve such a goal,
this paper provides a comprehensive survey on ADMM variants. Particularly, we
discern the five major classes of problems that have been mostly concerned and
discuss the related ADMM variants in terms of main ideas, main assumptions,
convergence behaviors and main features. In addition, we figure out several
important future research directions to be addressed. This survey is expected
to work as a tutorial for both developing distributed optimization in broad
areas and identifying existing theoretical research gaps.

investigating if the past of one time series affects the future of the other.
It helps in answering the question whether one time series is helpful in
forecasting. Standard traditional approaches to Granger causality detection
commonly assume linear dynamics, but such simplification does not hold in many
real-world applications, e.g., neuroscience or genomics that are inherently
non-linear. In such cases, imposing linear models such as Vector Autoregressive
(VAR) models can lead to inconsistent estimation of true Granger Causal
interactions. Machine Learning (ML) can learn the hidden patterns in the
datasets specifically Deep Learning (DL) has shown tremendous promise in
learning the non-linear dynamics of complex systems. Recent work of Tank et al
propose to overcome the issue of linear simplification in VAR models by using
neural networks combined with sparsity-inducing penalties on the learn-able
weights. In this work, we build upon ideas introduced by Tank et al. We propose
several new classes of models that can handle underlying non-linearity.
Firstly, we present the Learned Kernal VAR(LeKVAR) model-an extension of VAR
models that also learns kernel parametrized by a neural net. Secondly, we show
one can directly decouple lags and individual time series importance via
decoupled penalties. This decoupling provides better scaling and allows us to
embed lag selection into RNNs. Lastly, we propose a new training algorithm that
supports mini-batching, and it is compatible with commonly used adaptive
optimizers such as Adam.he proposed techniques are evaluated on several
simulated datasets inspired by real-world applications.We also apply these
methods to the Electro-Encephalogram (EEG) data for an epilepsy patient to

film of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ superconductor with a hole in the film suggests that
charge-$4e$ and charge-$6e$ Cooper pairs may have condensed in this compound.
While exciting, such interpretation calls for a precise determination of the
effective area for the passage of Cooper pairs from one end of the lead to the
other. Unlike the traditional Little-Parks effect where the rim around the hole
is thin, the effective hole area is not obviously defined for the ""thick-rim
geometry"" adopted in [arxiv:2201.10352]. Here, we note that the experiment was
conducted in a regime where the superconctivity is strongly fluctuating, which
motivates an analysis based on the spacetime formulation of the time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau theory. We argue that under appropriate conditions, the optimal
semi-classical path is not the geometrically shortest one, but the one that
moves along the edge of the hole and takes advantage of the reduced
fluctuations at the boundary of the hole. The condition for the cross-over from
the geometrically shortest path to the path that sticks to the wall is
clarified. In such a scenario, the geometric area of the hole indeed emerges as
the effective area for the flux, providing a theoretical justification to the
interpretation given in [arxiv:2201.10352]. The conclusion of our analysis may
have implication for similar experiments in other superconductors where the
geometry of the device is not obviously that of the Little-Parks experiment
employing the thin wall, but of the thick-rim type such as used in
[arxiv:2201.10352].

this too ideal. Certain tensor-based methods for handing incomplete multi-view

norm is defined to implement graph tensor data recover. The recovered graphs
are then regularized to a consistent low-dimensional representation of the
samples. In addition, adaptive weights are equipped to each view to adjust the
importance of different views. Compared with the existing methods, our method

presents an Analytical Parking Planning Model (APPM) for the SAV environment to
provide broader insights into parking planning decisions. Two specific planning
scenarios are considered for the APPM: (i) Single-zone APPM (S-APPM), which
considers the target area as a single homogeneous zone, and (ii) Two-zone APPM
(T-APPM), which considers the target area as two different zones, such as city
center and suburban area. S-APPM offers a closed-form solution to find the
optimal density of parking stations and parking spaces and the optimal number
of SAV fleets, which is beneficial for understanding the explicit relationship
between planning decisions and the given environments, including demand density
and cost factors. In addition, to incorporate different macroscopic
characteristics across two zones, T-APPM accounts for inter- and intra-zonal
passenger trips and the relocation of vehicles. We conduct a case study to
demonstrate the proposed method with the actual data collected in Seoul

factors are performed to provide decision-makers with further insights. Also,

specialize in a small number of technologies. In this paper, we investigated
who the leaders are at the regional and assignee levels, how they attained
their leadership positions, and whether they adopted diversification or
specialization strategies, using a dataset of 176,193 patent records on
graphene between 1986 and 2017 downloaded from Derwent Innovation. By applying
a co-clustering method to the IPC subclasses in the patents and using a z-score
method to extract keywords from their titles and abstracts, we identified seven
graphene technology areas emerging in the sequence synthesis - composites -
sensors - devices - catalyst - batteries - water treatment. We then examined
the top regions in their investment preferences and their changes in rankings
over time and found that they invested in all seven technology areas. In
contrast, at the assignee level, some were diversified while others were
specialized. We found that large entities diversified their portfolios across
multiple technology areas, while small entities specialized around their core
competencies. In addition, we found that universities had higher entropy values
than corporations on average, leading us to the hypothesis that corporations
file, buy, or sell patents to enable product development. In contrast,
universities focus only on licensing their patents. We validated this
hypothesis through an aggregate analysis of reassignment and licensing and a
more detailed analysis of three case studies - SAMSUNG, RICE UNIVERSITY, and

the presence of this quantum structure in human cognition. Thus, we show that
in an archetype of human perception consisting of the reconciliation of a
bottom up stimulus with a top down cognitive expectation pattern, there arises
the typical warping of categorical perception, where groups of stimuli clump
together to form quanta, which move away from each other and lead to a
discretization of a dimension. The individual concepts, which are these quanta,
can be modeled by a quantum prototype theory with the square of the absolute
value of a corresponding Schr\""odinger wave function as the fuzzy prototype
structure, and the superposition of two such wave functions accounts for the
interference pattern that occurs when these concepts are combined. Using a
simple quantum measurement model, we analyze this archetype of human
perception, provide an overview of the experimental evidence base for
categorical perception with the phenomenon of warping leading to quantization,
and illustrate our analyses with two examples worked out in detail.

pair of 'master integrable systems' and investigate their Poisson reductions.
In the simplest cotangent bundle case, the reduction is defined by taking
quotient by the cotangent lift of the conjugation action of $G$ on itself, and
this naturally generalizes to the other two doubles. In each case, we derive
explicit formulas for the reduced Poisson structure and equations of motion and
find that they are associated with well known classical dynamical $r$-matrices.
Our principal result is that we provide a unified treatment of a large family
of reduced systems, which contains new models as well as examples of spin
Sutherland and Ruijsenaars--Schneider models that were studied previously. We
argue that on generic symplectic leaves of the Poisson quotients the reduced
systems are integrable in the degenerate sense, although further work is
required to prove this rigorously.

of human serum albumin (HSA) microcapsules using the electrodeformation
technique which shows that HSA capsules are strain-softening in nature. The
viscoelasto-electrohydrodynamic model was utilized to understand the creep
mechanism in the HSA capsules. The effect of different reaction parameters such
as protein concentration and pH on the morphology of the capsule membrane was
investigated, and an attempt has been made to correlate microstructure with the
mechanical properties. The pH has a remarkable effect on the morphology of HSA
microcapsules which is also reflected in their mechanical characteristics. The
capsule synthesized with carbonate buffer shows very distinct morphology with
pores on the membrane surface, making the membrane less elastic with
significant nonrecoverable creep. The capsules synthesized with different
protein concentrations at the same pH condition show different morphology and
thus different rheological properties. Capsules with a low concentration of HSA
show smooth membrane structure with higher Young's modulus than the capsules
synthesized at a very high concentration which show a rough folded wavy
structure with low membrane elastic modulus. The effect of frequency on the
interfacial rheological properties of human serum albumin capsules was studied
using a frequency sweep test using the electrodeformation technique. The
rheological properties were computed incorporating the
viscoelasto-electrohydrodynamic model for the oscillatory response of capsules.
The results show that the elastic response dominates in the high-frequency
regime. Thus the electrodeformation technique allows studying the effect of
very high-frequency 1 Hz to 1 kHz, which is otherwise not possible with the
conventional rheometers.

Kennicutt-Schmidt law, a power-law relationship between the surface density of

formation rate ($\Sigma_{SFR}$) [$\textrm{M}_{\odot}\; \textrm{kpc}^{-2} \;

are typically associated with little to no star formation and therefore no
Kennicutt-Schmidt law; recent observations, however, have noted the presence of
massive gaseous cold disks in ETGs, raising the question as to why the
conversion of gas into stars is so inefficient. With our latest simulations,
performed with our high-resolution hydrodynamic numerical code MACER, we
reevaluate the traditional classification of ETGs as quiescent, dead galaxies.
We predict the inevitable formation of stellar disks following cooling episodes
of the ISM of the host galaxy in the presence of galactic rotation via a simple
but robust star formation model combining local Toomre instabilities and local
gas cooling timescales. We find that resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt star formation
laws for our simulated ETGs, in both surface density and volumetric forms,
reproduce the observed threshold, slope, and normalization observed in disk
galaxies. At the same time, through analysis of global Kennicutt-Schmidt laws,
we suggest that increased star formation and high gaseous outflows offers a
partial remedy to the observed star formation inefficiency problem.
Observational checks of our star formation predictions are thus essential for
confirming the form of local star formation laws and reassessing star formation
inefficiency in ETGs.

integrable systems, the MT model only admits the rogue waves of bright-type,
and the higher-order rogue waves represent the superposition of fundamental

in the amplitude of the sole huge peak of order $N$ being $2N+1$ times the

  with Directional Antennas",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Omni-directional pathloss, which refers to the pathloss when omni-directional
antennas are used at the link ends, are essential for system design and
evaluation. In the millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) and beyond bands, high gain
directional antennas are widely used for channel measurements due to the
significant signal attenuation. Conventional methods for omni-directional
pathloss estimation are based on directional scanning sounding (DSS) system,
i.e., a single directional antenna placed at the center of a rotator capturing
signals from different rotation angles. The omni-directional pathloss is
obtained by either summing up all the powers above the noise level or just
summing up the powers of detected propagation paths. However, both methods are
problematic with relatively wide main beams and high side-lobes provided by the
directional antennas. In this letter, directional antenna based virtual antenna
array (VAA) system is implemented for omni-directional pathloss estimation. The
VAA scheme uses the same measurement system as the DSS, yet it offers high
angular resolution (i.e. narrow main beam) and low side-lobes, which is
essential for achieving accurate multipath detection in the power angular delay
profiles (PADPs) and thereby obtaining accurate omni-directional pathloss. A
measurement campaign was designed and conducted in an indoor corridor at 28-30
GHz to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

video coding community since they have matched or even exceeded the
rate-distortion (RD) performance of traditional video codecs. However, many
current learning-based methods are dedicated to utilizing short-range temporal
information, thus limiting their performance. In this paper, we focus on
exploiting the unique characteristics of video content and further exploring
temporal information to enhance compression performance. Specifically, for
long-range temporal information exploitation, we propose temporal prior that
can update continuously within the group of pictures (GOP) during inference. In
that case temporal prior contains valuable temporal information of all decoded
images within the current GOP. As for short-range temporal information, we
propose a progressive guided motion compensation to achieve robust and
effective compensation. In detail, we design a hierarchical structure to
achieve multi-scale compensation. More importantly, we use optical flow
guidance to generate pixel offsets between feature maps at each scale, and the
compensation results at each scale will be used to guide the following scale's
compensation. Sufficient experimental results demonstrate that our method can
obtain better RD performance than state-of-the-art video compression

  Severity Prediction",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dysphonia is one of the early symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Most
existing methods use feature selection methods to find the optimal subset of
voice features for all PD patients. Few have considered the heterogeneity
between patients, which implies the need to provide specific prediction models
for different patients. However, building the specific model faces the
challenge of small sample size, which makes it lack generalization ability.
Instance transfer is an effective way to solve this problem. Therefore, this
paper proposes a patient-specific game-based transfer (PSGT) method for PD
severity prediction. First, a selection mechanism is used to select PD patients
with similar disease trends to the target patient from the source domain, which
greatly reduces the risk of negative transfer. Then, the contribution of the
transferred subjects and their instances to the disease estimation of the
target subject is fairly evaluated by the Shapley value, which improves the
interpretability of the method. Next, the proportion of valid instances in the
transferred subjects is determined, and the instances with higher contribution
are transferred to further reduce the difference between the transferred
instance subset and the target subject. Finally, the selected subset of
instances is added to the training set of the target subject, and the extended
data is fed into the random forest to improve the performance of the method.
Parkinson's telemonitoring dataset is used to evaluate the feasibility and
effectiveness. Experiment results show that the PSGT has better performance in
both prediction error and stability over compared methods.

representing images discretely with 2D arrays of pixels, a recent study, namely
local implicit image function (LIIF), denotes images as a continuous function
where pixel values are expansion by using the corresponding coordinates as
inputs. Due to its continuous nature, LIIF can be adopted for arbitrary-scale
image super-resolution tasks, resulting in a single effective and efficient
model for various up-scaling factors. However, LIIF often suffers from
structural distortions and ringing artifacts around edges, mostly because all
pixels share the same model, thus ignoring the local properties of the image.
In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive local image function (A-LIIF) to
alleviate this problem. Specifically, our A-LIIF consists of two main
components: an encoder and a expansion network. The former captures cross-scale
image features, while the latter models the continuous up-scaling function by a
weighted combination of multiple local implicit image functions. Accordingly,
our A-LIIF can reconstruct the high-frequency textures and structures more

third and fourth near equilibrium of $7.5\,{\rm fm}$. Moreover, we have founded
a closer agreement of high order approximation and given potential which has
width range of $0.43\,{\rm fm^{-1}}$. Although equality between scalar and
vector potentials give output in the solvable form, the improved approximation
provides the spatial-independent rest mass as a ""pure oscillator"" without
external field. In the absence of scalar distribution, minimal coupling might
also leads to an oscillation at equilibrium distances, so we have considered an
adding of extra-energy giving shifted Morse potential in the depth range 80 to
100 MeV. As a result of the shift, it has been concluded that the potential
depth of the charged particle affects the relativistic energy levels where we
have found about 200 MeV being for particles and nearly -10 MeV being for
anti-particles. Besides negative energy states, the typical probability picture
showing spin-zero charge distribution has been followed by the wavefunctions as
($n=0$ $\ell=0$) and ($n=1$, $\ell=1$) corresponding to relativistic energies.

nonlinear filtering function. The main advantage of the contribution is that
weaker equivalents can be computed for any nonlinear filter, in the sense that
such equivalents could be used to cryptanalyze apparently secure generators.
Consequently, to evaluate the cryptographic resistance of a sequence generator,
the weakest equivalent cipher should be determined and not only a particular
instance.

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2205.03884",,,,"math.OC cs.CR cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  By enabling multiple agents to cooperatively solve a global optimization
problem in the absence of a central coordinator, decentralized stochastic
optimization is gaining increasing attention in areas as diverse as machine
learning, control, and sensor networks. Since the associated data usually
contain sensitive information, such as user locations and personal identities,
privacy protection has emerged as a crucial need in the implementation of
decentralized stochastic optimization. In this paper, we propose a
decentralized stochastic optimization algorithm that is able to guarantee
provable convergence accuracy even in the presence of aggressive quantization
errors that are proportional to the amplitude of quantization inputs. The
result applies to both convex and non-convex objective functions, and enables
us to exploit aggressive quantization schemes to obfuscate shared information,
and hence enables privacy protection without losing provable optimization
accuracy. In fact, by using a {stochastic} ternary quantization scheme, which
quantizes any value to three numerical levels, we achieve quantization-based
rigorous differential privacy in decentralized stochastic optimization, which
has not been reported before. In combination with the presented quantization
scheme, the proposed algorithm ensures, for the first time, rigorous
differential privacy in decentralized stochastic optimization without losing
provable convergence accuracy. Simulation results for a distributed estimation
problem as well as numerical experiments for decentralized learning on a
benchmark machine learning dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

volumes, which co-evolve with the mutual influence of several queries and
locations, serve as an important social sensor. It is an important task to
accurately forecast the future activity by discovering latent interactions from
such data, i.e., the ecosystems between each query and the flow of influences
between each area. However, this is a difficult problem in terms of data
quantity and complex patterns covering the dynamics. To tackle the problem, we
propose FluxCube, which is an effective mining method that forecasts large
collections of co-evolving online user activity and provides good
interpretability. Our model is the expansion of a combination of two
mathematical models: a reaction-diffusion system provides a framework for
modeling the flow of influences between local area groups and an ecological
system models the latent interactions between each query. Also, by leveraging
the concept of physics-informed neural networks, FluxCube achieves high
interpretability obtained from the parameters and high forecasting performance,
together. Extensive experiments on real datasets showed that FluxCube
outperforms comparable models in terms of the forecasting accuracy, and each
component in FluxCube contributes to the enhanced performance. We then show
some case studies that FluxCube can extract useful latent interactions between
queries and area groups.

studying the transitions to complete and generalized synchronizations in the
coupled oscillator models using an unconventional system parameter and the
coupling strength as the required control parameters. The coupled oscillator
models are widely used and well-documented for studying various aspects of
nature. However, the early warning index used in this paper is an explicit
function of the mutual information of the coupled oscillators and reaches two
different values before the interacting oscillators yield complete and
generalized synchronizations. The transitions to synchrony using the
unconventional control parameter are associated with a transition to periodic
dynamics of the individual oscillators from their initial chaotic dynamics.
Besides, when we use the coupling strength as a control parameter, the
interacting oscillator exhibits chaotic dynamics during the synchronizations.
Our analysis mainly involves different examples of two low-dimensional
oscillators. Finally, we extend our study to a network of interacting
oscillators. The applicability of the early detection index is verified in all
cases.

fulfill all practical requirements of low-cost RFID such as resource limitation
of EPC Gen2 tags. This is thanks to that only simple computation modules such

neural networks by modifying the graph structure. Previous gray-box attackers
employ gradients from the surrogate model to locate the vulnerable edges to
perturb the graph structure. However, unreliability exists in gradients on
graph structures, which is rarely studied by previous works. In this paper, we
discuss and analyze the errors caused by the unreliability of the structural
gradients. These errors arise from rough gradient usage due to the discreteness
of the graph structure and from the unreliability in the meta-gradient on the
graph structure. In order to address these problems, we propose a novel attack
model with methods to reduce the errors inside the structural gradients. We
propose edge discrete sampling to select the edge perturbations associated with
hierarchical candidate selection to ensure computational efficiency. In
addition, semantic invariance and momentum gradient ensemble are proposed to
address the gradient fluctuation on semantic-augmented graphs and the
instability of the surrogate model. Experiments are conducted in untargeted
gray-box poisoning scenarios and demonstrate the improvement in the performance
of our approach.

error is used due to its simplicity, but it is not an optimal solution, as it
does not optimize distance, but square of a distance. The TLSE method,
respecting the orthogonality of a distance measurement, is computed in
d-dimensional space, i.e. for points given in E2 a line p in E2, resp. for
points given in E3 a plane in rho in E3, fitting the TLSE criteria are found.
However, some tasks in physical sciences lead to a slightly different problem.
In this paper, a new TSLE method is introduced for solving a problem when data
are given in E3 and a line p in E3 is to be found fitting the TLSE criterion.
