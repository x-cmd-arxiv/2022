applications such as DNA-based storage and racetrack memories. From a
theoretical perspective, it is interesting to know whether the same properties

In this work, we show that the equivalence between insertion and deletion
correcting codes generalizes to the $d$-dimensional space. As a particular
result, we show the following missing equivalence for arrays: a code that can
correct $t_\mathrm{r}$ and $t_\mathrm{c}$ row/column deletions can correct any

costs, unsupervised learning methods can be essential for better system
development. One of the most successful methods is contrastive self-supervised
methods, which require negative sampling: sampling alternative samples to
contrast with the current sample (anchor). However, it is hard to ensure if all
the negative samples belong to classes different from the anchor class without
labels. This paper applies a non-contrastive self-supervised learning method on
an unlabeled speech corpus to learn utterance-level embeddings. We used
DIstillation with NO labels (DINO), proposed in computer vision, and adapted it
to the speech domain. Unlike the contrastive methods, DINO does not require
negative sampling. These embeddings were evaluated on speaker verification and
emotion recognition. In speaker verification, the unsupervised DINO embedding
with cosine scoring provided 4.38% EER on the VoxCeleb1 test trial. This
outperforms the best contrastive self-supervised method by 40% relative in EER.
An iterative pseudo-labeling training pipeline, not requiring speaker labels,
further improved the EER to 1.89%. In emotion recognition, the DINO embedding
performed 60.87, 79.21, and 56.98% in micro-f1 score on IEMOCAP, Crema-D, and
MSP-Podcast, respectively. The results imply the generality of the DINO
embedding to different speech applications.

  Normalized Tensor Nuclear Norm Regularization","11 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aggregating messages is a key component for the communication of multi-agent
reinforcement learning (Comm-MARL). Recently, it has witnessed the prevalence
of graph attention networks (GAT) in Comm-MARL, where agents can be represented
as nodes and messages can be aggregated via the weighted passing. While
successful, GAT can lead to homogeneity in the strategies of message
aggregation, and the ``core'' agent may excessively influence other agents'
behaviors, which can severely limit the multi-agent coordination. To address
this challenge, we first study the adjacency tensor of the communication graph
and demonstrate that the homogeneity of message aggregation could be measured
by the normalized tensor rank. Since the rank optimization problem is known to
be NP-hard, we define a new nuclear norm, which is a convex surrogate of
normalized tensor rank, to replace the rank. Leveraging the norm, we further
propose a plug-and-play regularizer on the adjacency tensor, named Normalized
Tensor Nuclear Norm Regularization (NTNNR), to actively enrich the diversity of
message aggregation during the training stage. We extensively evaluate GAT with
the proposed regularizer in both cooperative and mixed cooperative-competitive
scenarios. The results demonstrate that aggregating messages using
NTNNR-enhanced GAT can improve the efficiency of the training and achieve
higher asymptotic performance than existing message aggregation methods. When
NTNNR is applied to existing graph-attention Comm-MARL methods, we also observe
significant performance improvements on the StarCraft II micromanagement
benchmarks.

full potential of these materials will depend on our ability to position the
Fermi level near the symmetry-protected band crossings so that their exotic
spin and charge transport properties become prominent in the devices. Recent
experiments on bulk and thin films of topological half-Heuslers show that the
Fermi level is far from the symmetry-protected crossings, leading to strong
interference from bulk bands in the observation of topologically protected
surface states. Using density functional theory calculations we explore how
intrinsic defects can be used to tune the Fermi level in the two representative
half-Heusler topological semimetals PtLuSb and PtLuBi. Our results explain
recent results of Hall and angle-resolved photoemission measurements. The
calculations show that Pt vacancies are the most abundant intrinsic defects in
these materials grown under typical growth conditions, and that these defects
lead to excess hole densities that place the Fermi level significantly below
the expected position in the pristine material. Directions for tuning the Fermi
level by tuning chemical potentials are addressed.

organically, introducing new headers and protocols to the classic TCP/IP stack.
More specifically, we have identified two major trends. First, it is common
that most communications are encrypted, either at L3 or L4. And second, due to
protocol ossification, developers have resorted to upper layers to introduce
new functionalities (L4 and above). For example, QUIC's connection migration
feature provides mobility at L4.
  In this paper we present a reflection around these changes, and attempt to
formalize them by adding two additional protocol headers to the TCP/IP stack:
one for security, and another for new functionalities. We must note that we are
not presenting a new architecture, but trying to draw up what it's already out
there. In addition, we elaborate on the forces that have brought us here, and
we enumerate current proposals that are shaping these new headers. We also

terms of their dynamical complexity and their capacity to constrain planet
formation and migration histories. The key towards making these connections,
however, is to have a reliable characterization of the resonant dynamics,
especially the so-called ""libration amplitude"", which qualitatively measures
how deep the system is into the resonance. In this work, we identify an
important complication with the interpretation of libration amplitude estimates
from observational data of resonant systems. Specifically, we show that
measurement noise causes inferences of the libration amplitude to be
systematically biased to larger values, with noisier data yielding a larger
bias. We demonstrated this through multiple approaches, including using
dynamical fits of synthetic radial velocity data to explore how the the
libration amplitude distribution inferred from the posterior parameter
distribution varies with the degree of measurement noise. We find that even
modest levels of noise still result in a slight bias. The origin of the bias
stems from the topology of the resonant phase space and the fact that the
available phase space volume increases non-uniformly with increasing libration
amplitude. We highlight strategies for mitigating the bias through the usage of
particular priors. Our results imply that many known resonant systems are
likely deeper in resonance than previously appreciated.

relationships between mining pools and participating agents. Moreover,
detecting or responding to attacks is challenging due to the nature of mining
pools. In this paper, however, we suggest that BWH attacks also have a
comparable trust problem. Because a BWH attacker cannot have complete control
over BWH agents, they can betray the belonging mining pool and seek further
benefits by trading with victims. We prove that this betrayal is not only valid
in all attack parameters but also provides double benefits; finally, it is the
best strategy for BWH agents. Furthermore, our study implies that BWH attacks
may encounter self-destruction of their own revenue, contrary to their

obtain astrophysical parameters and elemental abundances for 100,000 stars,
including large representative samples of the stellar populations in the
Galaxy, and a well-defined sample of 60 (plus 20 archive) open clusters. We
provide internally consistent results calibrated on benchmark stars and star
clusters, extending across a very wide range of abundances and ages. This
provides a legacy data set of intrinsic value, and equally a large wide-ranging
dataset that is of value for homogenisation of other and future stellar surveys
and Gaia's astrophysical parameters. This article provides an overview of the
survey methodology, the scientific aims, and the implementation, including a
description of the data processing for the GIRAFFE spectra. A companion paper
(arXiv:2206.02901) introduces the survey results. Gaia-ESO aspires to quantify
both random and systematic contributions to measurement uncertainties. Thus all
available spectroscopic analysis techniques are utilised, each spectrum being
analysed by up to several different analysis pipelines, with considerable
effort being made to homogenise and calibrate the resulting parameters. We
describe here the sequence of activities up to delivery of processed data
products to the ESO Science Archive Facility for open use. The Gaia-ESO Survey
obtained 202,000 spectra of 115,000 stars using 340 allocated VLT nights
between December 2011 and January 2018 from GIRAFFE and UVES. The full
consistently reduced final data set of spectra was released through the ESO
Science Archive Facility in late 2020, with the full astrophysical parameters
sets following in 2022.

worldwide, raising the need to develop novel tools to provide rapid and
cost-effective screening and diagnosis. Clinical reports indicated that
COVID-19 infection may cause cardiac injury, and electrocardiograms (ECG) may
serve as a diagnostic biomarker for COVID-19. This study aims to utilize ECG
signals to detect COVID-19 automatically. We propose a novel method to extract
ECG signals from ECG paper records, which are then fed into a one-dimensional
convolution neural network (1D-CNN) to learn and diagnose the disease. To
evaluate the quality of digitized signals, R peaks in the paper-based ECG
images are labeled. Afterward, RR intervals calculated from each image are
compared to RR intervals of the corresponding digitized signal. Experiments on
the COVID-19 ECG images dataset demonstrate that the proposed digitization
method is able to capture correctly the original signals, with a mean absolute
error of 28.11 ms. Our proposed 1D-CNN model, which is trained on the digitized
ECG signals, allows identifying individuals with COVID-19 and other subjects
accurately, with classification accuracies of 98.42%, 95.63%, and 98.50% for
classifying COVID-19 vs. Normal, COVID-19 vs. Abnormal Heartbeats, and COVID-19
vs. other classes, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method also achieves
a high-level of performance for the multi-classification task. Our findings
indicate that a deep learning system trained on digitized ECG signals can serve
as a potential tool for diagnosing COVID-19.

operate at a high $\beta$ value (the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure),
i.e., $\beta \sim 1$. However, a $\beta \sim 1$ state may be unstable to
various pressure- and current-driven instabilities or have unfavorable
microstability properties. To explore these possibilities, we generate $\beta
\sim 1$ equilibria and investigate their stability. Initially, we study an
analytical technique that was used in the past to generate $\beta \sim 1$
equilibria and outline its limitations. Hence, we demonstrate the generation of
high-$\beta$ equilibria with the computer code $\texttt{VMEC}$. We then analyze
these equilibria to determine their stability against the infinite-$n$ ideal
ballooning mode. We follow that by engaging in a detailed microstability study,
beginning with assessments of electrostatic ITG and TEM instabilities. We
observe interesting behavior for the high-$\beta$ equilibria -- stabilization
of these modes through two distinct mechanisms. Finally, we perform
electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations and again observe stabilizing trends in
the equilibria at high $\beta$. These trends are different from their lower
$\beta$ counterparts and offer an alternative, potentially favorable regime of
tokamak operation.

$\Lambda$ is well understood and relies on the properties of the News tensor

different when $\Lambda>0$ where there is no known notion of `News' with
similar good properties. In this paper both situations are considered jointly
from a {\em tidal} point of view, that is, taking into account the strength (or
energy) of the curvature tensors. The fundamental object used for that purposes
in the {\em asymptotic (radiant) super-momentum}, a causal vector defined at
infinity with remarkable properties. This leads to a novel characterization of
gravitational radiation valid for the general case with $\Lambda\geq 0$ that
has been proven to be equivalent, when $\Lambda =0$, to the standard one based
on News. The implications of this result are analyzed in some detail when
$\Lambda >0$. A general procedure to construct `news tensors' when $\Lambda >0$
is depicted, a proposal for asymptotic symmetries provided, and an example of a
conserved charge that may detect gravitational radiation at infinity exhibited.

optimal connections between RF chains and antennas requires solving a

could overcome such challenges by enabling screening of a larger space, but is
limited by the fidelity of the data used in ML model training, which is
typically from a single approximate density functional. To address this

Existing frame-level self-supervised speech representation, e.g., wav2vec, can
be used as utterance-level representation with pooling, but the models are
usually large. There are also SSL techniques to learn utterance-level
representation. One of the most successful is a contrastive method, which
requires negative sampling: selecting alternative samples to contrast with the
current sample (anchor). However, this does not ensure that all the negative
samples belong to classes different from the anchor class without labels. This
paper applies a non-contrastive self-supervised method to learn utterance-level
embeddings. We adapted DIstillation with NO labels (DINO) from computer vision
to speech. Unlike contrastive methods, DINO does not require negative sampling.
We compared DINO to x-vector trained in a supervised manner. When transferred
to down-stream tasks (speaker verification, speech emotion recognition (SER),
and Alzheimer's disease detection), DINO outperformed x-vector. We studied the
influence of several aspects during transfer learning such as dividing the
fine-tuning process into steps, chunk lengths, or augmentation. During
fine-tuning, tuning the last affine layers first and then the whole network
surpassed fine-tuning all at once. Using shorter chunk lengths, although they
generate more diverse inputs, did not necessarily improve performance, implying
speech segments at least with a specific length are required for better
performance per application. Augmentation was helpful in SER.

charged-particle array, CLARION2-TRINITY, are described. The TRINITY
charged-particle array is comprised of 64 Cerium-doped Gadolinium Aluminium
Gallium Garnet (GAGG:Ce) crystals configured into five rings spanning 7-54
degrees, and two annular silicon detectors that can shadow or extend the
angular coverage to backward angles with minimal $\gamma$-ray attenuation.
GAGG:Ce is a non-hygroscopic, bright, and relatively fast scintillator with a
light distribution well matched to SiPMs. Count rates up to 40 kHz per crystal
are sustainable. Fundamental characteristics of GAGG:Ce are measured and
presented, including light- and heavy-ion particle identification (PID)
capability, pulse-height defects, radiation hardness, and emission spectra. The
CLARION2 array consists of up to 16 Compton-suppressed HPGe Clover detectors
($\approx4\%$ efficiency at 1 MeV) configured into four rings (eight HPGe
crystal rings) using a non-Archimedean geometry that suppresses back-to-back
coincident 511-keV gamma rays. The entire array is instrumented with 100- and
500-MHz (14 bit) waveform digitizers which enable triggerless operation,
pulse-shape discrimination, fast timing, and pileup correction. Finally, two
examples of experimental data taken during the commissioning of the
CLARION2-TRINITY system are given: a PID spectrum from $^{16}$O + $^{18}$O
fusion-evaporation, and PID and Doppler-corrected $\gamma$-ray spectra from
$^{48}$Ti + $^{12}$C Coulomb excitation.

both EFTs are first presented for the most relevant subprocess participating in
the total process of our interest, $e^+e^- \to HH \nu \bar \nu$, which is the
scattering of two gauge bosons, $WW \to HH$, also called $WW$ fusion. The
predictions for the cross section $ \sigma(W_X W_Y\to HH)$ as a function of the
subprocess energy are analyzed in full detail for the two EFTs, for all the
polarization channels with longitudinal and transverse modes $XY=LL, TT,LT,TL$,
and for the most relevant effective operators in both cases. We will
demonstrate that in the HEFT case, the total cross section can be fully
understood in terms of the $LL$ contribution and this in turn is dominated at
these TeV energies mainly by two HEFT coefficients. By doing the matching
between the two EFTs at the level of the scattering amplitude for the
subprocess, we will be able to find the correspondence of the leading
coefficients in the HEFT and the SMEFT. In the final part of this work we will
then explore the sensitivity to these two most relevant HEFT coefficients, at
CLIC (3 TeV, 5 ab$^{-1}$) and ILC (1 TeV, 8 ab$^{-1}$). We will then conclude
on the accessible region of these two parameters by studying the predicted
rates at these two $e^+e^-$ colliders for the final state $b \bar b b \bar b

surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for enantiomeric discrimination is a
powerful approach for the analysis of optically active small organic or large
biomolecules. In this work, for enantio-selective sensing we proposed the
coupling of disposable chiral plasmonic shurikens supporting the chiral
near-field distribution with SERS active silver nanoclusters. As a result of
the plasmonic coupling significant difference in SERS response of optically
active analytes is observed. This is hypothesized and confirmed by numerical
simulations to be a consequence of the silver particles being excited by
superchiral fields generated at the surface or the probe molecules achieving
additional polarization. The plasmon coupling phenomena was found to be
extremely sensitive to slight variations in shuriken geometry, silver
nanostructured layer parameters, and SERS excitation wavelength(s). Designed
structures were able to discriminate cysteine enantiomers at concentrations in
the nanomolar range and probe biomolecular chirality, using a common Raman
spectrometer within several minutes. The combination of disposable plasmonic
substrates with specific near-field polarization can make the SERS enantiomer
discrimination a commonly available technique using standard Raman
spectrometers.

Supernova Remnant (SNR) G106.3+2.7 is a prime candidate for one of these. The
recent detection of very high energy (0.1-100 TeV) gamma rays from G106.3+2.7
may be explained either by the decay of neutral pions or inverse Compton
scattering by relativistic electrons. We report an analysis of 12 years of
Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data which shows that the GeV-TeV gamma-ray spectrum is
much harder and requires a different total electron energy than the radio and
X-ray spectra, suggesting it has a distinct, hadronic origin. The non-detection
of gamma rays below 10 GeV implies additional constraints on the relativistic
electron spectrum. A hadronic interpretation of the observed gamma rays is
strongly supported. This observation confirms the long-sought connection
between Galactic PeVatrons and SNRs. Moreover, it suggests that G106.3+2.7
could be the brightest member of a new population of SNRs whose gamma-ray

between a density of fractional charge and an external potential in the same
spatial domain. The extended functional can be applied to a molecule that has
two distantly separated locales and achieve the size consistency with a
modification to the two-step constrained search. The functional has the same
form as the one from grand canonical ensemble treatment, showing the
approximate nature of the latter. Components of this functional can be
extracted based on the Kohn-Sham assumption and with the aid of a model
external potential with a nondegeneracy condition. We show that the ensemble
density of a molecule of fractional charge is non-degenerate noninteracting

exchange energy functionals of such a density are well defined and have the
same forms as those for nonfractional systems. A correlation functional
pertaining to the fractionally occupied highest occupied molecular orbital only
is also defined. This correlation happens when the homo of a fractional
molecule contains more than one electron. The exact exchange energy is
discontinuous as the number of electrons passes through an odd integer, but its
sum with the new correlation energy is continuous. The extended density
functional of fractional charge is also applicable to well but not distantly
separated densities as an upper-bound to the exact solution. The major missing

projection $\pi$, this is not a property of any single one of $P$, $Q$, or
$\pi$ - unless $P$ and $Q$ are linearly isomorphic or unless all circuits of
$P$ are actual edge directions. Our characterizations are best possible in the
sense that there are combinations of $P$, $Q$ and $\pi$ that do not fall into
these categories, but do guarantee inheritance of all circuits.
  Our proofs are constructive and build on a range of simple classes of
polyhedra, including simplices and zonotopes, and standard constructions such
as homogenization, disjunctive programming, and Cartesian products. We add a
discussion of the class of fixed-shape partition polytopes, projections of
transportation polytopes under a geometric embedding of a data set. Despite the
many promising properties of this example, the set of circuits is not
inherited.

Moreover, we propose to regularize the smoothness of the relation evolution and
the sparsity of the inferred graphs or hypergraphs, which effectively improves
training stability and enhances the explainability of inferred relations. The

This problem can also be seen as a structured version of MinRank, which is
ubiquitous in multivariate cryptography. Recently, \cite{BBBGNRT20,BBCGPSTV20}
proposed attacks based on two new algebraic modelings, namely the MaxMinors
modeling which is specific to RD and the Support-Minors modeling which applies
to MinRank in general. Both improved significantly the complexity of algebraic
attacks on these two problems. In the case of RD and contrarily to what was
believed up to now, these new attacks were shown to be able to outperform
combinatorial attacks and this even for very small field sizes.
  However, we prove here that the analysis performed in \cite{BBCGPSTV20} for
one of these attacks which consists in mixing the MaxMinors modeling with the
Support-Minors modeling to solve RD is too optimistic and leads to
underestimate the overall complexity. This is done by exhibiting linear
dependencies between these equations and by considering an $\fqm$ version of
these modelings which turns out to be instrumental for getting a better
understanding of both systems. Moreover, by working over $\Fqm$ rather than
over $\ff{q}$, we are able to drastically reduce the number of variables in the
system and we (i) still keep enough algebraic equations to be able to solve the
system, (ii) are able to analyze rigorously the complexity of our approach.
This new approach may improve the older MaxMinors approach on RD from
\cite{BBBGNRT20,BBCGPSTV20} for certain parameters. We also introduce a new
hybrid approach on the Support-Minors system whose impact is much more general
since it applies to any MinRank problem. This technique improves significantly
the complexity of the Support-Minors approach for small to moderate field
sizes.

these galaxies to have relatively low stellar masses
$M_{\star}\sim10^7-10^8\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and young ages
$t_{\mathrm{age}}\sim10-100$\,Myr. Due to their very blue UV-slopes, down to
$\beta\sim-3$, all of the galaxies in our sample have extremely low dust
attenuations $A_V\lesssim0.02$. Placing the measured parameters into relation,
we find a very shallow $M_{\star}-M_{\mathrm{UV}}$-slope and high sSFRs above
the main sequence of star-formation with no significant redshift-evolution in
either relation. This is in agreement with the bright UV luminosities measured
for these objects and indicates that we are naturally selecting galaxies that
are currently undergoing a star-bursting episode at the time they are observed.
Finally, we discuss the robustness of our high-redshift galaxy sample regarding
low-redshift interlopers and conclude that low-redshift solutions can safely be
ruled out for roughly half of the sample, including the highest-redshift
galaxies at $z\sim12-16$. These objects represent compelling targets for

efficient management of such issue has become one of the major paradigms in

authenticated data structures like revocation trees to replace the classical
and inefficient certificate revocation lists. In particular, the idea of this
paper is to propose the use of k-ary hash trees, Huffman coding and a duplex
version of the SHA-3 hash function, to optimize insertions and searches in the
revocation structure. Thus, the inclusion of a new certificate revoked in the
tree, only implies a new iteration of the duplex construction of the hash
function, avoiding recalculating the entire hashes and the entire tree.
Furthermore, a k-ary Huffman tree is used to insert leaf nodes at different
levels so that those revoked nodes that are more queried, are located closer to
the root node position, so the revocation proof is smaller for those vehicles
that spend more time on the roads. This paper details a method to calculate the
optimum value $k$ for the k-ary tree in order to optimize the revocation proof
size. Therefore, the proposal described here improves both the insertion of new
revoked certificates in the revocation structure and the search of revoked
certificates in the revocation structure. This paper is part of a work in
progress, so that we plan to implement the scheme in real scenarios to get
ideal values of the parameters and comparisons with other schemes.

detached main-sequence eclipsing binaries (EBs) with light curves from the
Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which provides a well-understood selection
function and sensitivity to faint stars. At short periods ($P_{\rm orb}\lesssim
2$ days), binaries are predicted to evolve significantly due to magnetic
braking (MB), which shrinks orbits and ultimately brings detached binaries into
contact. The period distribution is thus a sensitive probe of MB. We find that
the intrinsic period distribution of low-mass ($0.1\lesssim M_1/M_{\odot} <
0.9$) binaries is basically flat (${\rm d}N/{\rm d}P_{\rm orb} \propto P_{\rm
orb}^0$), from $P_{\rm orb}=10$ days down to the contact limit. This is
strongly inconsistent with predictions of classical MB models based on the
Skumanich relation, which are widely used in binary evolution calculations and
predict ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}P_{\rm orb} \propto P_{\rm orb}^{7/3}$ at short
periods. The observed distributions are best reproduced by models in which the
magnetic field saturates at short periods, with a MB torque that scales roughly
as $\dot{J}\propto P_{\rm orb}^{-1}$, as opposed to $\dot{J} \propto P_{\rm
orb}^{-3}$ in the standard Skumanich law. We also find no significant
difference between the period distributions of binaries containing fully and
partially convective stars. Our results confirm that a saturated MB law, which
was previously found to describe the spin-down of rapidly rotating isolated M
dwarfs, also operates in tidally locked binaries. We advocate using saturated
MB models in binary evolution calculations. Our work supports previous
suggestions that MB in cataclysmic variables (CVs) is much weaker than assumed
in the standard evolutionary model, unless mass transfer leads to significant
additional angular momentum loss in CVs.

spectra is analysed here from a basic standpoint based on information theory.
By interpreting spectra as probability distribution functions, we find that
galaxy spectra have high entropy, thus leading to a rather low effective
information content. The highest variation in entropy is unsurprisingly found
in regions that have been well studied for decades with the conventional
approach. We target a set of six spectral regions that show the highest
variation in entropy - the 4000A break being the most informative one. As a
test case with real data, we measure the entropy of a set of high quality
spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and contrast entropy-based results
with the traditional method based on line strengths. The data are classified
into star-forming (SF), quiescent (Q) and AGN galaxies, and show, independently
of any physical model, that AGN spectra can be interpreted as a transition
between SF and Q galaxies, with SF galaxies featuring a more diverse variation
in entropy. The high level of entanglement complicates the determination of
population parameters in a robust, unbiased way, and affect traditional methods
that compare models with observations, as well as machine learning (especially
deep learning) algorithms that rely on the statistical properties of the data
to assess the variations among spectra. Entropy provides a new avenue to
improve population synthesis models so that they give a more faithful
representation of real galaxy spectra.

($R-L$ relation) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is critical for single-epoch
mass estimates of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). At $z \sim 1-2$, where AGN
activity peaks, the $R-L$ relation is constrained by the reverberation mapping
(RM) lags of the Mg II line. We present 25 Mg II lags from the Australian Dark
Energy Survey (OzDES) RM project based on six years of monitoring. We define
quantitative criteria to select good lag measurements and verify their
reliability with simulations based on both the damped random walk stochastic
model and the re-scaled, re-sampled versions of the observed lightcurves of
local, well-measured AGN. Our sample significantly increases the number of Mg
II lags and extends the $R-L$ relation to higher redshifts and luminosities.
The relative iron line strength $\mathcal{R}_{\rm Fe}$ has little impact on the
$R-L$ relation. The best-fit Mg II $R-L$ relation has a slope $\alpha = 0.39
\pm 0.08$ with an intrinsic scatter $\sigma_{\rm rl} = 0.15^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$.
The slope is consistent with previous measurements and shallower than the
H$\beta$ $R-L$ relation. The intrinsic scatter of the new $R-L$ relation is
substantially smaller than previous studies and comparable to the intrinsic
scatter of the H$\beta$ $R-L$ relation. Our new $R-L$ relation will enable more
precise single-epoch mass estimates and SMBH demographic studies at cosmic

considering both position and momentum. We find that thin planes ($20\%\cdot
R_\mathrm{halo}$) containing at least $50\%$ of the total number of satellites

of such planes are even aligned in momentum ($90\%$ of the total satellite

exhibiting systematically thicker planes. This may point towards the change
from continuous accretion of small objects along filaments and sheets for less
massive haloes to the accretion of large objects (e.g., major mergers)
dominating the growth of more massive haloes. There is no correlation between
the existence of a plane and the main galaxy's morphology. Finally, we find a

each node is specified using First-Order Logic (FOL) assume-guarantee contracts

stack-of-stars golden-angle radial sampling and tailored GRASP-Pro
(Golden-angle RAdial Sparse Parallel) reconstruction. Specifically, 4D
real-time MRI acquisition is performed continuously without motion gating or
sorting. The k-space centers in stack-of-stars radial data are organized to
guide estimation of a temporal basis, with which GRASP-Pro reconstruction is
employed to enforce joint low-rank subspace and sparsity constraints. This new
basis estimation strategy is the new feature proposed for subspace-based
reconstruction in this work to achieve high temporal resolution (e.g.,
sub-second/3D volume). It does not require sequence modification to acquire
additional navigation data, is compatible with commercially available
stack-of-stars sequences, and does not need an intermediate reconstruction
step. The proposed 4D real-time MRI approach was tested in abdominal motion
phantom, free-breathing abdominal MRI, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI
(DCE-MRI). With the ability to acquire each 3D image in less than one second,
intra-frame respiratory blurring can be intrinsically reduced for body
applications with our approach, which also eliminates the need for motion
detection and motion compensation.

particular, we prove that ballistic growth is impossible when the distribution
of coupling strengths $\mu(J)$ has a sufficiently heavy tail at small $J$, and
identify the correct dynamical exponent to use instead. Furthermore, through a
detailed analysis of the special case in which the couplings are genuinely
random and independent, we find that the standard formulation of Lieb-Robinson
bounds is insufficient to capture the complexity of the dynamics -- we must
distinguish between bounds which hold for all sites of the chain and bounds
which hold for a subsequence of sites, and we show by explicit example that
these two can have dramatically different behaviors. All the same, our result
for the dynamical exponent is tight, in that we prove by counterexample that
there cannot exist any Lieb-Robinson bound with a smaller exponent. We close by
discussing the implications of our results, both major and minor, for numerous
applications ranging from quench dynamics to the structure of ground states.

emissivities of three major contributors: free-free, thermal dust emission, and
AME. In particular, for spinning nanoparticles (i.e., potential carriers of
AME), we consider a known grain destruction mechanism due to a centrifugal
force from spin-up processes caused by collisions between dust grains and
supersonic neutral streams in a magnetized shock (C-shock). We demonstrate
that, if the ISM in a magnetic field is impacted by a C-shock developed by a
supernova explosion in the early phase of massive star-formation ($\lesssim 10$
Myr), AME can be significantly or almost entirely suppressed relative to
free-free and thermal dust continuum emission if the grain tensile strength is
small enough. This study may shed light on explaining the rare observations of
AME from extragalactic star-forming regions preferentially observed from
massive star clusters and suggest a scenario of ""the rise and fall of AME"" in

the geometry of class embeddings and classifier weights, found by deep nets

holds for balanced data. Here we thus ask whether it can be made invariant to
class imbalances. Towards this end, we adopt the unconstrained-features model
(UFM), a recent theoretical model for studying neural collapse, and introduce
Simplex-Encoded-Labels Interpolation (SELI) as an invariant characterization of
the neural collapse phenomenon. Specifically, we prove for the UFM with
cross-entropy loss and vanishing regularization that, irrespective of class
imbalances, the embeddings and classifiers always interpolate a simplex-encoded
label matrix and that their individual geometries are determined by the SVD
factors of this same label matrix. We then present extensive experiments on
synthetic and real datasets that confirm convergence to the SELI geometry.
However, we caution that convergence worsens with increasing imbalances. We
theoretically support this finding by showing that unlike the balanced case,
when minorities are present, ridge-regularization plays a critical role in
tweaking the geometry. This defines new questions and motivates further
investigations into the impact of class imbalances on the rates at which
first-order methods converge to their asymptotically preferred solutions.

the robustness of the best individual data source. We complement our empirical

$\beta$-effect is naturally present because of the curvature of the free
surface. Instantaneous turbulent zonal jets spontaneously emerge from the
small-scale forcing, equilibrate at large scale, and can contain up to 70% of
the total kinetic energy of the flow once in a quasi-steady state. We show that
the spectral properties of the experimental flows are consistent with the

this paper, analytical expressions for maximal reflected power in any direction
and for any polarization are given for generic planar structures made of a
single material represented by a complex scalar susceptibility. The problem of
optimal light-matter interactions to maximize reflections is formulated as the
solution of an optimization problem in terms of the induced currents, subject
to energy conservation and passivity, which admits a global upper bound by
using Lagrangian duality. The derived upper bounds apply to a broad range of
planar structures, including metasurfaces, gratings, homogenized films,
photonic crystal slabs, and more generally, any inhomogeneous planar structure
irrespective of its geometrical details. These bounds also set the limit on the
minimum possible thickness, for a given lossy material, to achieve a desired
reflectance. Moreover, our results allow discovering parameter regions where
large improvements in the efficiency of a reflective structure are possible
compared to existing designs. Examples are given of the implications of these
findings for the design of superior and compact reflective components made of
real, imperfect (i.e., lossy) materials, such as ultra-thin and efficient

(0.02\,$<$\,z\,$<$\,0.06) massive ($M_{*}/M_{\odot}$\,$>$\,$10^9$) edge-on
disks from SDSS. We find that U-types show on average bluer optical colors and
higher specific star formation rate (sSFR) than S-types, with more strongly
warped U-types having higher sSFR. We also find that while the S-type warp
properties correlate with the tidal force by the nearest neighbor regardless of
the environment, there is no such correlation for U-types in groups/clusters,
suggesting a non-tidal environmental could be at play for U-types, such as ram
pressure stripping (RPS). Indeed, U-types are more common in groups/clusters
than in fields and they have stellar mass, gas fraction, sSFR enhancement and
phase-space distribution closely analogous to RPS-induced jellyfish galaxies in
clusters. We furthermore show that the stellar disks of most RPS galaxies in
the IllustirsTNG simulation are warped in U-shape and bent in opposite
direction of stripped gas tails, satisfying theoretical expectations for
stellar warps embeded in jellyfishes. We therefore suggest that despite the
majority of U-types that live in fields being still less explained, RPS can be
an alternative origin for those in groups/clusters.

source population could be reasonably extrapolated to another target
population, the so-called ""transportability"" problem. While most of these works
focus on a setting with two populations, many recent works have also provided
the identifiability of a causal parameter when multiple data sources are
available, under certain homogeneity assumptions. However, we know of little
work examining transportability when data sources are possibly heterogeneous,
e.g. in the distribution of mediators of the exposure-outcome relation. The
presence of such heterogeneity generally invalidates the transportability
assumption required in most of the literature. In this paper, we will propose a
general approach for heterogeneity assessment when estimating the average
exposure effect in a target population, with mediator and outcome data obtained
from multiple external sources. To account for heterogeneity, we define
different effect estimands when the mediator and outcome information is
transported from different sources. We discuss the causal assumptions to
identify these estimands, then propose efficient semi-parametric estimation
strategies that allow the use of flexible data-adaptive machine learning
methods to estimate the nuisance parameters. We also propose two new methods to
investigate sources of heterogeneity in the transported estimates. These
methods will inform users about how much of the observed statistical
heterogeneity in the transported effects is due to the differences across data
sources in: 1) conditional distribution of mediator variables, and/or 2)
conditional distribution of the outcome. We illustrate the proposed methods
using four sites that were part of the Moving to Opportunity Study, which was

kinetic axion on $R^2$ inflation. Due to the fact that the kinetic axion
possesses a large kinetic energy which dominates its potential energy, during
inflation its energy density redshifts as stiff matter fluid and evolves in a
constant-roll way, making the second slow-roll index to be non-trivial. At the
equations of motion level, the $R^2$ term dominates the evolution, thus the
next possible effect of the axion could be found at the cosmological
perturbations level, via the second slow-roll index which is non-trivial. As we
show, the latter elegantly cancels from the observational indices, however, the
kinetic axion extends the duration of the inflationary era to an extent that it
may cause a 15$\%$ decrease in the tensor-to-scalar ratio of the vacuum $R^2$
model. This occurs because as the $R^2$ model approaches its unstable quasi-de
Sitter attractor in the phase space of $F(R)$ gravity due to the $\langle R^2
\rangle $ fluctuations, the kinetic axion dominates over the $R^2$ inflation
and in effect the background equation of state is described by a stiff era, or
equivalently a kination era, different from the ordinary radiation domination
era. This in turn affects the duration of the inflationary era, increasing the
$e$-foldings number up to $5$ $e$-foldings in some cases, depending on the
reheating temperature, which in turn has a significant quantitative effect on
the observational indices of inflation and especially on the tensor-to-scalar
ratio.

paper frames. We develop a video processing pipeline that takes retinoscopic
videos as input and estimates the net refractive error based on our proposed
extension of the retinoscopy mathematical model. Our system alleviates the need
for a lens kit and can be performed by an untrained examiner. In a clinical
trial with 185 eyes, we achieved a sensitivity of 91.0% and specificity of
74.0% on refractive error diagnosis. Moreover, the mean absolute error of our
approach was 0.75$\pm$0.67D on net refractive error estimation compared to
subjective refraction measurements. Our results indicate that our approach has
the potential to be used as a retinoscopy-based refractive error screening tool
in real-world medical settings.

treatment assignment of those in their social network, is pervasive in
real-world settings. However, it poses a challenge to estimating causal
effects. We consider the task of estimating the total treatment effect (TTE),
or the difference between the average outcomes of the population when everyone
is treated versus when no one is, under network interference. Under a Bernoulli
randomized design, we provide an unbiased estimator for the TTE when network
interference effects are constrained to low order interactions among neighbors
of an individual. We make no assumptions on the graph other than bounded
degree, allowing for well-connected networks that may not be easily clustered.
We derive a bound on the variance of our estimator and show in simulated
experiments that it performs well compared with standard estimators for the
TTE. We also derive a minimax lower bound on the mean squared error of our
estimator which suggests that the difficulty of estimation can be characterized
by the degree of interactions in the potential outcomes model. We also prove
that our estimator is asymptotically normal under boundedness conditions on the
network degree and potential outcomes model. Central to our contribution is a
new framework for balancing model flexibility and statistical complexity as
captured by this low order interactions structure.

are difficult to process via dry etching . For this reason, etching tightly
confining waveguides - routinely achieved in silicon or silicon nitride - has
not been possible. Diamond-like carbon (DLC) was discovered in the 1950s and is
a material that exhibits an amorphous phase, excellent hardness, and the
ability to be deposited in nano-metric thin films. It has excellent thermal,

Here we demonstrate that DLC is also a superior material for the manufacturing
of next-generation photonic integrated circuits based on ferroelectrics,
specifically Lithium Niobate on insulator (LNOI). Using DLC as a hard mask, we
demonstrate the fabrication of deeply etched, tightly confining, low loss
photonic integrated circuits with losses as low as 5.6 dB/m. In contrast to
widely employed ridge waveguides, this approach benefits from a more than 1
order of magnitude higher area integration density while maintaining efficient

state molecules has been debated due to the possibly high density of states
and/or rapid decay of the resonant complex. Here we report a very pronounced
and narrow (25 mG) Feshbach resonance in collisions between two ground state
NaLi molecules. This molecular Feshbach resonance has two special
characteristics. First, the collisional loss rate is enhanced by more than two
orders of magnitude above the background loss rate which is saturated at the
$p$-wave universal value, due to strong chemical reactivity. Second, the
resonance is located at a magnetic field where two open channels become nearly
degenerate. This implies the intermediate complex predominantly decays to the
second open channel. We describe the resonant loss feature using a model with
coupled modes which is analogous to a Fabry-P\'erot cavity. Our observations
prove the existence of long-lived coherent intermediate complexes even in
systems without reaction barriers and open up the possibility of coherent

compare half-duplex communication, existential B-boundedness, and
k-synchronisability. These restrictions do not prevent the communication
channels from growing arbitrarily large but still restrict the power of the

incomparable. We investigate their relationship in two different contexts:
first, the one of communicating state machines, and, second, the one of
communication protocol specifications using high-level message sequence charts.
Surprisingly, these two contexts yield different conclusions. In addition, we
integrate multiparty session types, another approach to specify communication
protocols, into our classification. We show that multiparty session type

  Detection Integrated",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Clustering analysis is one of the critical tasks in machine learning.
Traditionally, clustering has been an independent task, separate from outlier
detection. Due to the fact that the performance of clustering can be
significantly eroded by outliers, a small number of algorithms try to
incorporate outlier detection in the process of clustering. However, most of
those algorithms are based on unsupervised partition-based algorithms such as
k-means. Given the nature of those algorithms, they often fail to deal with
clusters of complex, non-convex shapes. To tackle this challenge, we have
proposed SSDBCODI, a semi-supervised density-based algorithm. SSDBCODI combines
the advantage of density-based algorithms, which are capable of dealing with
clusters of complex shapes, with the semi-supervised element, which offers
flexibility to adjust the clustering results based on a few user labels. We
also merge an outlier detection component with the clustering process.
Potential outliers are detected based on three scores generated during the
process: (1) reachability-score, which measures how density-reachable a point
is to a labeled normal object, (2) local-density-score, which measures the
neighboring density of data objects, and (3) similarity-score, which measures
the closeness of a point to its nearest labeled outliers. Then in the following
step, instance weights are generated for each data instance based on those
three scores before being used to train a classifier for further clustering and
outlier detection. To enhance the understanding of the proposed algorithm, for
our evaluation, we have run our proposed algorithm against some of the
state-of-art approaches on multiple datasets and separately listed the results
of outlier detection apart from clustering. Our results indicate that our
algorithm can achieve superior results with a small percentage of labels.

dayside cloud patterns are shaped by the wind flow and irradiation. Surface
gravity and planetary rotation have little effect. Extended atmosphere profiles
suggest the formation of mineral haze in form of metal-oxide clusters (e.g.
(TiO2)_N). The dayside cloud coverage is the tell-tale sign for the different
planetary regimes and their resulting weather and climate appearance. Class (i)
is representative of planets with a very homogeneous cloud particle size and
material compositions across the globe (e.g., HATS-6b, NGTS-1b), classes (ii,

homogeneously affected in class (i), but asymmetrically in class (ii) and

employ substantial specialization and division of labor. Unlike most other
animals, humans learn by trial and error during their lives what role to take
on. However, when some critical roles are more attractive than others, and
individuals are self-interested, then there is a social dilemma: each
individual would prefer others take on the critical-but-unremunerative roles so
they may remain free to take one that pays better. But disaster occurs if all
act thusly and a critical role goes unfilled. In such situations learning an
optimum role distribution may not be possible. Consequently, a fundamental
question is: how can division of labor emerge in groups of self-interested
lifetime-learning individuals? Here we show that by introducing a model of
social norms, which we regard as patterns of decentralized social sanctioning,
it becomes possible for groups of self-interested individuals to learn a
productive division of labor involving all critical roles. Such social norms
work by redistributing rewards within the population to disincentivize
antisocial roles while incentivizing prosocial roles that do not intrinsically
pay as well as others.

demonstrate a method to tune the interaction between a TLS, implemented as a
flux qubit, and a transmission line waveguide from a decoupled state to a
coupling strength that is a significant fraction of the TLS transition
frequency, near the ultra-strong coupling regime. The coupling, controlled via
magnetic flux, is described by a normalized coupling strength $\alpha$ that is
measured to range between $6.2\times10^{-5}$ and $2.19\times10^{-2}$, with
larger attainable maximum values predicted by a circuit model of the device.
This system enables future investigations in the dynamics of the spin-boson

activities, and are known to be significant indicators of work productivity
(e.g., bug fixing efficiency). Recent studies have shown that directly applying
general purpose emotion classification tools to SE corpora is not effective.
Even within the SE domain, tool performance degrades significantly when trained

significant effort since manually annotating large datasets of ground truth

  In this paper, we address this data scarcity problem by automatically
creating new training data using a data augmentation technique. Based on an

improve the performance of emotion recognition. Our results show an average
improvement of 9.3% in micro F1-Score for three existing emotion classification

fact that many non-obvious factors are involved in the estimation of relevance,
inducing nonlinear interrelations between the data. The ability to model
complex dependency relationships between random variables has become
increasingly popular in the realm of information retrieval, and the need to
further explore these dependencies for data fusion has been recently
acknowledged. Copulas provide a framework to separate the dependence structure
from the margins. Inspired by the theory of copulas, we propose a new
unsupervised, dynamic, nonlinear, rank fusion method, based on a nested
composition of non-algebraic function pairs. The dependence structure of the
model is tailored by leveraging query-document correlations on a per-query
basis. We experimented with three topic sets over CLEF corpora fusing 3 and 6

approach improves performance under explicit conditions, providing insight
about the circumstances under which linear fusion techniques have comparable

resurgence of ML stimulate the latest trend of edge AI. However, recent FL
methods face major challenges including communication bottleneck, data
heterogeneity and security concerns in edge IoT scenarios, especially when
being adopted for distributed learning among massive IoT devices equipped with
limited data and transmission resources. Meanwhile, the swarm nature of IoT
systems is overlooked by most existing literature, which calls for new designs
of distributed learning algorithms. Inspired by the success of biological
intelligence (BI) of gregarious organisms, we propose a novel edge learning
approach for swarm IoT, called communication-efficient and Byzantine-robust
distributed swarm learning (CB-DSL), through a holistic integration of
AI-enabled stochastic gradient descent and BI-enabled particle swarm
optimization. To deal with non-i.i.d. data issues and Byzantine attacks, global
data samples are introduced in CB-DSL and shared among IoT workers, which not
only alleviates the local data heterogeneity effectively but also enables to
fully utilize the exploration-exploitation mechanism of swarm intelligence.
Further, we provide convergence analysis to theoretically demonstrate that the
proposed CB-DSL is superior to the standard FL with better convergence
behavior. In addition, to measure the effectiveness of the introduction of the
globally shared dataset, we also evaluate the model divergence by deriving its
upper bound, which is related to the distance between the data distribution at
local IoT devices and the population distribution for the whole datasets.
Numerical results verify that the proposed CB-DSL outperforms the existing
benchmarks in terms of faster convergence speed, higher convergent accuracy,
lower communication cost, and better robustness against non-i.i.d. data and
Byzantine attacks.

$k\sigma_{\rm avg}$ is an offset where $Q\sim 0$, the power-law scaling
exponent $\beta=d-1/2$, and $d$ is the spatial dimension. Recent studies of
hopper flows of deformable particles in different background fluids suggest
that the particle stiffness and dissipation mechanism can also strongly affect
the power-law scaling exponent $\beta$. We carry out computational studies of
hopper flows of deformable particles with both kinetic friction and background
fluid dissipation in two and three dimensions. We show that the exponent
$\beta$ varies continuously with the ratio of the viscous drag to the kinetic
friction coefficient, $\lambda=\zeta/\mu$. $\beta = d-1/2$ in the $\lambda
\rightarrow 0$ limit and $d-3/2$ in the $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$ limit,
with a midpoint $\lambda_c$ that depends on the hopper opening angle
$\theta_w$. We also characterize the spatial structure of the flows and
associate changes in spatial structure of the hopper flows to changes in the
exponent $\beta$. The offset $k$ increases with particle stiffness until $k
\sim k_{\rm max}$ in the hard-particle limit, where $k_{\rm max} \sim 3.5$ is
larger for $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$ compared to that for $\lambda

platings were similarly suited for UCN storage with an average loss probability
per wall bounce of $2.8\cdot10^{-4}$ to $4.1\cdot10^{-4}$ for energies between
90 neV and 190 neV, or a ratio of imaginary to real Fermi potential $\eta$ of
$1.7\cdot10^{-4}$ to $3.3\cdot10^{-4}$. Measurements at different elevations
indicate that the energy dependence of UCN losses is well described by the
imaginary Fermi potential. Some special considerations are required to avoid an
increase in surface roughness during the plating process and hence a reduction
in UCN transmission. Increased roughness had only a minor impact on storage
properties. Based on these findings we chose a vendor to plate the
UCN-production vessel that will contain the superfluid-helium converter for the
new TRIUMF UltraCold Advanced Neutron (TUCAN) source, achieving acceptable
UCN-storage properties with ${\eta=3.5(5)\cdot10^{-4}}$.

rotating more rapidly than the polar regions. This form of differential
rotation, also observed in many other low-mass stars, is understood to arise
when Coriolis effects are stronger than those associated with buoyant driving
of the convection. When buoyancy dominates, a so-called antisolar state of
differential rotation results, characterized by rapidly-rotating poles and a
slow equator. The transition between these two states has been shown to occur
when the intensity of these two forces is roughly equal or, equivalently, when
the convective Rossby number of the system is unity. Here we consider an
alternative view of the transition that relates this phenomenon to convective
structure and convective-zone depth. Using a series of 3-D rotating
convection-zone simulations, we demonstrate that the solar/antisolar transition
occurs when the columnar convective structures characteristic of rotating
convection attain a diameter roughly equivalent to the shell depth. When the
characteristic convective wavelength exceeds twice the shell depth, we find
that the coherent convective structures necessary to sustain an equatorward
Reynolds stress are lost, and an antisolar state results. We conclude by
presenting a force-balance analysis that relates this geometric interpretation
of the transition to the convective-Rossby-number criteria identified in
previous studies.

classification tasks. However, there are still settings where their zero-shot

improve accuracy on specific tasks without degrading accuracy on tasks where
performance is already adequate. Towards this goal, we introduce PAINT, a
patching method that uses interpolations between the weights of a model before
fine-tuning and the weights after fine-tuning on a task to be patched. On nine
tasks where zero-shot CLIP performs poorly, PAINT increases accuracy by 15 to
60 percentage points while preserving accuracy on ImageNet within one
percentage point of the zero-shot model. PAINT also allows a single model to be
patched on multiple tasks and improves with model scale. Furthermore, we
identify cases of broad transfer, where patching on one task increases accuracy
on other tasks even when the tasks have disjoint classes. Finally, we
investigate applications beyond common benchmarks such as counting or reducing
the impact of typographic attacks on CLIP. Our findings demonstrate that it is
possible to expand the set of tasks on which open-vocabulary models achieve
high accuracy without re-training them from scratch.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to augment the datasets with synthetic

synthetic images, several evaluation metrics, such as Multi-Scale Structural
Similarity Index (MS-SSIM), Cosine Distance (CD), and Fr\'echet Inception
Distance (FID) are used. Understanding the effectiveness of each metric in
evaluating the quality and diversity of GAN-based synthetic images is critical
to select images for augmentation. To date, there has been limited analysis of
the appropriateness of these metrics in the context of biomedical imagery. This
work contributes an empirical assessment of these evaluation metrics as applied
to synthetic Proliferative DR imagery generated by a Deep Convolutional GAN

tradeoff between increasing pattern gain to reduce the interference as well as
to compensate large path loss at mmWave frequencies and decreasing it to

traditional Shor scheme handles ancilla preparation and measurement faults by
performing syndrome measurements until the syndromes are repeated $t+1$ times
in a row; in the worst-case scenario, $(t+1)^2$ rounds of measurements are
required. In this work, we improve the Shor FTEC scheme using an adaptive
syndrome measurement technique. The syndrome for error correction is determined
based on information from the differences of syndromes obtained from
consecutive rounds. Our protocols that satisfy the strong and the weak FTEC
conditions require no more than $(t+3)^2/4-1$ rounds and $(t+3)^2/4-2$ rounds,
respectively, and are applicable to any stabilizer code. Our simulations of
FTEC protocols with the adaptive schemes on hexagonal color codes of small

science and technology. The existing techniques for equations discovery are
dependent on both input and state measurements; however, in practice, we only
have access to the output measurements only. We here propose a novel framework
for learning governing physics of dynamical system from output only
measurements; this essentially transfers the physics discovery problem from the
deterministic to the stochastic domain. The proposed approach models the input
as a stochastic process and blends concepts of stochastic calculus, sparse
learning algorithms, and Bayesian statistics. In particular, we combine
sparsity promoting spike and slab prior, Bayes law, and Euler Maruyama scheme
to identify the governing physics from data. The resulting model is highly
efficient and works with sparse, noisy, and incomplete output measurements. The
efficacy and robustness of the proposed approach is illustrated on several
numerical examples involving both complete and partial state measurements. The
results obtained indicate the potential of the proposed approach in identifying
governing physics from output only measurement.

these using two forms of spectral reciprocity. The first is a form of

$\mathrm{GL}_1$ moment of $\mathrm{GL}_4\times\mathrm{GL}_1$ Rankin-Selberg

directions in the generation domain due to the vast untapped potential of
incorporating multiple modalities and the wide range of fashion image
applications. To facilitate accurate generation, cross-modal synthesis methods
typically rely on Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to align
textual and garment information. In this work, we argue that simply aligning
texture and garment information is not sufficient to capture the semantics of
the visual information and therefore propose MaskCLIP. MaskCLIP decomposes the
garments into semantic parts, ensuring fine-grained and semantically accurate
alignment between the visual and text information. Building on MaskCLIP, we
propose ARMANI, a unified cross-modal fashion designer with part-level
garment-text alignment. ARMANI discretizes an image into uniform tokens based
on a learned cross-modal codebook in its first stage and uses a Transformer to
model the distribution of image tokens for a real image given the tokens of the
control signals in its second stage. Contrary to prior approaches that also
rely on two-stage paradigms, ARMANI introduces textual tokens into the
codebook, making it possible for the model to utilize fine-grain semantic
information to generate more realistic images. Further, by introducing a
cross-modal Transformer, ARMANI is versatile and can accomplish image synthesis
from various control signals, such as pure text, sketch images, and partial
images. Extensive experiments conducted on our newly collected cross-modal
fashion dataset demonstrate that ARMANI generates photo-realistic images in
diverse synthesis tasks and outperforms existing state-of-the-art cross-modal

models has drawn much attention over the past decade mainly because it
guarantees that the band structures calculated under open boundary conditions
be the same as those calculated under periodic boundary conditions. PT symmetry
in electromagnetic (EM) models, which are usually borrowed from electronic
models, has also been of immense interest mainly because it leads to
'exceptional' parameter values below which non-Hermitian operators have real
eigenvalues, although PT symmetry is not the sole symmetry which allows such
exceptional parameter values. In this article, we examine one-dimensional
PT-symmetric non-Hermitian EM models to introduce novel concepts and phenomena.
We introduce the band-structure concept of 'fixed points', which leads to
'bidirectional' reflection zeros in the corresponding finite structures,
contrary to a common belief about the EM structures with PT symmetry (and
without P and T symmetries). Some of the fixed points manifest themselves as
what we name 'extended states in the bandgap' on the band structure while some
other fixed points are the 'turning points' of the band structure. The extended
states in the band gap are in fact the dual of the well-known 'bound states in
the continuum' while the turning points allow us to observe 'ideal'
superluminal tunneling in the corresponding finite structures. By 'ideal'
superluminal tunneling we mean the case where not only the transmission
coefficient has an almost uniform phase over a broad bandwidth but also the
magnitudes of the transmission and reflection coefficients are almost equal to
unity and zero, respectively, over the bandwidth.

treats the VDOF as an isospin in addition to the regular spin. Our treatment is

good quantum numbers for both the spin and the valley isospin. This reveals an
underlying SU(4) $\supset$ SU(2) $\times$ SU(2) group-chain organization in the
Si double-dot spectra. With parameters in the range of actual experimental
situations, we demonstrate in a double-dot qubit that, in the (2,0) charge

single-particle (orbital) energy gap, the strong $e-e$ interactions drastically
quench the spin-singlet$-$spin-triplet energy gap, $E_{\rm ST}$, within the

two valleys. We present results for both the $E_{\rm ST} < E_V$ and $E_{\rm ST}

demonstrate the strengthening of the avoided crossings due to a lowering of the
interdot barrier and/or the influence of valley-orbit coupling. We further
demonstrate, as a function of an applied magnetic field, the emergence of
avoided crossings in the (1,1) charge configuration due to the spin-valley

as models of intransitive competition between three or more species. When
populations are assumed to be well-mixed, a system of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) describes the interaction model. Spatially extending these
equations with diffusion terms creates a system of partial differential
equations which captures both the spatial distribution and mobility of species.
In one spatial dimension, travelling wave solutions can be observed, which
correspond to periodic orbits in ODEs that describe the system in a
steady-state travelling frame of reference. These new ODEs also contain a
heteroclinic structure. For three species in cyclic competition, the topology
of the heteroclinic cycle in the well-mixed model is preserved in the
steady-state travelling frame of reference. We demonstrate that with four
species, the heteroclinic cycle which exists in the well-mixed system becomes a
heteroclinic network in the travelling frame of reference, with additional
heteroclinic orbits connecting equilibria not connected in the original cycle.
We find new types of travelling waves which are created in symmetry-breaking
bifurcations and destroyed in an orbit flip bifurcation with a cycle between
only two species. These new cycles explain the existence of ""defensive
alliances"" observed in previous numerical experiments. We further describe the
structure of the heteroclitic network for any number of species, and we
conjecture how these results may generalise to systems of any arbitrary number

large-scale machine learning, but also make model training time-consuming and
model storage difficult. To address the above issues in the distributed model
training setting which has high computation efficiency and less device
limitation, there are still two main difficulties. On one hand, the
communication costs for exchanging information, e.g., stochastic gradients
among different workers, is a key bottleneck for distributed training
efficiency. On the other hand, less parameter model is easy for storage and
communication, but the risk of damaging the model performance. To balance the
communication costs, model capacity and model performance simultaneously, we
propose quantized composite mirror descent adaptive subgradient (QCMD adagrad)
and quantized regularized dual average adaptive subgradient (QRDA adagrad) for
distributed training. To be specific, we explore the combination of gradient
quantization and sparse model to reduce the communication cost per iteration in
distributed training. A quantized gradient-based adaptive learning rate matrix
is constructed to achieve a balance between communication costs, accuracy, and
model sparsity. Moreover, we theoretically find that a large quantization error
brings in extra noise, which influences the convergence and sparsity of the
model. Therefore, a threshold quantization strategy with a relatively small
error is adopted in QCMD adagrad and QRDA adagrad to improve the
signal-to-noise ratio and preserve the sparsity of the model. Both theoretical
analyses and empirical results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the
proposed algorithms.

first layer. When applying such a type of network on the graph without node
features, one can extract simple graph-based node features (e.g., number of
degrees) or learn the input node representations (i.e., embeddings) when
training the network. While the latter approach, which trains node embeddings,
more likely leads to better performance, the number of parameters associated
with the embeddings grows linearly with the number of nodes. It is therefore
impractical to train the input node embeddings together with GNNs within
graphics processing unit (GPU) memory in an end-to-end fashion when dealing
with industrial-scale graph data. Inspired by the embedding compression methods
developed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, we develop a node
embedding compression method where each node is compactly represented with a
bit vector instead of a floating-point vector. The parameters utilized in the
compression method can be trained together with GNNs. We show that the proposed
node embedding compression method achieves superior performance compared to the
alternatives.

fibers have been implemented on metropolitan and intercity scales. One of the
bottlenecks lies in the exponential decay of the key rate with respect to the
transmission distance. Recently proposed schemes mainly focus on achieving
longer distances by creating a long-arm single-photon interferometer over two
communication parties. Despite their advantageous performance over long
communication distances, the requirement of phase-locking between two
independent lasers is technically challenging. By adopting the
recently-proposed mode-pairing idea, we realize high-performance quantum key
distribution without global phase-locking. Using two independent off-the-shelf
lasers, we show a quadratic key-rate improvement over the conventional
measurement-device-independent schemes in the regime of metropolitan and
intercity distances. For longer distances, we also boost the key rate
performance by three orders of magnitude via 304 km commercial fiber and 407 km
ultra-low-loss fiber. We expect this ready-to-implement high-performance scheme
to be widely used in future intercity quantum communication networks.

adversarial example crafted on a known model to also fool unknown models - have
recently received much attention due to their practicality. Nevertheless,
existing transferable attacks craft perturbations in a deterministic manner and
often fail to fully explore the loss surface, thus falling into a poor local
optimum and suffering from low transferability. To solve this problem, we
propose Attentive-Diversity Attack (ADA), which disrupts diverse salient
features in a stochastic manner to improve transferability. Primarily, we
perturb the image attention to disrupt universal features shared by different
models. Then, to effectively avoid poor local optima, we disrupt these features
in a stochastic manner and explore the search space of transferable
perturbations more exhaustively. More specifically, we use a generator to
produce adversarial perturbations that each disturbs features in different ways
depending on an input latent code. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, outperforming the transferability
of state-of-the-art methods. Codes are available at

For an initial condition with a simple pole in each of the upper- and
lower-half planes, we apply formal asymptotics in the small- and large-time

This inner problem also reveals whether or not the closest singularity to the

exact solution, apply method of steepest descents, and implement the AAA
approximation to track the complex singularities. Connections are made between
the motion of the closest singularity to the real axis and the steepness of the

Most of the contemporary dense retrieval literature presents two shortcomings
in these settings. (1) They learn an almost equal number of representations per
document, agnostic to the fact that a few head documents are disproportionately
more critical to achieving a good retrieval performance. (ii) They learn purely
semantic document representations inferred from intrinsic document
characteristics which may not contain adequate information to determine the
queries for which the document is relevant--especially when the document is
short. We propose to overcome these limitations by augmenting semantic document
representations learned by bi-encoders with behavioral document representations

  Segmentation using Contextual Regularization and Cross Knowledge Distillation","12 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables; Accepted by IEEE TMI",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in 3D medical image
segmentation relies on massive fully annotated 3D volumes for training that are
time-consuming and labor-intensive to acquire. In this paper, we propose to
annotate a segmentation target with only seven points in 3D medical images, and
design a two-stage weakly supervised learning framework PA-Seg. In the first
stage, we employ geodesic distance transform to expand the seed points to
provide more supervision signal. To further deal with unannotated image regions
during training, we propose two contextual regularization strategies, i.e.,
multi-view Conditional Random Field (mCRF) loss and Variance Minimization (VM)
loss, where the first one encourages pixels with similar features to have
consistent labels, and the second one minimizes the intensity variance for the
segmented foreground and background, respectively. In the second stage, we use
predictions obtained by the model pre-trained in the first stage as pseudo
labels. To overcome noises in the pseudo labels, we introduce a Self and Cross
Monitoring (SCM) strategy, which combines self-training with Cross Knowledge
Distillation (CKD) between a primary model and an auxiliary model that learn
from soft labels generated by each other. Experiments on public datasets for
Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) segmentation and Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS)
demonstrated that our model trained in the first stage outperformed existing
state-of-the-art weakly supervised approaches by a large margin, and after
using SCM for additional training, the model's performance was close to its
fully supervised counterpart on the BraTS dataset.

fast recovery times, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs)
have become a critical component in these applications. The operation of SNSPDs
based on conventional superconductors, which have a low critical temperature
($T_c$), requires costly and bulky cryocoolers. This motivated exploration of
other superconducting materials with higher $T_c$ that would enable
single-photon detection at elevated temperatures, yet this task has proven
exceedingly difficult. Here we show that with proper processing, high-$T_c$
cuprate superconductors can meet this challenge. We fabricated superconducting
nanowires (SNWs) out of thin flakes of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ and
La$_{1.55}$Sr$_{0.45}$CuO$_4$/La$_2$CuO$_4$ (LSCO-LCO) bilayer films and
demonstrated their single-photon response up to $25$ and $8$ K, respectively.
The single-photon operation is revealed through the linear scaling of the
photon count rate (PCR) on the radiation power. Both of our cuprate-based
SNSPDs exhibited single-photon sensitivity at the technologically-important
$1.5$ ${\mu}$m telecommunications wavelength. Our work expands the family of
superconducting materials for SNSPD technology, opens the prospects of raising

employ the coarse-grained Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model of DNA to study
relaxation dynamics of large bubbles in homopolymer DNA, using simulations up
to the microsecond time scale. By studying energy autocorrelation functions of
relatively large bubbles inserted into thermalised DNA molecules, we extract
characteristic relaxation times from the equilibration process for both
adenine-thymine (AT) and guanine-cytosine (GC) homopolymers. Bubbles of
different amplitudes and widths are investigated through extensive statistics
and appropriate fittings of their relaxation. Characteristic relaxation times
increase with bubble height and width. We show that, within the model,
relaxation times are two orders of magnitude longer in GC sequences than in AT
sequences. Overall, our results confirm that large bubbles leave a lasting
impact on the molecule's dynamics, for times between 0.4-200ns depending on the
homopolymer type and bubble shape, thus clearly affecting long-time evolutions

and storage, computation, and communication facilities to the vehicles through
Roadside Units (RSUs). Nevertheless, RSUs are often easy targets for security
assaults due to their placement in an open, unprotected environment and
resource-constrained nature. The malicious RSUs compromised by security attacks
impose threats to human safety by impeding the operations of VANETs. Hence, an
effective malevolent RSU detection mechanism is crucial for VANETs. Existing
trust-based detection mechanisms assign trust scores to RSUs based on their
interactions with moving vehicles where precise detection of rogue RSUs depends
on the accuracy of trust scores. However, brief interaction of RSUs with the
running vehicles permits inadequate time to estimate trust accurately. Besides,
current works use only vehicle speed and density in beacon messages to assess
trust without considering the sensor-detected data in the same messages.
Nonetheless, sensor data is useful for traffic management, and neglecting them
creates inaccuracy in trust estimation. In this paper, we address these
limitations and propose a trust-based scheme to detect malicious RSUs that uses
stable and frequent RSU-to-RSU (R2R) interaction to precisely analyze the
behavior of an RSU. We also offer a mechanism to detect alteration of
sensor-detected data in beacon content and incorporate this scheme in the trust
calculation of RSUs. The experimental results show that the proposed solution
effectively detects approximately 92% malicious RSUs, even in the presence of
hostile vehicles. Moreover, integrating the proposed solution with the VANET
routing protocols improves routing efficiency.

wide range of leading-edge separation intensities. Qualitative and quantitative
assessments are made using schlieren imaging, planar laser Rayleigh scattering,
and unsteady pressure measurements. A well-known to-and-fro shock motion called
pulsation and a flapping shock-shear layer oscillation is observed as $Re_D$
changes. A shorter protrusion length ($L/D=0.7$) produces a pressure loading
that is four orders higher than the cases with longer protrusion lengths. There
exists a critical separation length ($L/D \geq 1.4$) beyond which the separated
shear layer trips to turbulence and introduces fluctuations in the
recirculation region as $Re_D$ increases. The effect of the separated turbulent
shear layer is dampened by an order provided the reattachment angle is shallow
by increasing the fineness ratio ($d/D=0.4$). There also exists a critical
geometrical parameter ($L/D=1, d/D=0.2$) for which the unsteady modes switch
between successive runs based on the upstream fluctuations. From the modal
analysis of the Rayleigh scattering images, the first four dominant modes that
drive flapping are identified as translatory flapping, sinuous flapping, large

architecture, termed modular extremely large-scale array (XL-array), where an
extremely large number of antenna elements are regularly arranged on a common
platform in a modular manner. Each module consists of a flexible/moderate
number of antenna elements, and different modules are separated with an
inter-module spacing that is typically much larger than the inter-element
spacing/signal wavelength for ease of deployment. By properly modelling the
variations of signal phase, amplitude and projected aperture across different
array modules/elements, we develop the new channel model and analyze the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance of the modular XL-array based
communications. Under the practical non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) model,
the closed-form expression of the maximum achievable SNR is derived in terms of
key geometric parameters, including the total planar array size, module
separation distances along each dimension, as well as the user's location in
the three-dimensional (3D) space. Besides, the asymptotic SNR scaling laws are
revealed as the number of modules along different dimensions goes to infinity.
Moreover, we show that our developed near-field modelling and performance
analysis include the existing ones for the collocated XL-array, the far-field
uniform plane wave (UPW) model, as well as the one-dimensional (1D) modular
extremely large-scale uniform linear array (XL-ULA) as special cases. Extensive
simulation results are provided to validate our obtained results.

quite challenging due to its unique characteristics: the generated melodies
should not only follow good musical patterns, but also align with features in
lyrics such as rhythms and structures. These characteristics cannot be well
handled by neural generation models that learn lyric-to-melody mapping in an
end-to-end way, due to several issues: (1) lack of aligned lyric-melody
training data to sufficiently learn lyric-melody feature alignment; (2) lack of
controllability in generation to better and explicitly align the lyric-melody
features. In this paper, we propose Re-creation of Creations (ROC), a new
paradigm for lyric-to-melody generation. ROC generates melodies according to
given lyrics and also conditions on user-designated chord progression. It
addresses the above issues through a generation-retrieval pipeline.
Specifically, our paradigm has two stages: (1) creation stage, where a huge
amount of music fragments generated by a neural melody language model are
indexed in a database through several key features (e.g., chords, tonality,
rhythm, and structural information); (2) re-creation stage, where melodies are
re-created by retrieving music fragments from the database according to the key
features from lyrics and concatenating best music fragments based on
composition guidelines and melody language model scores. ROC has several
advantages: (1) It only needs unpaired melody data to train melody language
model, instead of paired lyric-melody data in previous models. (2) It achieves
good lyric-melody feature alignment in lyric-to-melody generation. Tested by
English and Chinese lyrics, ROC outperforms previous neural based
lyric-to-melody generation models on both objective and subjective metrics.

different building blocks in traditional communication systems. However, the
digital modulation still remains a challenge for neural networks. The intrinsic
mechanism of neural network based digital modulation is mapping continuous
output of the neural network encoder into discrete constellation symbols, which
is a non-differentiable function that cannot be trained with existing gradient
descend algorithms. To overcome this challenge, in this paper we develop a
joint coding-modulation scheme for digital semantic communications with BPSK
modulation. In our method, the neural network outputs the likelihood of each
constellation point, instead of having a concrete mapping. A random code rather
than a deterministic code is hence used, which preserves more information for
the symbols with a close likelihood on each constellation point. The joint
coding-modulation design can match the modulation process with channel states,
and hence improve the performance of digital semantic communications.
Experiment results show that our method outperforms existing digital modulation
methods in semantic communications over a wide range of SNR, and outperforms
neural network based analog modulation method in low SNR regime.

The

adjacent contours for each contour. There is a common point of adjacent
contours. This common point is called a node. The node is located between the
cells. In the deterministic version of the system, at any discrete moment, each
particles moves to the other cell of the contour if there is no delay. The
delays are due to that two particles may not pass through the common node
simultaneously. If two particles try to cross the same node, then a {\it
competition} occurs, and only one of these particles moves in accordance with a
prescribed competition resolution rule. In the stochastic version of the
system, each particle moves with the probability $1-\varepsilon,$ if the system

particle moves. where $\varepsilon$ is a small value. We have obtained a

Though with significant performance improvement, the globally shared parameter
may lead to local optimum. Besides, they are oblivious to the inherent

are critical in cold-start scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Task aligned
Meta-learning based Augmented Graph (TMAG) to address cold-start

proposed to cluster similar users and divide tasks for meta-learning, enabling
consistent optimization direction. Besides, an augmented graph neural network
with two graph enhanced approaches is designed to alleviate data sparsity and
capture the high-order user-item interactions. We validate our approach on
three real-world datasets in various cold-start scenarios, showing the
superiority of TMAG over state-of-the-art methods for cold-start

that there exist multiple recommendation domains where the scales of different

many MDS AG codes from elliptic curves defined over ${\bf F}_q$ for any given
small consecutive lengths $n$, which are not equivalent to Reed-Solomon codes
and twisted Reed-Solomon codes. 2) New self-dual MDS AG codes over ${\bf
F}_{{2^s}}$ from elliptic curves are constructed, which are not equivalent to
Reed-Solomon codes and twisted Reed-Solomon codes. 3) Twisted versions of some
elliptic curve codes are introduced such that new non-equivalent almost MDS

curve codes with the same length and the same dimension. The application to MDS
entanglement-assisted quantum codes is given.We also construct non-equivalent
new MDS codes of short lengths from higher genus curves.

contribute to element cycling and natural contaminant attenuation/mobilization,
even in well-oxygenated porous environments, such as shallow aquifers. This
paradox is commonly explained by the occurrence of small-scale anoxic
microenvironments generated by the coupling of bacterial respiration and the
heterogeneous oxygen (O2) transport by porewater. Such microenvironments allow
facultatively and obligately anaerobic bacteria to proliferate in oxic
environments. Microenvironment dynamics are still poorly understood due to the
challenge of directly observing biomass and O2 distributions at the microscale
within an opaque sediment and soil matrix. To overcome these limitations, we
integrated a microfluidic device with transparent O2 planar optical sensors to
measure the temporal behavior of dissolved O2 concentrations and biomass
distributions with time-lapse video-microscopy. Our results reveal that
bacterial colony morphology, which is highly variable in flowing porous
systems, controls the formation of anoxic microenvironments. We rationalize our
observations through a colony-scale Damkohler number comparing dissolved O2
diffusion and bacterial O2 uptake rate. Our Damkholer number enables predicting
the pore space occupied by anoxic microenvironments in our system, and, given
the bacterial organization, it can be applied to 3D porous systems.

formidable challenge where few observational results constrain models that
suffer from the non-physical influence of the grid resolution. We present
hydrodynamic global Implicit Large-Eddy simulations (ILES) of deep solar
convection performed with the EULAG-MHD code, and explore the effects of grid
resolution on the properties of rotating and non-rotating convection. The
results, based on low-order moments and turbulent spectra reveal that
convergence could be achieved in non-rotating simulations provided sufficient
resolution in the radial direction. The flow is highly anisotropic, with the
energy contained in horizontal divergent motions exceeding by more than three
orders of magnitude their radial counterpart. By contrast, in rotating
simulations the largest energy is in the toroidal part of the horizontal
motions. As the grid resolution increases, the turbulent correlations change in
such a way that a solar-like differential rotation, obtained in the simulation
with the coarser grid, transitions to the anti-solar differential rotation. The
reason for this change is the contribution of the effective viscosity to the
balance of the forces driving large-scale flows. As the effective viscosity
decreases, the angular momentum balance improves, yet the force balance in the
meridional direction lessens, favoring a strong meridional flow that advects
angular momentum towards the poles. The results suggest that obtaining the
correct distribution of angular momentum may not be a mere issue of numerical
resolution. Accounting for additional physics, such as magnetism or the
near-surface shear layer, may be necessary in simulating the solar interior.

cutting plane methods for neural network verification while benefiting from the

high-quality cutting planes for strengthening bound-propagation-based verifiers

quickly explore a large number of branches with strong cutting planes, leading
to strong verification performance. Experiments demonstrate that our method is

parameter, type A uncertainty (UA), into model performance evaluations. We
particularly focus on the relations between sample sizes and three evaluation
parameters, and tested a few ocean color remote sensing algorithms and

size n but present different trends. Based on our tested results and
theoretical analysis, we therefore conclude that UA is better than RMSE and MAE
to express model uncertainty, because its downward trends indicate that the
more samples we take, the less uncertainty we get. RMSE and MAE are good
parameters for assessing model accuracy rather than uncertainty.

its wide use as a fundamental component in modern SSL frameworks, the benefit
caused by momentum is not well understood. We find that its success can be at
least partly attributed to the stability effect. In the first attempt, we
analyze how EMA affects each part of the encoder and reveal that the portion
near the encoder's input plays an insignificant role while the latter parts
have much more influence. By monitoring the gradient of the overall loss with
respect to the output of each block in the encoder, we observe that the final
layers tend to fluctuate much more than other layers during backpropagation,
i.e. less stability. Interestingly, we show that using EMA to the final part of
the SSL encoder, i.e. projector, instead of the whole deep network encoder can
give comparable or preferable performance. Our proposed projector-only momentum
helps maintain the benefit of EMA but avoids the double forward computation.

  Retrieval","Preprint",,,,"cs.IR cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent advance in Dense Retrieval (DR) techniques has significantly improved
the effectiveness of first-stage retrieval. Trained with large-scale supervised
data, DR models can encode queries and documents into a low-dimensional dense
space and conduct effective semantic matching. However, previous studies have
shown that the effectiveness of DR models would drop by a large margin when the
trained DR models are adopted in a target domain that is different from the
domain of the labeled data. One of the possible reasons is that the DR model
has never seen the target corpus and thus might be incapable of mitigating the
difference between the training and target domains. In practice, unfortunately,
training a DR model for each target domain to avoid domain shift is often a
difficult task as it requires additional time, storage, and domain-specific
data labeling, which are not always available. To address this problem, in this
paper, we propose a novel DR framework named Disentangled Dense Retrieval (DDR)
to support effective and flexible domain adaptation for DR models. DDR consists
of a Relevance Estimation Module (REM) for modeling domain-invariant matching
patterns and several Domain Adaption Modules (DAMs) for modeling
domain-specific features of multiple target corpora. By making the REM and DAMs
disentangled, DDR enables a flexible training paradigm in which REM is trained
with supervision once and DAMs are trained with unsupervised data.
Comprehensive experiments in different domains and languages show that DDR
significantly improves ranking performance compared to strong DR baselines and
substantially outperforms traditional retrieval methods in most scenarios.

The model could successfully reconstruct the flow fields with accurate flow

where a wide variety of complex organic molecules are observed. Dust particles
play an essential role in the formation of these complex organic molecules.
During the warm-up stage of a star-forming region, the molecules formed during

the outer part of the proto-planetary disk during the further evolved stage

The binding energies of these molecules with the prevailing dust particles play
a crucial role in determining the structural information of this disk. Thus the

promising QEC methods. Decoding SCs is the most computational expensive task in
the control device of quantum computers (QCs), and many works focus on accurate
decoding algorithms for SCs, including ones with neural networks (NNs).
Practical QCs also require low-latency decoding because slow decoding leads to
the accumulation of errors on qubits, resulting in logical failures. For QCs
with superconducting qubits, a practical decoder must be very power-efficient
in addition to having high accuracy and low latency. In order to reduce the

  In this paper, we propose an NN-based accurate, fast, and low-power decoder

behaviors of a nonmagnetic metal/nonmagnetic metal/ferromagnetic insulator
(NM/NM/FI) heterostructure in the presence of Anderson disorders. For the
two-dimensional (2D) NM/NM/FI system, an enhancement of spin conductance in the
weak disorder regime is found due to the increasing of the interfacial density
of states (DOS) at NM/FI interface. As a result, a new scaling regime is
uncovered in the metallic regime where the spin conductance fluctuation rms(G)
scales linearly with the average spin conductance <G>, independent of system
parameters such as Fermi energies and temperatures. The competition between the
disorder-enhanced interfacial DOS and disorder-suppressed spin transport
results in a non-monotonic dependence of average spin conductance on disorder
strength. In the localized regime, the variance of lnG for different system
parameters follows a universal function that depends linearly on the average of
logarithm of spin conductance <lnG>.The distribution of lnG in the localized
regime is non-Gaussian whose deviation from Gaussian can be characterized by
the third and fourth order cumulants of lnG, denoted as k3 and k4,
respectively. We find that k3~<-lnG>^3/2 and k4~<lnG>^2. This suggests that the
spin conductance mediated by magnon in NM/NM/FI hybrid systems belongs to a
different universality class. For fixed <lnG>, the lnG distribution in the
localized regime for different system parameters is found to collapse onto a
single curve, suggesting the distribution P(lnG;<lnG>) is a universal function
that depends only on <lnG>. Furthermore, spin thermopower S in the presence of
disorder is studied and the variance of lnS is found to scale linearly with
<lnS> for different system parameters in the localized regime. Spin conductance
and spin thermopower for 1D NM/NM/FI are also studied.

cliques is too stiff to applicate to real cases, the k-plex relaxes the notion

k-plexes are more flexible than cliques, finding them is more challenging as
their number is greater. In this paper, we aim to detect the k-plex under the

bounding strategy. We introduce the constraint learning concept to learn the
bound strategy from the branch and bound process and develop it into a Mixed
Integer Programming framework. While most of the work is dedicated on learn the
branch strategy in branch and bound-based algorithms, we focus on the learn to
bound strategy which needs to handle the problem that learned strategy might
not examine the feasible solution. We adopted the MILP framework and design a
set of variables relative to the k-plex property as our constraint space to
learn the strategy. The learn to bound strategy learning the original strategy
function also reduces the computation load of the bound process to accelerate
the branch and bound algorithm. Note that the learn to bound concept can apply
to any branch and bound based algorithm with the appropriate framework. We
conduct the experiment on different networks, the results show that our learn

efficiency in offline reinforcement learning (RL), which aims to learn to
perform decision making from history data without active exploration. Due to
uncertainties and variabilities of the environment, it is critical to learn a
robust policy -- with as few samples as possible -- that performs well even
when the deployed environment deviates from the nominal one used to collect the
history dataset. We consider a distributionally robust formulation of offline
RL, focusing on tabular robust Markov decision processes with an uncertainty
set specified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence in both finite-horizon and
infinite-horizon settings. To combat with sample scarcity, a model-based
algorithm that combines distributionally robust value iteration with the
principle of pessimism in the face of uncertainty is proposed, by penalizing
the robust value estimates with a carefully designed data-driven penalty term.
Under a mild and tailored assumption of the history dataset that measures
distribution shift without requiring full coverage of the state-action space,
we establish the finite-sample complexity of the proposed algorithm, and
further show it is almost unimprovable in light of a nearly-matching
information-theoretic lower bound up to a polynomial factor of the (effective)
horizon length. To the best our knowledge, this provides the first provably
near-optimal robust offline RL algorithm that learns under model uncertainty

That seminal work was restricted to show that empirical measures of Total
Correlation lead to connectivity patterns that differ from what is obtained
using linear correlation and Mutual Information. However, beyond the obvious
multivariate versus bivariate definitions, no theoretical insight on the
benefits of Total Correlation was given. The accuracy of the empirical
estimators could not be addressed because no controlled scenario with known
analytical result was considered either.
  In this work we analytically illustrate the advantages of Total Correlation
to describe the functional connectivity in the visual pathway. Our neural model
includes three layers (retina, LGN, and V1 cortex) and one can control the
connectivity among the nodes, within the cortex, and the eventual top-down
feedback. In this multivariate setting (three nodes with multidimensional
signals), we derive analytical results for the three-way Total Correlation and
for all possible pairwise Mutual Information measures. These analytical results
show that pairwise Mutual Information cannot capture the effect of different
intra-cortical inhibitory connections while the three-way Total Correlation
can. The presented analytical setting is also useful to check empirical
estimators of Total Correlation. Therefore, once certain estimator can be
trusted, one can explore the behavior with natural signals where the analytical
results (that assume Gaussian signals) are no longer valid. In this regard (a)
we explore the effect of connectivity and feedback in the analytical
retina-cortex network with natural images, and (b) we assess the functional

approach for scalable and efficient pose-based action recognition. At the
representation level, we propose a global frame based part stream approach as
opposed to conventional modality based streams. Within each part stream, the
associated data from multiple modalities is unified and consumed by the
processing pipeline. Experimentally, PSUMNet achieves state of the art
performance on the widely used NTURGB+D 60/120 dataset and dense joint skeleton
dataset NTU 60-X/120-X. PSUMNet is highly efficient and outperforms competing
methods which use 100%-400% more parameters. PSUMNet also generalizes to the
SHREC hand gesture dataset with competitive performance. Overall, PSUMNet's
scalability, performance and efficiency makes it an attractive choice for
action recognition and for deployment on compute-restricted embedded and edge
devices. Code and pretrained models can be accessed at

test the individual components of Dbias to see how effective they are. The
experimental results show that Dbias outperforms all the baselines in terms of

achieve outstanding success in dealing with attacks from known morphing

the insufficient diversity and quantity of the existing MAD datasets. To
address this concern, we propose a completely unsupervised MAD solution via
self-paced anomaly detection (SPL-MAD) by leveraging the existing large-scale

autoencoders. Using general FR datasets that might contain unintentionally and
unlabeled manipulated samples to train an autoencoder can lead to a diverse

behavior empirically to provide a solid theoretical ground for designing our
unsupervised MAD solution. This also results in proposing to integrate our
adapted modified self-paced learning paradigm to enhance the reconstruction
error separability between the bona fide and attack samples in a completely

(R < 2 Rearth) and rocky or they are gas giants with radii of >1 Rjup. Here, we
report on the intermediate-sized planet TOI-2196 on a 1.2 day orbit around a
G-type star discovered by TESS in sector 27. We collected 42 radial velocity
measurements with the HARPS spectrograph to determine the mass. The radius of
TOI-2196 b is 3.51 +/- 0.15 Rearth, which, combined with the mass of 26.0 +/-
1.3 Mearth, results in a bulk density of 3.31+0.51-0.43 g/cm3. Hence, the
radius implies that this planet is a sub-Neptune, although the density is twice
than that of Neptune. A significant trend in the HARPS radial velocities points
to the presence of a distant companion with a lower limit on the period and
mass of 220 days and 0.65 Mjup, respectively, assuming zero eccentricity. The
short period of planet b implies a high equilibrium temperature of 1860 +/- 20
K, for zero albedo and isotropic emission. This places the planet in the hot
Neptune desert, joining a group of very few planets in this parameter space
discovered in recent years. These planets suggest that the hot Neptune desert
may be divided in two parts for planets with equilibrium temperatures of > 1800
K: a hot sub-Neptune desert devoid of planets with radii of 1.8-3 Rearth and a
sub-Jovian desert for radii of 5-12 Rearth. More planets in this parameter
space are needed to further investigate this finding. Planetary interior
structure models of TOI-2196 b are consistent with a H/He atmosphere mass
fraction between 0.4 % and 3 %, with a mean value of 0.7 % on top of a rocky
interior. We estimated the amount of mass this planet might have lost at a
young age, and we find that while the mass loss could have been significant,
the planet had not changed in terms of character: it was born as a small
volatile-rich planet, and it remains one at present.

Our objective was to propose an innovative alternative solution to predict an

developed DynForest, an extension of competing-risk random survival forests
that handles endogenous longitudinal predictors. At each node of the tree, the
time-dependent predictors are translated into time-fixed features (using mixed
models) to be used as candidates for splitting the subjects into two subgroups.
The individual event probability is estimated in each tree by the
Aalen-Johansen estimator of the leaf in which the subject is classified
according to his/her history of predictors. The final individual prediction is
given by the average of the tree-specific individual event probabilities. We
carried out a simulation study to demonstrate the performances of DynForest
both in a small dimensional context (in comparison with joint models) and in a
large dimensional context (in comparison with a regression calibration method
that ignores informative dropout). We also applied DynForest to (i) predict the
individual probability of dementia in the elderly according to repeated

(ii) quantify the importance of each type of markers for the prediction of

  nanoparticles for active targeting of tumor cells",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Strategies based on the active targeting of tumor cells are emerging as smart
and efficient nanomedical procedures. Folic acid (FA) is a vitamin and a
well-established tumor targeting agent because of its strong affinity for the
folate receptor (FR), which is an overexpressed protein on the cell membranes
of the tumor cells. FA can be successfully anchored to several nanocarriers,
including inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) based on transition metal oxides. Among
them, TiO$_{2}$ is extremely interesting because of its excellent
photoabsorption and photocatalytic properties, which can be exploited in
photodynamic therapy. However, it is not yet clear in which respects direct
anchoring of FA to the NP or the use of spacers, based on polyethylene glycol
(PEG) chains, are different and whether one approach is better than the other.
In this work, we combine Quantum Mechanics (QM) and Classical Molecular
Dynamics (MD) to design and optimize the FA functionalization on bare and
PEGylated TiO$_{2}$ models and to study the dynamical behavior of the resulting
nanoconjugates in pure water environment and in physiological conditions. We
observe that they are chemically stable, even under the effect of increasing
temperature (up to 500 K). Using the results from long MD simulations (100 ns)
and from free energy calculations, we determine how the density of FA molecules
on the TiO$_{2}$ NP and the presence of PEG spacers impact on the actual
exposure of the ligands, especially by affecting the extent of FA-FA
intermolecular interactions, which are detrimental for the targeting ability of
FA towards the folate receptor. This analysis provides a solid and rational
basis for experimentalists to define the optimal FA density and the more
appropriate mode of anchoring to the carrier, according to the final purpose of
the nanoconjugate.

by an orbital period of ~1 hour and a projected semi-major axis of 14 lt-ms.
The neutron star binary mass function suggests a minimum donor mass of 1.7e-2

and is vital for metrological quantum voltage standards. The physically dual
effect, the AC coherent quantum phase slip (CQPS), photon assisted tunnelling
of magnetic fluxes through a superconducting nanowire, is envisaged to reveal
itself as quantised current steps. The basic physical significance of the AC
CQPS is also complemented by practical importance in future current standards;

was demonstrated as superposition of magnetic flux quanta in superconducting

unavailable basic effect of superconductivity to date, was unattainable due to
lack of appropriate materials and challenges in circuit engineering. Here we
report the direct observation of the dual Shapiro steps in a superconducting
nanowire. The sharp steps are clear up to 26 GHz frequency with current values
8.3 nA and limited by the present setup bandwidth. The current steps have been
theoretically predicted in small Josephson junctions (JJs) 30 years ago.
However, broadening unavoidable in JJs prevents their direct experimental
observation. We solve this problem by placing a thin NbN nanowire in an
inductive environment.

$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ connected through a domain (node) of diameter
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon).$ Inhomogeneous Neumann type boundary conditions,
that involve convective and diffusive fluxes, are prescribed both on the
lateral surfaces of the thin cylinders and the boundary of the node.
  The asymptotic behaviour of the solution is studied as $\varepsilon \to 0,$
i.e., when the diffusion coefficients are eliminated and the thin junction is
shrunk into a three-part graph connected in a single vertex. A rigorous
procedure for the construction of the complete asymptotic expansion of the
solution is developed and the corresponding energetic and uniform pointwise
estimates are proven. Depending on the directions of the limit convective
fluxes, the corresponding limit problems $(\varepsilon = 0)$ are derived in the
form of first-order hyperbolic differential equations on the one-dimensional
branches with novel gluing conditions at the vertex. These generalize the
classical Kirchhoff transmission conditions and might require the solution of a
three-dimensional cell-like problem associated with the vertex to account for
the local geometric inhomogeneity of the node and the physical processes in the
node. The asymptotic ansatz consists of three parts, namely, the regular part,
node-layer part, and boundary-layer one. Their coefficients are classical
solutions to mixed-dimensional limit problems. The existence and other
properties of those solutions are analyzed.

the sleep stage using infrared videos by distilling useful knowledge from EEG
signals to the visual ones. To establish a solid cross-modal benchmark for this
application, we develop a new dataset termed as Seeing your Sleep Stage via
Infrared Video and EEG ($S^3VE$). $S^3VE$ is a large-scale dataset including
synchronized infrared video and EEG signal for sleep stage classification,
including 105 subjects and 154,573 video clips that is more than 1100 hours

The SACD achieved the state-of-the-art performances on both our $S^3VE$ and the

spaces. First, the code of a definable $n$-type (in the field sort) can be
taken to be a real tuple (in the field sort) rather than an imaginary tuple (in
the geometric sorts). Second, any definable type in the real or imaginary sorts
is generated by a countable union of chains parameterized by the value group.
Third, if $X$ is an interpretable set, then the space of global definable types
on $X$ is strictly pro-interpretable, building off work of Cubides Kovacsics,
Hils, and Ye. Fourth, global definable types can be lifted (in a non-canonical
way) along interpretable surjections. Fifth, if $G$ is a definable group with
definable f-generics ($dfg$), and $G$ acts on a definable set $X$, then the
quotient space $X/G$ is definable, not just interpretable. This explains some
phenomena observed by Pillay and Yao. Lastly, we show that interpretable
topological spaces satisfy analogues of first-countability and curve selection.
Using this, we show that all reasonable notions of definable compactness agree
on interpretable topological spaces, and that definable compactness is
definable in families.

regions in the video to a descriptive natural language query. This is a
challenging vision-language task that necessitates constructing the correct
cross-modal correspondence and modeling the appropriate spatio-temporal context
of the query video and caption, thereby localizing the specific objects
accurately. In this paper, we tackle this task by a novel framework called
HiErarchical spatio-tempoRal reasOning (HERO) with contrastive action
correspondence. We study the VOG task at two aspects that prior works
overlooked: (1) Contrastive Action Correspondence-aware Retrieval. Notice that
the fine-grained video semantics (e.g., multiple actions) is not totally
aligned with the annotated language query (e.g., single action), we first
introduce the weakly-supervised contrastive learning that classifies the video
as action-consistent and action-independent frames relying on the video-caption
action semantic correspondence. Such a design can build the fine-grained
cross-modal correspondence for more accurate subsequent VOG. (2) Hierarchical
Spatio-temporal Modeling Improvement. While transformer-based VOG models
present their potential in sequential modality (i.e., video and caption)
modeling, existing evidence also indicates that the transformer suffers from
the issue of the insensitive spatio-temporal locality. Motivated by that, we
carefully design the hierarchical reasoning layers to decouple fully connected
multi-head attention and remove the redundant interfering correlations.
Furthermore, our proposed pyramid and shifted alignment mechanisms are
effective to improve the cross-modal information utilization of neighborhood
spatial regions and temporal frames. We conducted extensive experiments to show
our HERO outperforms existing techniques by achieving significant improvement
on two benchmark datasets.

tabular data to avoid additional cognitive load caused by splitting users'
attention. However, most of the existing studies focus on simple flat tables
instead of hierarchical tables, whose complex structure limits the
expressiveness of visualization results and affects users' efficiency in
visualization construction. We present HiTailor, a technique for presenting and
exploring hierarchical tables. HiTailor constructs an abstract model, which
defines row/column headings as biclustering and hierarchical structures. Based
on our abstract model, we identify three pairs of operators, Swap/Transpose,
ToStacked/ToLinear, Fold/Unfold, for transformations of hierarchical tables to
support users' comprehensive explorations. After transformation, users can
specify a cell or block of interest in hierarchical tables as a TableUnit for
visualization, and HiTailor recommends other related TableUnits according to
the abstract model using different mechanisms. We demonstrate the usability of
the HiTailor system through a comparative study and a case study with domain
experts, showing that HiTailor can present and explore hierarchical tables from
different viewpoints. HiTailor is available at

interstellar detection of propionamide (C2H5CONH2) was reported toward Sgr
B2(N) with ALMA observations at millimeter wavelengths. Yet, this detection has
been questioned by others from the same set of ALMA observations as no
statistically significant line emission was identified from any uncontaminated
transitions. Using the PRrbiotic Interstellar MOlecule Survey (PRIMOS)
observations, we report an additional search for C2H5CONH2 at centimeter

C2H5CONH2 were detected. An upper limit for C2H5CONH2 at centimeter wavelengths
was determined to be less than 1.8e14 cm-2 and an upper limit to the
C2H5CONH2/CH3CONH2 ratio is found to be less than 2.34. This work again
questions the initial detection of C2H5CONH2 and indicates that more complex

substantially lower than corresponding ones from DMFT and non-self-consistent

factorized and controlled by splitting kernels with a process-independent
structure. We use these kernels to define collinear functions that can be used
in QCD resummation formulae of hard-scattering observables. Different collinear
functions are obtained by integrating the splitting kernels over different
phase-space regions that depend on the hard-scattering observables of interest.
The collinear functions depend on an auxiliary vector $n^\mu$ that can be
either light-like $(n^2=0)$ or time-like $(n^2 > 0)$. In the case of
transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) collinear functions, we show that the use
of a time-like auxiliary vector avoids the rapidity divergences, which are
instead present if $n^2=0$. The perturbative computation of the collinear
functions lead to infrared (IR) divergences that can be properly factorized
with respect to IR finite functions that embody the logarithmically-enhanced
collinear contributions to hard-scattering cross sections. We evaluate various
collinear functions and their $n^\mu$ dependence at ${\cal O}(\alpha_{\rm S})$.
We compute the azimuthal-correlation component of the TMD collinear functions
at ${\cal O}(\alpha_{\rm S}^2)$, and we present the results of the ${\cal
O}(\alpha_{\rm S}^2)$ contribution of linearly-polarized gluons to
transverse-momentum resummation formulae. Beyond ${\cal O}(\alpha_{\rm S}^2)$
the collinear functions of initial-state colliding partons are process

propose a method to realize non-reciprocal optical transmission in an array of
coupled resonators. The optical non-reciprocity of the coupled resonators
arises from the frequency gradient between adjacent cavities and the
interaction with the environment, which is similar to photosynthetic energy
transfer. An increase in the frequency gradient or the number of the cavities
can lead to better non-reciprocity. However, although a higher environment
temperature will increase the total photon number in the coupled cavities,
non-reciprocity will be weakened. All these findings can be well described by
the detailed balance. Our discovery reveals the similarity between the
noise-induced optical non-reciprocity and exciton energy transfer in natural
photosynthesis.

In the framework of density-functional theory, we investigate stability and
electronic properties of surface slabs of CsK$_2$Sb, an emerging semiconducting
photocathode material for particle accelerators. Considering surfaces with
Miller indices 0 and 1, and accounting for all possible terminations, we find
that, at the interface with vacuum, the atomic layers may rearrange
considerably to minimize the electrostatic repulsion between neighboring alkali
species. From the analysis of the surface energy as a function of the chemical
potential, we find a striking preference for surfaces oriented along the (111)
direction. Yet, at large and intermediate concentrations of Cs and K,
respectively, (100) and (110) slabs are energetically most favorable. The
considered surfaces exhibit either semiconducting or metallic character. Of the
former kind is the most stable (111) slab which has a band gap of about 1.3 eV,
in excellent agreement with experimental values for CsK$_2$Sb samples. Metallic
surfaces have lower work function, on the order of 2.5 eV, in line with the
emission threshold measured for CsK$_2$Sb photocathodes. All in all these
results contribute to the fundamental understanding of the microscopic

generalisability, fairness, and security issues. We hope that the findings of
this study and the annotation databases will help to evaluate and mitigate bias

$\kappa$-Poincar\'e deformation the three types of noncommutative spaces of
geodesics can be constructed, while for the time-like and space-like
deformations both the quantum time-like and space-like geodesics can be
defined, but not the light-like one. This obstruction comes from the constraint
imposed by the coisotropy condition for the corresponding deformation with
respect to the isotropy subalgebra associated to the given space of geodesics,
since all these quantum spaces are constructed as quantizations of the
corresponding classical coisotropic Poisson homogeneous spaces. The known
quantum space of geodesics on the light cone is given by a five-dimensional
homogeneous quadratic algebra, and the six nocommutative spaces of time-like
and space-like geodesics are explicitly obtained as six-dimensional nonlinear
algebras. Five out of these six spaces are here presented for the first time,
and Darboux generators for all of them are found, thus showing that the quantum
deformation parameter $\kappa^{-1}$ plays exactly the same algebraic role on
quantum geodesics as the Planck constant $\hbar$ plays in the usual phase space

generalize on the unseen target domain. Although it has achieved great success,
most of existing methods require the label information for all training samples
in source domains, which is time-consuming and expensive in the real-world
application. In this paper, we resort to solving the semi-supervised domain
generalization (SSDG) task, where there are a few label information in each
source domain. To address the task, we first analyze the theory of the
multi-domain learning, which highlights that 1) mitigating the impact of domain
gap and 2) exploiting all samples to train the model can effectively reduce the
generalization error in each source domain so as to improve the quality of
pseudo-labels. According to the analysis, we propose MultiMatch, i.e.,
extending FixMatch to the multi-task learning framework, producing the
high-quality pseudo-label for SSDG. To be specific, we consider each training
domain as a single task (i.e., local task) and combine all training domains
together (i.e., global task) to train an extra task for the unseen test domain.
In the multi-task framework, we utilize the independent BN and classifier for
each task, which can effectively alleviate the interference from different
domains during pseudo-labeling. Also, most of parameters in the framework are
shared, which can be trained by all training samples sufficiently. Moreover, to
further boost the pseudo-label accuracy and the model's generalization, we fuse
the predictions from the global task and local task during training and
testing, respectively. A series of experiments validate the effectiveness of
the proposed method, and it outperforms the existing semi-supervised methods

(exclusion criterion), and is not confounded with the outcome (exogeneity).
These assumptions are generally untestable and rely on subject-matter

of assumptions violation on the estimated parameters. In this paper, we propose
and demonstrate a new method of sensitivity analysis for G-estimators in causal

analysis in instrumental variables studies. The first is a single sensitivity
parameter that captures violations of exclusion and exogeneity assumptions. The

scales above the inflaton mass, such as the Planck scale or the grand
unification scale. In such a scenario, the dark matter is mainly produced out
of equilibrium during the period of reheating, often referred to as UV
freeze-in. We evaluate the abundance of the dark matter generated from
bremsstrahlung off the inflaton decay products assuming no direct coupling
between the inflaton and the dark matter. This process generally dominates the
production of dark matter for low reheating temperatures where the production
through the annihilations of particle in the thermal plasma becomes
inefficient. We find that the bremsstrahlung process dominates for reheating
temperatures $T_{\mathrm{RH}} \lesssim 10^{10}$ GeV, and produces the requisite
density of dark matter for a UV scale $\simeq 10^{16}$ GeV. As examples, we
calculate numerically the yield of the dark matter bremsstrahlung through
gravitation and dimension-6 vector portal effective interactions.

badges in a non-game context to encourage a desired behavior from individuals

software engineering contexts as a means to promote certain activities to
practitioners. Previous studies investigated the use of gamification to promote

either performed in an educational environment or in small to medium-sized
teams of developers in the industry.
  We performed a large-scale mixed-methods study on the effects of badge-based
gamification in promoting the adoption of DevOps practices in a very large
company and evaluated how practice adoption is associated with changes in key
delivery, quality, and throughput metrics of 333 software projects. We observed
an accelerated adoption of some gamified DevOps practices by at least 60%, with
increased adoption rates up to 6x. We found mixed results when associating
badge adoption and metric changes: teams that earned testing badges showed an
increase in bug fixing commits but output fewer commits and pull requests;
teams that earned code review and quality tooling badges exhibited faster
delivery metrics. Finally, our empirical study was supplemented by a survey
with 45 developers where 73% of respondents found badges to be helpful for
learning about and adopting new standardized practices. Our results contribute
to the rich knowledge on gamification with a unique and important perspective
from real industry practitioners.

attention in recent years. A morphed image can be successfully verified to
multiple identities. This operation, therefore, poses serious security issues
related to the ability of a travel or identity document to be verified to
belong to multiple persons. Previous works touched on the issue of the quality
of morphing attack images, however, with the main goal of quantitatively
proofing the realistic appearance of the produced morphing attacks. We theorize
that the morphing processes might have an effect on both, the perceptual image
quality and the image utility in face recognition (FR) when compared to bona
fide samples. Towards investigating this theory, this work provides an
extensive analysis of the effect of morphing on face image quality, including
both general image quality measures and face image utility measures. This
analysis is not limited to a single morphing technique, but rather looks at six
different morphing techniques and five different data sources using ten
different quality measures. This analysis reveals consistent separability
between the quality scores of morphing attack and bona fide samples measured by
certain quality measures. Our study goes further to build on this effect and
investigate the possibility of performing unsupervised morphing attack
detection (MAD) based on quality scores. Our study looks intointra and
inter-dataset detectability to evaluate the generalizability of such a
detection concept on different morphing techniques and bona fide sources. Our
final results point out that a set of quality measures, such as MagFace and
CNNNIQA, can be used to perform unsupervised and generalized MAD with a correct

unreliable. The current IoT platforms lack techniques for transparent and
tamper-proof ordering of events due to their device-centric logging mechanism.
In this paper, we develop a framework that facilitates tamper-proof
transparency and event order in an IoT platform by proposing a Blockchain
protocol and adopting the vector clock system, both tailored for the
resource-constrained heterogeneous IoT devices, respectively. To cope with the
unsuited storage (e.g., ledger) and computing power (e.g., proof of work
puzzle) requirements of the Blockchain in the commercial off-the-shelf IoT
devices, we propose a partial consistent cut protocol and engineer a modular
arithmetic-based lightweight proof of work puzzle, respectively. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first Blockchain designed for resource-constrained
heterogeneous IoT platforms. Our event ordering protocol based on the vector
clock system is also novel for the IoT platforms. We implement our framework
using an IoT gateway and 30 IoT devices. We experiment with 10 concurrent
trigger-action-based event chains while each chain involves 20 devices, and
each device participates in 5 different chains. The results show that our
framework may order these events in 2.5 seconds while consuming only 140 mJ of
energy per device. The results hence demonstrate the proposed platform as a
practical choice for many IoT applications such as smart home, traffic

during clinical routine), 3. The algorithm can only segment one anatomical

increases the effort required to set up the system. In this work we publish a
new dataset and segmentation toolkit which solves all three of these problems:
In 1204 CT images we segmented 104 anatomical structures (27 organs, 59 bones,
10 muscles, 8 vessels) covering a majority of relevant classes for most use
cases. We show an improved workflow for the creation of ground truth
segmentations which speeds up the process by over 10x. The CT images were

segmentation algorithm on this new dataset. We call this algorithm
TotalSegmentator and make it easily available as a pretrained python pip
package (pip install totalsegmentator). Usage is as simple as TotalSegmentator

theory of factorization can be greatly generalized by combining the languages

certain factorizations, herein called $\preceq$-factorizations, for the
$\preceq$-non-units of a (multiplicatively written) monoid $H$ endowed with a
preorder $\preceq$, where an element $u \in H$ is a $\preceq$-unit if $u
\preceq 1_H \preceq u$ and a $\preceq$-non-unit otherwise. The ``building
blocks'' of these factorizations are the $\preceq$-irreducibles of $H$ (i.e.,
the $\preceq$-non-units $a \in H$ that cannot be written as a product of two
$\preceq$-non-units each of which is strictly $\preceq$-smaller than $a$); and
it is interesting to look for sufficient conditions for the
$\preceq$-factorizations of a $\preceq$-non-unit to be bounded in length or
finite in number (if measured or counted in a suitable way). This is precisely
the kind of questions addressed in the present work, whose main novelty is the
study of the interaction between minimal $\preceq$-factorizations (i.e., a
refinement of $\preceq$-factorizations used to counter the ``blow-up
phenomena'' that are inherent to factorization in non-commutative or
non-cancellative monoids) and some finiteness conditions describing the ``local
behaviour'' of the pair $(H, \preceq)$. Besides a number of examples and
remarks, the paper includes many arithmetic results, a part of which are new
already in the basic case where $\preceq$ is the divisibility preorder on $H$
(and hence in the setup of the classical theory).

and communication (IRSC) systems, where the radar can covertly communicate with
legitimate users under the cover of the probing waveforms without being
detected by the eavesdropper. Specifically, by jointly designing the target
detection beamformer and communication beamformer, we aim to maximize the radar
detection mutual information (MI) (or the communication rate) subject to the
covert constraint, the communication rate constraint (or the radar detection MI
constraint), and the total power constraint. For the perfect eavesdropper's
channel state information (CSI) scenario, we transform the covert beamforming
design problems into a series of convex subproblems, by exploiting semidefinite
relaxation, which can be solved via the bisection search method. Considering
the high complexity of iterative optimization, we further propose a
single-iterative covert beamformer design scheme based on the zero-forcing
criterion. For the imperfect eavesdropper's CSI scenario, we develop a
relaxation and restriction method to tackle the robust covert beamforming
design problems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed covert beamforming schemes for perfect and imperfect CSI scenarios.

hardware, which directly affects both area efficiency and energy efficiency.
Being an enabling technique, the wide applications of multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) heavily relies on efficient implementations balancing
both performance and complexity. However, most of the existing detectors
uniformly quantize all variables, resulting in high redundancy and low
flexibility. Requiring both expertise and efforts, an in-depth tailored
quantization usually asks for prohibitive costs and is not considered by
conventional MIMO detectors. In this paper, a general framework named the
automatic hybrid-precision quantization (AHPQ) is proposed with two parts:
integral quantization determined by probability density function (PDF), and
fractional quantization by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Being automatic,
AHPQ demonstrates high efficiency in figuring out good quantizations for a set
of algorithmic parameters. For the approximate message passing (AMP) detector,
AHPQ achieves up to $58.7\%$ lower average bitwidth than the unified
quantization (UQ) one with almost no performance sacrifice. The feasibility of
AHPQ has been verified by implementation with $65$ nm CMOS technology. Compared
with its UQ counterpart, AHPQ exhibits $2.97\times$ higher throughput-to-area
ratio (TAR) with $19.3\%$ lower energy dissipation. Moreover, by node
compression and strength reduction, the AHPQ detector outperforms the
state-of-the-art (SOA) in both throughput ($17.92$ Gb/s) and energy efficiency
($7.93$ pJ/b). The proposed AHPQ framework is also applicable for other digital

stellar population modelling, where the distribution of stellar ages and
metallicities in a galaxy is inferred from observations. In this context, blobs
may correspond to stars born in-situ versus those accreted from satellites, and
the task of blob detection is to disentangle these components. A difficulty
arises when the distributions come with significant uncertainties, as is the
case for stellar population recoveries inferred from modelling spectra of
unresolved stellar systems. There is currently no satisfactory method for blob
detection with uncertainties. Aims. We introduce a method for uncertainty-aware
blob detection developed in the context of stellar population modelling of
integrated-light spectra of stellar systems. Methods. We develop theory and
computational tools for an uncertainty-aware version of the classic
Laplacian-of-Gaussians method for blob detection, which we call ULoG. This
identifies significant blobs considering a variety of scales. As a prerequisite
to apply ULoG to stellar population modelling, we introduce a method for
efficient computation of uncertainties for spectral modelling. This method is
based on the truncated Singular Value Decomposition and Markov Chain Monte
Carlo sampling (SVD-MCMC). Results. We apply the methods to data of the star
cluster M54. We show that the SVD-MCMC inferences match those from standard
MCMC, but are a factor 5-10 faster to compute. We apply ULoG to the inferred
M54 age/metallicity distributions, identifying between 2 or 3 significant,
distinct populations amongst its stars.

complex systems. Sensitivity analysis is an important practice to aid our
understanding of the mechanics of these models and the processes they describe,
but performing a sufficient number of model evaluations to obtain accurate
sensitivity estimates can often be prohibitively expensive. In order to reduce
the computational burden, a common solution is to use a surrogate model that
approximates the original model reasonably well but at a fraction of the cost.
However, in exchange for the computational benefits of surrogate-based
sensitivity analysis, this approach comes with the price of a loss in accuracy
arising from the difference between the surrogate and the original model. To
address this issue, we adapt the floodgate method of Zhang and Janson (2020) to
provide valid surrogate-based confidence intervals rather than a point
estimate, allowing for the benefit of the computational speed-up of using a
surrogate that is especially pronounced for high-dimensional models, while
still retaining rigorous and accurate bounds on the global sensitivity with
respect to the original (non-surrogate) model. Our confidence interval is
asymptotically valid with almost no conditions on the computational model or
the surrogate. Additionally, the accuracy (width) of our confidence interval
shrinks as the surrogate's accuracy increases, so when an accurate surrogate is
used, the confidence interval we report will correspondingly be quite narrow,
instilling appropriately high confidence in its estimate. We demonstrate the
properties of our method through numerical simulations on the small Hymod
hydrological model, and also apply it to the more complex CBM-Z meteorological
model with a recent neural-network-based surrogate.

quasi-shuffle Hopf algebra to a non-abelian version describing BCJ numerators
with all possible gluon orderings. This is achieved by tensoring the original

a specific choice of the coproduct in the algebra of orderings leads to an
antipode in the resulting Hopf algebra that has the interpretation of reversing

The numerical method addresses several complexities presented by the PDE system

the governing equations requires explicit enforcement of the zero-curl property
of certain vector fields (an interface field and a distortion field); the
problem is eliminated entirely by adopting a set of compatible curl and
gradient discrete differential operators on a staggered grid, allowing to
preserve the Schwartz identity of cross-derivatives exactly. (ii) The evolution
equations feature highly nonlinear stiff algebraic source terms which are used
for the description of viscous interactions as emergent behaviour of an
elasto-plastic solid in the stiff strain relaxation limit; such source terms
are reliably integrated with an efficient semi-analytical technique. (iii) In
the low-Mach number regime, standard explicit Godunov-type schemes lose
efficiency and accuracy; the issue is addressed by means of a simple
semi-implicit, pressure-based, split treatment of acoustic and non-acoustic
waves, again using staggered grids that recover the implicit solution for a

the amplitude with on-shell external legs and it has the advantage that they

1PI functions already computed in our previous work (devoted to $WZ \to WZ$).
We will complement them here with the computation of the new 1PI functions

to the system uncertainty which is due to the unknown other generation units'
strategies. Distributed optimization, where each entity or agent decides on its
bid individually, has become state of the art. However, it cannot overcome the
challenges of system uncertainties. Deep reinforcement learning is a promising
approach to learn the optimal strategy in uncertain environments. Nevertheless,
it is not able to integrate the information on the spatial system topology in
the learning process. This paper proposes a distributed learning algorithm
based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with a graph convolutional
neural network (GCN). In fact, the proposed framework helps the agents to
update their decisions by getting feedback from the environment so that it can
overcome the challenges of the uncertainties. In this proposed algorithm, the
state and connection between nodes are the inputs of the GCN, which can make
agents aware of the structure of the system. This information on the system
topology helps the agents to improve their bidding strategies and increase the
profit. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on the IEEE 30-bus system under
different scenarios. Also, to investigate the generalization ability of the
proposed approach, we test the trained model on IEEE 39-bus system. The results
show that the proposed algorithm has more generalization abilities compare to
the DRL and can result in higher profit when changing the topology of the

to collect as much rewards as possible during the process. Despite its
simplicity, the MAB model offers an excellent playground for studying the
trade-off between exploration versus exploitation and designing effective
algorithms for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Although many
asymptotically optimal algorithms have been established, the finite-time
behaviours of the stochastic dynamics of the MAB model appears much more
difficult to analyze, due to the intertwining between the decision-making and
the rewards being collected. In this paper, we employ techniques in statistical

framework of our considering system. Under the incompatible configuration of
the emission profiles, the images of BHs comprise that the observed luminosity
is mainly determined by direct emission, while the lensing ring will provide a
small contribution of the total observed flux and the photon ring makes a
negligible contribution due to its exponential narrowness. More importantly,
the observed regions and specific intensities of all emission profiles are
changed correspondingly under variations of parameters. For optically thin
accreting matters, we analyze the profile and specific intensity of the shadows
with static and infalling accretions models, respectively. We find that with an
infalling motion the interior region of the shadows will be darker than in a
static case, due to the Doppler effect of the infalling movement. Finally, it
is concluded that these findings support that the change of BH state parameters

independently for many downstream tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, relation
detection, etc.). Multimodal approaches that study both domains have not been
well explored, even though in recent years, multimodal learning has been seen
to be more powerful than its unimodal counterparts. In this study, we want to
explore the relationship and dependency between EEG and language, i.e., how one
domain reflects and represents the other. To study the relationship at the
representation level, we introduced MTAM, a MultimodalTransformer Alignment
Model, to observe coordinated representations between the two modalities, and
thus employ the transformed representations for downstream applications. We
used various relationship alignment-seeking techniques, such as Canonical
Correlation Analysis and Wasserstein Distance, as loss functions to transfigure
low-level language and EEG features to high-level transformed features. On
downstream applications, sentiment analysis and relation detection, we achieved
new state-of-the-art results on two datasets, ZuCo and K-EmoCon. Our method
achieved an F1-score improvement of 16.5% on sentiment analysis for K-EmoCon,
27% on sentiment analysis of ZuCo, and 31.1% on relation detection of ZuCo. In
addition, we provide interpretations of the performance improvement by: (1)
visualizing the original feature distribution and the transformed feature
distribution, showing the effectiveness of the alignment module for discovering
and encoding the relationship between EEG and language; (2) visualizing
word-level and sentence-level EEG-language alignment weights, showing the
influence of different language semantics as well as EEG frequency features;
and (3) visualizing brain topographical maps to provide an intuitive
demonstration of the connectivity of EEG and language response in the brain
regions.

joint actuated by a single pneumatic artificial muscle (PAM), a cascaded
control strategy is proposed based on the robust modeling method. Firstly, the
relationship between the input voltage of the proportional directional control
valve and the inner driving pressure of PAM is expressed as a nonlinear model
analytically. Secondly, the nonlinear relationship between the driving pressure
input of PAM and the angular position output of the bionic joint is described
as a second-order linear time-invariant model (LTI) accompanied by parametric
perturbations, equivalently, and then the parameters of the model are
identified by the robust modeling method. Then, a hybrid model is established
based on the two models (the nonlinear model and the LTI model) and
corresponding to it, a cascaded controller is developed, the outer loop of
which is an H-infinite controller for the angular position tracking designed by
loop-shaping design procedure (LSDP) and the inner loop is a nonlinear
controller based on the feedback linearization theory for the PAM driving
pressure control. Finally, the experiment is accomplished within the joint
rotation range of 90 degrees and with the working frequency upper bound of 1.25
rad/s. And the joint with the developed cascaded controller tracks given
reference trajectories with steady-state errors smaller than 2%. Results show
that the trajectory tracking control of a highly nonlinear system is highly
efficient using the proposed strategy in the case of relatively low work

  Classification",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG physics.ins-det","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  High energy density physics (HEDP) experiments commonly involve a dynamic
wave-front propagating inside a low-density foam. This effect affects its
density and hence, its transparency. A common problem in foam production is the
creation of defective foams. Accurate information on their dimension and
homogeneity is required to classify the foams' quality. Therefore, those
parameters are being characterized using a 3D-measuring laser confocal
microscope. For each foam, five images are taken: two 2D images representing
the top and bottom surface foam planes and three images of side cross-sections
from 3D scannings. An expert has to do the complicated, harsh, and exhausting
work of manually classifying the foam's quality through the image set and only
then determine whether the foam can be used in experiments or not. Currently,
quality has two binary levels of normal vs. defective. At the same time,
experts are commonly required to classify a sub-class of normal-defective,
i.e., foams that are defective but might be sufficient for the needed
experiment. This sub-class is problematic due to inconclusive judgment that is
primarily intuitive. In this work, we present a novel state-of-the-art
multi-view deep learning classification model that mimics the physicist's
perspective by automatically determining the foams' quality classification and
thus aids the expert. Our model achieved 86\% accuracy on upper and lower
surface foam planes and 82\% on the entire set, suggesting interesting
heuristics to the problem. A significant added value in this work is the
ability to regress the foam quality instead of binary deduction and even
explain the decision visually. The source code used in this work, as well as

technology. Recently, they have also been used in active switching, adaptive
optics, and next-generation displays for augmented and virtual reality. This is
due to the diverse properties of their various phases and the growing physical
understanding of LCs. Our goal is to examine the applicability of a new method
in determining these quantities for thermotropic uniaxial nematic liquid
crystals (NLCs), even though nearly all theoretical and experimental efforts
are focused on a deeper understanding of the temperature-dependent free energy
behavior and other quantities related to it, especially in the vicinity of the
first- and second-order phase transitions of LCs. The method that is being
discussed is based on Fresnel diffraction (FD) from phase objects, which has
found a wide range of precise metrological applications over the past two
decades. Diffractometry is a very sensitive, accurate, and immune technique
that can convert any change in the order of LCs as a function of temperature
into a change in the optical phase and, as a result, a recordable change in the
visibility of the light diffraction pattern from phase steps. This contrasts
with interferometry, which is very sensitive to environmental changes.
Theoretical investigations, numerical calculations, and comparisons of the
results with experimental observations in turn demonstrate very high compliance
with the output of other existing methods. As we will see, this method has the
potential to not only strengthen existing approaches by addressing some of
their flaws and shortcomings but also to take its place next to them.

learning research papers for predicting and classifying mTBI in terms of 1) EEG
data types, 2) data preprocessing methods, 3) machine learning feature
representations, 4) feature extraction methods, and 5) machine learning
classifiers and predictions. The most common EEG data type was human
resting-state EEG, with most studies using filters to clean the data. The power
spectral, especially alpha and theta power, was the most prevalent feature. The
other non-power spectral features, such as entropy, also show their great

while using neural networks as automatic feature extraction generally returns a
high accuracy result. Lastly, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was our survey's
most common ML classifier due to its lower computational complexity and solid
mathematical theoretical basis. The purpose of this study was to collect and
explore a sparsely populated sector of ML, and we hope that our survey has

to describe the development of the policy in real-time, which encompasses
handling of incurred-but-not-reported and reported-but-not-settled claims. We
give a fundamental treatment of the problem in the setting of continuous-time
multi-state life insurance by introducing a new class of models: transaction
time models. The relation between the transaction time model and the classic
model is studied and a result linking the present values in the two models is
derived. The results and their practical implications are illustrated for
disability coverages, where we obtain explicit expressions for the transaction
time reserve in specific models.

  free-space optical communication link",,,,,"physics.optics eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In laser-based free-space optical communication, besides OAM beams,
Hermite-Gaussian (HG) modes or HG-mode coherently composed states (HG-MCCS) can
also be adopted as the information carrier to extend the channel capacity with
the spatial pattern based encoding and decoding link. The light field of
HG-MCCS is mainly determined by three independent parameters, including indexes
of HG modes, relative initial phases between two eigenmodes, and scale
coefficients of the eigenmodes, which can obtain a large number of effective
coding modes at a low mode order. The beam intensity distributions of the
HG-MCCSs have obvious distinguishable spatial characteristics and can keep
propagation invariance, which are convenient to be decoded by the convolutional
neural network (CNN) based image recognition method. We experimentally utilize
HG-MCCS to realize a communication link including encoding, transmission under
atmospheric turbulence (AT), and decoding based on CNN. With the index order of
eigenmodes within six, 125 HG-MCCS are generated and used for information
encoding, and the average recognition accuracy reached 99.5% for non-AT
conditions. For the 125-level color images transmission, the error rate of the
system is less than 1.8% even under the weak AT condition. Our work provides a
useful basis for the future combination of dense data communication and
artificial intelligence technology.
