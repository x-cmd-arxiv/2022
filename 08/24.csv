are fed by infalling circumstellar gas and dust which may be shock-heated upon
accretion or sublimated while passing through an optically thin gap. Accreted
material is then either incorporated into moons, falls into the planet, or is
lost beyond the disk edge on relatively short timescales. If ices are
sublimated during accretion onto the CPD we know there must be sufficient time
for them to recondense or moons such as Ganymede or Callisto could not form.
The chemical timescale to form sufficiently icy solids places a novel
constraint on the dynamical behaviour and properties of CPDs. We use the
radiation thermochemical code ProDiMo to analyze how the radial ice abundance
evolves in CPDs. We consider different initial chemical conditions of the disk
to explore the consequences of infalling material being inherited from the
circumstellar disk or being reset to atomic conditions by shock-heating. We
contrast the timescales of ice formation with those of viscous evolution and
radial dust drift. Water ice can form very efficiently in the CPD from
initially atomic conditions, as a significant fraction is efficiently
re-deposited on dust grains within < 1 yr. Radial grain drift timescales are in
general longer than those of ice formation on grains. Icy grains of size $a <
3$ mm retain their icy mantles while crossing an optically thin circumstellar
disk gap at 5 au for $L_* < 10 $ L$_{\odot}$. Three-body reactions play an
important role in water formation in the dense midplane condition of CPDs. The
CPD midplane must be depleted in dust relative to the circumstellar disk by a
factor 10-50 to produce solids with the ice to rock ratio of the icy Galilean
satellites. The CPD snowline is not erased by radial grain drift, which is
consistent with the compositional gradient of the Galilean satellites being
primordial.

increasingly recognized by modern cosmological simulations as a
resolution-independent means to implement the effects of feedback in galaxies,

is uncertain due to the effects of SN clustering and interstellar medium (ISM)
inhomogeneities. In this paper, we use spatially-resolved observations of the
prominent 10-kpc star-forming ring of M31 to test models of mass-weighted ISM
turbulence driven by momentum feedback from isolated, non-overlapping SNRs. We
use a detailed stellar-age distribution (SAD) map from the Panchromatic Hubble
Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey, observationally-constrained SN delay-time
distributions, and maps of the atomic and molecular hydrogen to estimate the
mass-weighted velocity dispersion using the Martizzi et al. ISM turbulence
model. Our estimates are within a factor of 2 of the observed mass-weighted
velocity dispersion in most of the ring, but exceed observations at densities
$\lesssim 0.2$ cm$^{-3}$ and SN rates $>2.1\times 10^{-4}$ SN yr$^{-1}$
kpc$^{-2}$, even after accounting for plausible variations in stellar-age
distribution models and ISM scale height assumptions. We conclude that at high
SN rates the momentum deposited is most likely suppressed by the non-linear
effects of SN clustering, while at low densities, SNRs reach pressure
equilibrium before the cooling phase. These corrections should be introduced in
models of momentum-driven feedback and ISM turbulence.

  Encoding the Training Labels",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Class imbalance, which is also called long-tailed distribution, is a common
problem in classification tasks based on machine learning. If it happens, the
minority data will be overwhelmed by the majority, which presents quite a
challenge for data science. To address the class imbalance problem, researchers
have proposed lots of methods: some people make the data set balanced (SMOTE),
some others refine the loss function (Focal Loss), and even someone has noticed
the value of labels influences class-imbalanced learning (Yang and Xu.
Rethinking the value of labels for improving class-imbalanced learning. In
NeurIPS 2020), but no one changes the way to encode the labels of data yet.
Nowadays, the most prevailing technique to encode labels is the one-hot
encoding due to its nice performance in the general situation. However, it is
not a good choice for imbalanced data, because the classifier will treat
majority and minority samples equally. In this paper, we innovatively propose
the enhancement encoding technique, which is specially designed for the
imbalanced classification. The enhancement encoding combines re-weighting and
cost-sensitiveness, which can reflect the difference between hard and easy (or
minority and majority) classes. To reduce the number of validation samples and
the computation cost, we also replace the confusion matrix with a novel
soft-confusion matrix which works better with a small validation set. In the
experiments, we evaluate the enhancement encoding with three different types of
loss. And the results show that enhancement encoding is very effective to
improve the performance of the network trained with imbalanced data.
Particularly, the performance on minority classes is much better.

significant attention as a potential candidate for achieving a quantum

kernel-based model one is guaranteed to find the optimal model's parameters due
to the convexity of the training landscape. However, this is based on the
assumption that the quantum kernel can be efficiently obtained from a quantum
hardware. In this work we study the trainability of quantum kernels from the
perspective of the resources needed to accurately estimate kernel values. We
show that, under certain conditions, values of quantum kernels over different
input data can be exponentially concentrated (in the number of qubits) towards
some fixed value, leading to an exponential scaling of the number of
measurements required for successful training. We identify four sources that
can lead to concentration including: the expressibility of data embedding,
global measurements, entanglement and noise. For each source, an associated
concentration bound of quantum kernels is analytically derived. Lastly, we show
that when dealing with classical data, training a parametrized data embedding
with a kernel alignment method is also susceptible to exponential
concentration. Our results are verified through numerical simulations for
several QML tasks. Altogether, we provide guidelines indicating that certain
features should be avoided to ensure the efficient evaluation and the
trainability of quantum kernel methods.

exploring whether magnetic fields are only passive constituents of the
interstellar medium, or whether they are active constituents being part of the
local energy equilibrium. Methods. We measure equipartition magnetic field
strengths in 39 galaxies from LoTSS-DR2 using LOFAR observations at 144 MHz
with 6 arcsec angular resolution which (0.1-0.7 kpc). For a subset of 9
galaxies, we obtain atomic and molecular mass surface densities using HI and
CO(2-1) data, from the THINGS and HERACLES surveys, respectively. These data
are at 13 arcsec angular resolution, which corresponds to 0.3-1.2 kpc at the
distances of our galaxies. We measure kinetic energy densities using HI and CO
velocity dispersions. Results. We found a mean magnetic field strength of
3.6-12.5 $\mu$G with a mean of $7.9 \pm 2.0$ $\mu$G across the full sample. The
magnetic field strength has the tightest and steepest relation with the total
gas surface density with $B\propto \Sigma_{\rm HI+H2}^{0.309\pm0.006}$. The
relation with the star-formation rate surface density and molecular gas surface
density has significantly flatter slopes. After accounting for the influence of
cosmic-ray transport, we found an even steeper relation of $B\propto
\Sigma_{\rm HI+H2}^{0.393\pm0.009}$. Conclusions. These results suggest that
the magnetic field is regulated by a $B$-$\rho$ relation, which has its origin
in the saturation of the small-scale dynamo. This is borne out by an agreement
of kinetic and magnetic energy densities although local deviations do exist in
particular in areas of high kinetic energy densities where the magnetic field
is sub-dominant.

with three Bubbles -- Intimate, Conversation, and Social Bubble -- generating
spatial audio feedback to distinguish avatars in different bubbles and provide
suitable avatar information. We provide three audio alternatives: earcons,
verbal notifications, and real-world sound effects. PVI can select and combine
their preferred feedback alternatives for different avatars, bubbles, and
social contexts. We evaluated VRBubble and an audio beacon baseline with 12 PVI
in a navigation and a conversation context. We found that VRBubble
significantly enhanced participants' avatar awareness during navigation and
enabled avatar identification in both contexts. However, VRBubble was shown to
be more distracting in crowded environments.

truth: bugs in real programs with known root causes and triggering inputs are
difficult to collect at a meaningful scale. Bug injection technologies that add
synthetic bugs into real programs seem to offer a solution, but the differences
in finding these synthetic bugs versus organic bugs have not previously been
explored at a large scale. Using over 80 years of CPU time, we ran eight
fuzzers across 20 targets from the Rode0day bug-finding competition and the
LAVA-M corpus. Experiments were standardized with respect to compute resources
and metrics gathered. These experiments show differences in fuzzer performance
as well as the impact of various configuration options. For instance, it is
clear that integrating symbolic execution with mutational fuzzing is very
effective and that using dictionaries improves performance. Other conclusions
are less clear-cut; for example, no one fuzzer beat all others on all tests. It
is noteworthy that no fuzzer found any organic bugs (i.e., one reported in a
CVE), despite 50 such bugs being available for discovery in the fuzzing corpus.
A close analysis of results revealed a possible explanation: a dramatic
difference between where synthetic and organic bugs live with respect to the
''main path'' discovered by fuzzers. We find that recent updates to bug
injection systems have made synthetic bugs more difficult to discover, but they
are still significantly easier to find than organic bugs in our target
programs. Finally, this study identifies flaws in bug injection techniques and
suggests a number of axes along which synthetic bugs should be improved.

leads to the phenomenon of an oscillating bound state, where excitations

calculations for the oscillating BICs in a 1D photonic lattice coupled to a

previous proposals of oscillating BICs in continuous waveguide systems due to
the presence of a finite energy band contributing band-edge effects. In
particular, we show that the bound states outside the energy band are
detrimental to the oscillating BIC phenomenon, and can be suppressed by
increasing either the number of coupling points or the separation between each
coupling point. Crucially, non-Markovianity is necessary for the existence of
oscillating BIC, and the oscillation amplitude increases with the
characteristic delay time of the giant atom interactions. We also propose a
novel initialization scheme in the BIC subspace. Our work be experimentally
implemented on current photonic waveguide array platforms and opens up new
prospects in utilizing reservoir engineering for the storage of quantum

as geology, astrophysics, and soft matter. Sometimes, sedimentation leads to
unusual phenomena, such as the Brazil-nut effect, where heavier (granular)
particles reside on top of lighter particles after shaking. We show
experimentally for the first time that a Brazil-nut effect can be realised in a
binary colloidal system of long-range repulsive charged particles driven purely
by Brownian motion and electrostatics, without the need for activity. Using
theory, we argue that not only the mass-per-charge for the heavier particles
needs to be smaller than the mass-per-charge for the lighter particles, but
that at high overall density the system can be trapped in a long-lived
metastable state, which prevents the occurrence of the equilibrium Brazil-nut
effect. Therefore, we envision that our work provides valuable insights into
the physics of strongly interacting systems, such as partially glassy and
crystalline structures. Finally, our theory, that quantitatively agrees with
the experimental data, predicts that the shapes of sedimentation density
profiles of multicomponent charged colloids is greatly altered when the
particles are charge regulating with more than two ion species involved. Hence,
we hypothesise that sedimentation experiments can aid in revealing the type of
ion-adsorption processes that determine the particle charge, and possibly also
the value of the corresponding equilibrium constants.

video transformers have recently dominated the efficiency (top-1 accuracy vs

transformer architecture, advocating the use of simpler approaches for token

where the self-attention operator has a significantly higher impact (compared
to the case of images) on efficiency. To address this gap, in this paper, we
make the following contributions: (a) we construct a highly efficient \&
accurate attention-free block based on the shift operator, coined Affine-Shift
block, specifically designed to approximate as closely as possible the
operations in the MHSA block of a Transformer layer. Based on our Affine-Shift
block, we construct our Affine-Shift Transformer and show that it already
outperforms all existing shift/MLP--based architectures for ImageNet

recent state-of-the-art transformers on the most popular action recognition

Macaulay-Matlis duality, where the sequence of initial degrees of the family of
symbolic powers of a radical ideal is dual to the sequence of
Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity values of a quotient by ideals generated by
powers of linear forms. This philosophy is drawn from an influential paper of
Emsalem and Iarrobino. We generalize this duality to differentially closed
graded filtrations of ideals.
  In a different direction, we establish a duality between the sequence of
Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity values of the symbolic powers of certain ideals
and a geometrically inspired sequence we term the jet separation sequence. We
show that this duality underpins the reciprocity between two important
geometric invariants: the multipoint Seshadri constant and the asymptotic

initialize a single trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion from the motional ground state
into coherent states with $|\alpha|$ up to 12 using electric voltages on the

self-sustained biomolecular oscillations of a neuronal network located in the

synchronized to the day-night cycle due to signaling from the retina.
Misalignment of these neuronal oscillations with the external light signal can

We obtain that the shell thermodynamics is fully described by giving two
additional reduced equations of state, one for the temperature and another for
the electrostatic potential. We choose the equation of state for the
temperature as a power law in the gravitational radius $r_+$ with exponent $a$,
such that the $a=1$ case gives the temperature of a shell with black hole

equation of state characteristic of a Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole
spacetime. The entropy of the shell is found to be proportional to $A_+^a$,
where $A_+$ is the gravitational area corresponding to $r_+$, with $a>0$. We
are then able to perform the black hole limit $R=r_+$, find the Smarr formula,
and recover the thermodynamics of a $d$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\""om black

chosen equations of state. We obtain that for $0<a\leq \frac{d-3}{d-2}$ all the
configurations of the shell are thermodynamically stable, for
$\frac{d-3}{d-2}<a<1$ stability depends on the mass and electric charge, and
for $a>1$ all the configurations are unstable, except for the shell at its own
gravitational radius, which is marginally stable. We rewrite the stability
conditions in terms of laboratory variables. We find that the sufficient
condition for the stability of these shells is when the isothermal electric
susceptibility $\chi_{p,T}$ is positive, marginal stability happening when this
quantity is infinite, and instability arising for configurations with a
negative electric susceptibility.

large sample of high-mass protostars. From the ALMAGAL survey, 37 of the most
line-rich hot molecular cores are selected. Next, we fit their spectra and find
column densities and excitation temperatures of the above N-bearing species, in
addition to CH$_3$OH. We (tentatively) detect CH$_3$NH$_2$ in $\sim32%$ of the
sources. We find three groups of species when comparing their excitation
temperatures: hot (NH$_2$CHO; Tex > 250 K), warm (C$_2$H$_3$CN, HN$^{13}$CO and
CH$_{3}^{13}$CN; 100 K < Tex < 250 K) and cold species (CH$_3$OH and
CH$_3$NH$_2$; Tex < 100 K). This temperature segregation reflects the trend
seen in their sublimation temperatures and validates the idea of onion-like
structure of COMs around protostars. Moreover, the molecules studied here show
constant column density ratios across low- and high-mass protostars with
scatter less than a factor $\sim3$ around the mean. The constant column density
ratios point to a common formation environment of COMs or their precursors,
most likely in the pre-stellar ices. The scatter around the mean of the ratios,
although small, varies depending on the species considered. This spread can
either have a physical origin (source structure, line or dust optical depth) or
a chemical one. Formamide is most prone to the physical effects as it is
tracing the closest regions to the protostars, whereas such effects are small
for other species. Assuming that all molecules form in the pre-stellar ices,
the scatter variations could be explained by differences in lifetimes or
physical conditions of the pre-stellar clouds. If the pre-stellar lifetimes are
the main factor, they should be similar for low- and high-mass protostars.

without the need for fine tunings. We obtain simple analytic results for the
dark energy equation of state and dependence on model parameters. In this

long-wavelength gravitational waves, with implications for the experimental
search for cosmic microwave background B-modes and direct detection of a

their computational stencil maps well to modern GPU devices, further raising

address this by invoking an artificial viscosity field to supply required

Navier-Stokes equations for compressible fluids. We show that our approach
results in sub-cell shock capturing ability, unlike traditional limiting

phase-space information provided by the Gaia Data Release 3, we discover
unambiguous signatures of phase-mixing in the stellar halo around the Sun. We
show that for the stars likely belonging to the last massive merger, the
(v_r,r) distribution contains a series of long and thin chevron-like
overdensities. These phase-space sub-structures are predicted to emerge
following the dissolution of a satellite, when its tidal debris is given time
to wind up, thin out and fold. Additionally, the observed energy and angular
momentum (E, L_z) distribution appears more prograde at high energies, possibly
revealing the original orbital angular momentum of the in-falling galaxy. The
energy distribution of the debris is strongly asymmetric with a peak at low E
-- which, we surmise, may be evidence of the dwarf's rapid sinking -- and
riddled with wrinkles and bumps. If these small-scale energy inhomogeneities
have been seeded during or immediately after the interaction with the Milky
Way, and are not due to the spatial restriction of our study, then making use
of the (v_r,r) chevrons to constrain the time of the merger becomes cumbersome.
Nonetheless, we demonstrate that similar phase-space and (E,L_z) sub-structures
are present in numerical simulations of galaxy interactions, both in bespoke
N-body runs and in cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in suites. The remnant
traces of the progenitor's disruption and the signatures of the on-going

whether finite-time protocols for preparing long-range entangled (LRE) states
lead to phases of matter which are stable to gate imperfections. Here we show
that such gate imperfections effectively convert projective into weak
measurements and that, in certain cases, long-range entanglement persists, even
in the presence of weak measurements and gives rise to novel forms of quantum
criticality. We demonstrate this explicitly for preparing the two-dimensional
(2D) GHZ cat state and the three-dimensional (3D) toric code as minimal
instances. In contrast to previous studies on measurement-induced phases and
transitions, our circuit of gates and measurements is deterministic; the only
randomness is in the measurement outcomes. We show how the randomness in these
weak measurements allows us to track the solvable Nishimori line of the
random-bond Ising model, rigorously establishing the stability of the glassy
LRE states in two and three spatial dimensions. Away from this exactly solvable
construction, we use hybrid tensor network and Monte Carlo simulations to
obtain a non-zero Edwards-Anderson order parameter as an indicator of
long-range entanglement in the 2D scenario. We argue that our protocol admits a
natural implementation in existing quantum computing architectures, requiring
only a depth-3 circuit on IBM's heavy-hexagon transmon chips.

grains, greatly affecting the resulting dust properties of the interstellar
medium (ISM). While these processes have been extensively studied
theoretically, observational constraints are limited. We use
physically-motivated models of dust emission to fit the infrared (IR) spectral
energy distributions of seven Galactic supernova remnants, allowing us to
determine the distribution of dust mass between diffuse and dense gas phases,
and between large and small grain sizes. We find that the dense ($\sim 10^3
\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$), relatively cool ($\sim 10^3 \, {\rm K}$) gas phase contains
$>90\%$ of the dust mass, making the warm dust located in the X-ray emitting
plasma ($\sim 1 \,{\rm cm}^{-3}$/$10^6 \, {\rm K}$) a negligible fraction of
the total, despite dominating the mid-IR emission. The ratio of small
($\lesssim 10 \, {\rm nm}$) to large ($\gtrsim 0.1 \, {\rm \mu m}$) grains in
the cold component is consistent with that in the ISM, and possibly even
higher, whereas the hot phase is almost entirely devoid of small grains. This
suggests that grain shattering, which processes large grains into smaller ones,
is ineffective in the low-density gas, contrary to model predictions.
Single-phase models of dust destruction in the ISM, which do not account for
the existence of the cold swept-up material containing most of the dust mass,
are likely to greatly overestimate the rate of dust destruction by supernovae.

MD-FAS, we construct a new benchmark based on SIW, SIW-Mv2 and Oulu-NPU, and
introduce four distinct protocols for evaluation, where source and target

generate an entangling two-qubit gate. However, the fidelity of such an
operation will be reduced by a variety of error mechanisms such as charge and
magnetic noise, phonons, cavity loss, transitions to non-qubit states and, for
electrons in silicon, excitation into other valley eigenstates. Here, we model
the effects of these error sources and the valley degree of freedom on the
performance of a cavity-mediated two-qubit iSWAP gate. For valley splittings
inadequately large relative to the interdot tunnel coupling within each qubit,
we find that valley excitation may be a limiter to the fidelity of this
two-qubit gate. In addition, we show tradeoffs between gating times and
exposure to various error sources, identifying optimal operating regimes and
device improvements that would have the greatest impact on the fidelity of the
cavity-mediated spin iSWAP. Importantly, we find that while the impact of
charge noise and phonon relaxation favor operation in the regime where the
qubits are most spin-like to reduce sensitivity to these sources of noise, the
combination of hyperfine noise and valley physics shifts the optimal regime to
charge-like qubits with stronger effective spin-photon coupling so that gate
times can be made as short as possible. In this regime, the primary limitation
is the need to avoid Landau-Zener transitions as the gate is implemented.

  For a less detailed version, skip all proofs of something being well-defined.
  Comments are welcome! v3 adds Proposition 14.2",,,,"math.CO math.RA","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  We extend the periodicity of birational rowmotion for rectangular posets to
the case when the base field is replaced by a noncommutative ring (under
appropriate conditions). This resolves a conjecture from 2014. The proof uses a
novel approach and is fully self-contained.
  Consider labellings of a finite poset $P$ by $\left|P\right| + 2$ elements of
a ring $\mathbb{K}$: one label associated with each poset element and two
constant labels for the added top and bottom elements in $\hat{P}$. *Birational
rowmotion* is a partial map on such labellings. It was originally defined by
Einstein and Propp for $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ as a lifting (via
detropicalization) of *piecewise-linear rowmotion*, a map on the order polytope
$\mathcal{O}(P) := \{\text{order-preserving } f: P \to[0,1]\}$. The latter, in
turn, extends the well-studied rowmotion map on the set of order ideals (or
more properly, the set of order filters) of $P$, which correspond to the
vertices of $\mathcal{O}(P)$. Dynamical properties of these combinatorial maps
sometimes (but not always) extend to the birational level, while results proven
at the birational level always imply their combinatorial counterparts. Allowing
$\mathbb{K}$ to be noncommutative, we generalize the birational level even
further, and some properties are in fact lost at this step.
  In 2014, the authors gave the first proof of periodicity for birational
rowmotion on rectangular posets (when $P$ is a product of two chains) for
$\mathbb{K}$ a field, and conjectured that it survives (in an appropriately
twisted form) in the noncommutative case. In this paper, we prove this
noncommutative periodicity and a concomitant antipodal reciprocity formula. We
end with some conjectures about periodicity for other posets, and the question
of whether our results can be extended to (noncommutative) semirings.

solve the coupled time-domain Maxwell's equations and polarization equation. We
define a new and sharpened total energy function for the Cole-Cole model, which
better describes the behaviors of the energy than what is available in the
current literature. A major theme in the time-domain numerical modeling of this
problem has been tackling the difficulty of handling the nonlocal term involved
in the time-domain polarization equation. Based on the diffusive representation
and the quadrature formula, we derive an approximate system, where the
convolution kernel is replaced by a finite number of auxiliary variables that
satisfy local-in-time ordinary differential equations. To ensure the resulted
approximate system is stable, a nonlinear constrained optimization numerical
scheme is established to determine the quadrature coefficients. By a special
choice of the numerical fluxes and projections, we obtain {for the constant
coefficient case } an optimal-order convergence result for the semi-discrete DG
scheme. The temporal discretization is achieved by the standard two-step
backward difference formula and a fast algorithm with linear complexity is
constructed. Numerical examples are provided for demonstrating the efficiency
of the proposed algorithm, validating the theoretical results and illustrating
the behaviors of the energy.

is an NP-hard non-convex problem. Thanks to powerful results from real
algebraic geometry, one can convert this problem into a nested sequence of
finite-dimensional convex problems. At each step of the associated hierarchy,
one needs to solve a fixed size semidefinite program, which can be in turn
solved with efficient numerical tools. On the practical side however, there is
no-free lunch and such optimization methods usually encompass severe
scalability issues. Fortunately, for many applications, we can look at the
problem in the eyes and exploit the inherent data structure arising from the
cost and constraints describing the problem, for instance sparsity or
symmetries.
  This book presents several research efforts to tackle this scientific
challenge with important computational implications, and provides the
development of alternative optimization schemes that scale well in terms of
computational complexity, at least in some identified class of problems. The
presented algorithmic framework in this book mainly exploits the sparsity
structure of the input data to solve large-scale polynomial optimization
problems. We present sparsity-exploiting hierarchies of relaxations, for either
unconstrained or constrained problems. By contrast with the dense hierarchies,
they provide faster approximation of the solution in practice but also come
with the same theoretical convergence guarantees. Our framework is not
restricted to static polynomial optimization, and we expose hierarchies of
approximations for values of interest arising from the analysis of dynamical
systems. We also present various extensions to problems involving noncommuting
variables, e.g., matrices of arbitrary size or quantum physic operators.

occurs in two distinct time scales: a short time scale set by detrainment
moistening the environment (a few hours) and a long time scale (17 days) due to
subsidence drying. The hours-long time scale of detrainment suggests that the
MC feedback is an efficient process relevant to TC genesis in the real world.

two parameters ($b_W$ and $Z_W$) standardizing Cepheid luminosities with period
and metallicity. After reproducing the SH0ES baseline model results, we allow
for a transition of the value of any one of these parameters at a given
distance $D_c$ or cosmic time $t_c$ thus adding a single degree of freedom in
the analysis. When the SnIa absolute magnitude $M_B$ is allowed to have a
transition at $D_c\simeq 50Mpc$ (about $160Myrs$ ago), the best fit value of
the Hubble parameter drops from $H_{0}=73.04\pm1.04\,km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$ to
$H_0=67.32\pm 4.64\, km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$ in full consistency with the Planck

the Planck inverse distance ladder value $M_{B}^>=-19.43\pm 0.15$ while the low
distance best fit $M_B^<$ parameter remains close to the original distance
ladder calibrated value $M_{B}^<=-19.25\pm 0.03$. Similar hints for a

50\,Mpc$ even though in that case the best fit value of $H_0$ is not
significantly affected. When the inverse distance ladder constraint on $M_B^>$
is included in the analysis, the uncertainties for $H_0$ reduce dramatically
($H_0= 68.2\pm 0.8\, km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$) and the $M_B$ transition model is
strongly preferred over the baseline SH0ES model ($\Delta \chi^2 \simeq -15$,

a single unit. In UML, an aggregation is a type of association in which objects
are configured together to form a more complex object. It has been described as
one of the biggest betes noires in modeling. In spite of its widespread use,
aggregation seems a troublesome concept. It is sometimes treated as part-of;
however, the part-of relation is only one of many possible aggregation
mechanisms and is itself problematical, partly because of its diverse
semantics. The purpose of this paper is to develop a semantic assembly model
that is useful to represent relationships in the domain and achieve various
levels of interoperability among software. The paper contributes to ontological
conceptual clarity about aggregation, based on a model called a thinging
machine (TM). The TM model uses so-called thimacs (things/machines) as building
blocks for describing the domain. Thus, the notion of aggregation is extended
to behavioral aggregation, in which individual entities collectively behave as
a unit. The results point to a promising contribution to the understanding of
the notion of aggregation compared to the ontological positions that are based

manners that languages utilize to express word relations give rise to unique
pattern structural distributions. Furthermore, fluctuations of these pattern
distributions for a given language can allow us to determine both the
historical period when the text was written and its author. Taken together, our
results emphasize the relevance of ordinal time series analysis in linguistic
typology, historical linguistics and stylometry.

evaluate the methods using the accuracy metric. Results show that the
appropriate selection of data augmentation can drastically improve the model

the light-cone gauge formulation of self-dual Yang-Mills theory and self-dual
gravity, and explore also a deformation of the latter. The recently discussed
$w_{1+\infty}$ algebra in self-dual gravity arises from the soft expansion of
an area-preserving diffeomorphism algebra, which plays the role of the
kinematic algebra in the colour-kinematics duality and the double copy relation
between the self-dual theories. The $W_{1+\infty}$ deformation of

theory is interpreted as a constrained chiral higher-spin gravity, where the
field is a tower of higher-spin components fully constrained by the graviton

expansion exhibits the colour-kinematics duality: the implicit `left algebra'
is the self-dual kinematic algebra, while the `right algebra' provides the
structure constants of the operator-product expansion, ensuring its
associativity at tree level. In a scattering amplitudes version of the Ward

of theories. In particular, it enforces the vanishing of the tree-level

computation to yield a confident prediction, multi-exit networks are gaining
attention as a prominent approach for pushing the limits of efficient
deployment. Multi-exit networks endow a backbone model with early exits,
allowing to obtain predictions at intermediate layers of the model and thus
save computation time and/or energy. However, current various designs of
multi-exit networks are only considered to achieve the best trade-off between
resource usage efficiency and prediction accuracy, the privacy risks stemming
from them have never been explored. This prompts the need for a comprehensive
investigation of privacy risks in multi-exit networks.
  In this paper, we perform the first privacy analysis of multi-exit networks
through the lens of membership leakages. In particular, we first leverage the
existing attack methodologies to quantify the multi-exit networks'
vulnerability to membership leakages. Our experimental results show that
multi-exit networks are less vulnerable to membership leakages and the exit
(number and depth) attached to the backbone model is highly correlated with the
attack performance. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid attack that exploits the
exit information to improve the performance of existing attacks. We evaluate
membership leakage threat caused by our hybrid attack under three different
adversarial setups, ultimately arriving at a model-free and data-free
adversary. These results clearly demonstrate that our hybrid attacks are very
broadly applicable, thereby the corresponding risks are much more severe than
shown by existing membership inference attacks. We further present a defense
mechanism called TimeGuard specifically for multi-exit networks and show that
TimeGuard mitigates the newly proposed attacks perfectly.

  $^{75}$As","7 pages,3 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevC.106.065503",,"nucl-ex","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background: Low energy $\beta$ and electron capture (EC) decays are important
systems in neutrino mass determination experiments. An isotope with an
ultra-low Q value $\beta$-decay to an excited state in the daughter with Qes <
1 keV could provide a promising alternative candidate for future experiments.
$^{75}$Se EC and $^{75}$Ge $\beta$-decay represent such candidates, but a more
precise determination of the mass of the common daughter, $^{75}$As, is
required to evaluate whether their potential decay branches are energetically
allowed and ultra-low. Purpose: Perform a precise atomic mass measurement of
$^{75}$As and combine the result with the precisely known atomic masses of
$^{75}$Se and $^{75}$Ge, along with nuclear energy level data for $^{75}$As to
evaluate potential ultra-low Q value decay branches in the EC decay of
$^{75}$Se and the $\beta$-decay of $^{75}$Ge. Method: The LEBIT Penning trap
mass spectrometer at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams was used to perform a
high-precision measurement of the atomic mass of $^{75}$As via cyclotron
frequency ratio measurements of $^{75}$As$^{+}$ to a $^{12}$C$_{6}^{+}$
reference ion. Results: The $^{75}$As mass excess was determined to be
ME($^{75}$As)= -73 035.98(43) keV, from which the ground-state to ground-state
Q values for $^{75}$Se EC and $^{75}$Ge $\beta$-decay were determined to be
866.50(44) keV and 1179.01(44) keV, respectively. These results were compared
to energies of excited states in $^{75}$As at 865.4(5) keV and 1172.0(6) keV to
determine Q values of 1.1(7) keV and 7.0(7) keV for the potential ultra-low EC
and $\beta$-decay branches of $^{75}$Se and $^{75}$Ge, respectively.
Conclusion: The $^{75}$Se EC decay to the 865.4 keV excited state in $^{75}$As
is potentially ultra-low with Qes $\approx$ 1 keV. However, a more precise
determination of the 865.4(5) keV level in $^{75}$As is required.

the order of $\sim 10^{-6}$ G and are uniform on scales of $\sim 10$ kpc.
Despite their wide presence in the Universe, their origin remains an open
issue. Even by invoking a dynamo mechanism or a compression effect for magnetic
field amplification, the existence of seed fields before galaxy formation is
still problematic. General Relativity predicts an adiabatic decrease of the
magnetic field evolving as $|\mathbf{B}|\propto 1/a^{2}$, where $a$ is the
scale factor of the Universe. It results in very small primordial fields,
unless the conformal symmetry of the electromagnetic sector is broken. In this
paper, we study the possibility that a natural mechanism for the amplification
of primordial magnetic field can be related to extended teleparallel gravity
$f(T, B)$ models, where $T$ is the torsion scalar, and $B$ the boundary term.
In particular, we consider a non-minimal coupling with gravity in view to break
conformal symmetry in a teleparallel background, investigating, in particular,
the role of boundary term $B$, which can be consider as a further scalar field.
We find that, after solving exactly the $f(T,B)$ field equations both in
inflation and reheating eras, a non-adiabatic behavior of the magnetic field is
always possible, and a strong amplification appears in the reheating epoch. We
also compute the ratio $r=\rho_{B}/ \rho_{\gamma}$ between the magnetic energy
density and the cosmic microwave energy density during inflation, in order to
explain the present value $r\simeq 1$, showing that, in the slow-roll
approximation, power-law teleparallel theories with $B^{n}$ have effects
indistinguishable from metric theories $R^{n}$ where $R$ is the Ricci curvature
scalar..

almost one-third of the world's population. Various studies have demonstrated
that early diagnosis and intervention are often critical to prognosis and
outcome. To this end, the past decade has witnessed the rapid evolvement of
deep learning based smartphone apps, which allow users to conveniently and
timely identify issues that have emerged around their skins. In order to
collect sufficient data needed by deep learning and at the same time protect
patient privacy, federated learning is often used, where individual clients
aggregate a global model while keeping datasets local. However, existing
federated learning frameworks are mostly designed to optimize the overall
performance, while common dermatological datasets are heavily imbalanced. When
applying federated learning to such datasets, significant disparities in
diagnosis accuracy may occur. To address such a fairness issue, this paper
proposes a fairness-aware federated learning framework for dermatological
disease diagnosis. The framework is divided into two stages: In the first in-FL
stage, clients with different skin types are trained in a federated learning
process to construct a global model for all skin types. An automatic weight
aggregator is used in this process to assign higher weights to the client with
higher loss, and the intensity of the aggregator is determined by the level of
difference between losses. In the latter post-FL stage, each client fine-tune
its personalized model based on the global model in the in-FL stage. To achieve
better fairness, models from different epochs are selected for each client to
keep the accuracy difference of different skin types within 0.05. Experiments
indicate that our proposed framework effectively improves both fairness and
accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art.

landscape analysis for optimization problems over the space of permutations.
Many of the computational and analytical tools for fitness landscape analysis,
such as fitness distance correlation, require identifying a distance metric for
measuring the similarity of different solutions to the problem. We begin with a
survey of the available distance metrics for permutations, and then use
principal component analysis to classify these metrics. The result of this
analysis aligns with existing classifications of permutation problem types
produced through less formal means, including the A-permutation, R-permutation,
and P-permutation types, which classifies problems by whether absolute position
of permutation elements, relative positions of elements, or general precedence
of pairs of elements, is the dominant influence over solution fitness.
Additionally, the formal analysis identifies subtypes within these problem
categories. We see that the classification can assist in identifying
appropriate metrics based on optimization problem feature for use in fitness
landscape analysis. Using optimization problems of each class, we also
demonstrate how the classification scheme can subsequently inform the choice of
mutation operator within an evolutionary algorithm. From this, we present a
classification of a variety of mutation operators as a counterpart to that of
the metrics. Our implementations of the permutation metrics, permutation
mutation operators, and associated evolutionary algorithm, are available in a
pair of open source Java libraries. All of the code necessary to recreate our
analysis and experimental results are also available as open source.

agent of the population can hold one of two possible opinions on a given issue
--against or in favor, and interacts with its neighbors following either an
imitation dynamics (voter behavior) or an anti-alignment dynamics (contrarian
behavior): each agent adopts the opinion of a random neighbor with a
time-dependent probability $p(t)$, or takes the opposite opinion with
probability $1-p(t)$. The imitation probability $p(t)$ is controlled by the
social temperature $T$, and varies in time according to a periodic field that
mimics the influence of an external propaganda, so that a voter is more prone
to adopt an opinion aligned with the field. We simulate the model in complete
graph and in lattices, and find that the system exhibits a rich variety of
behaviors as $T$ is varied: opinion consensus for $T=0$, a bimodal behavior for
$T<T_c$, an oscillatory behavior where the mean opinion oscillates in time with
the field for $T>T_c$, and full disorder for $T \gg 1$. The transition
temperature $T_c$ vanishes with the population size $N$ as $T_c \simeq 2/\ln N$

regime, we find a stochastic resonance-like phenomenon at a given temperature

reach a maximum amplitude at an intermediate temperature, and that exhibit a

smoothness assumption, namely requiring the gradients to be Lipschitz. However,
recent evidence shows that this smoothness condition does not capture the
properties of some deep learning objective functions, including the ones
involving Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTMs. Instead, they satisfy a much
more relaxed condition, with potentially unbounded smoothness. Under this
relaxed assumption, it has been theoretically and empirically shown that the
gradient-clipped SGD has an advantage over the vanilla one. In this paper, we
show that clipping is not indispensable for Adam-type algorithms in tackling
such scenarios: we theoretically prove that a generalized SignSGD algorithm can
obtain similar convergence rates as SGD with clipping but does not need
explicit clipping at all. This family of algorithms on one end recovers SignSGD
and on the other end closely resembles the popular Adam algorithm. Our analysis
underlines the critical role that momentum plays in analyzing SignSGD-type and
Adam-type algorithms: it not only reduces the effects of noise, thus removing
the need for large mini-batch in previous analyses of SignSGD-type algorithms,
but it also substantially reduces the effects of unbounded smoothness and
gradient norms. We also compare these algorithms with popular optimizers on a
set of deep learning tasks, observing that we can match the performance of Adam
while beating the others.

battery-powered applications from failing unexpectedly. With the superiority of
reducing the data requirement of model training for new batteries, transfer
learning (TL) emerges as a promising machine learning approach that applies
knowledge learned from a source battery, which has a large amount of data.
However, the determination of whether the source battery model is reasonable
and which part of information can be transferred for SOH estimation are rarely
discussed, despite these being critical components of a successful TL. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes an interpretable TL-based SOH
estimation method by exploiting the temporal dynamic to assist transfer
learning, which consists of three parts. First, with the help of dynamic time
warping, the temporal data from the discharge time series are synchronized,
yielding the warping path of the cycle-synchronized time series responsible for
capacity degradation over cycles. Second, the canonical variates retrieved from
the spatial path of the cycle-synchronized time series are used for
distribution similarity analysis between the source and target batteries.
Third, when the distribution similarity is within the predefined threshold, a
comprehensive target SOH estimation model is constructed by transferring the
common temporal dynamics from the source SOH estimation model and compensating
the errors with a residual model from the target battery. Through a widely-used
open-source benchmark dataset, the estimation error of the proposed method
evaluated by the root mean squared error is as low as 0.0034 resulting in a 77%
accuracy improvement compared with existing methods.

effects of a closed system intertwine with the impact of coupling to an
environment. The system-environment dynamics can then lead to so-called
exceptional points, which are the open-system marker of phase transitions,
i.e., the closing of spectral gaps in the complex spectrum. Even in the
ubiquitous example of the damped harmonic oscillator, the dissipative
environment can lead to an exceptional point, separating between under-damped
and over-damped dynamics at a point of critical damping. Here, we examine the
fate of this exceptional point in the presence of strong correlations, i.e.,
for a nonlinear oscillator. By employing a functional renormalization group
approach, we identify non-perturbative regimes of this model where the
nonlinearity makes the system more robust against the influence of dissipation
and can remove the exceptional point altogether. The melting of the exceptional
point occurs above a critical nonlinearity threshold. Interestingly, the
exceptional point melts faster with increasing temperatures, showing a
surprising flow to coherent dynamics when coupled to a warm environment.

Cosmics are luminous objects, brighter than the background of the sky. Phantoms
are dark objects, with contrast from several to about 50 per cent. We observe a
significant number of objects whose nature is not clear. Flights of single,

astronomical colour system using the colour corrections. Phantom shows the
colour characteristics inherent in an object with zero albedos. It is a
completely black body that does not emit and absorbs all the radiation falling
on it. We see an object because it shields radiation due to Rayleigh
scattering. An object contrast makes it possible to estimate the distance using
colourimetric methods. Phantoms are observed in the troposphere at distances up
to 10 - 12 km. We estimate their size from 3 to 12 meters and speeds up to 15

delay the stakeholders' actions in the form of a mixed strategy equilibrium.
However, it has been recently shown that the mixed strategy equilibria of the
stochastic war of attrition are destabilized by even the slightest degree of
asymmetry between the players. Such extreme instability is contrary to the
widely accepted notion that a mixed strategy equilibrium is the hallmark of the
war of attrition. Motivated by this quandary, we search for a mixed strategy
equilibrium in a stochastic game of investment in the common good. Our results
show that, despite asymmetry, a mixed strategy equilibrium exists if the model
takes into account the repeated investment opportunities. The mixed strategy
equilibrium disappears only if the asymmetry is sufficiently high. Since the
mixed strategy equilibrium is less efficient than pure strategy equilibria, it
behooves policymakers to prevent it by promoting a sufficiently high degree of
asymmetry between the stakeholders through, for example, asymmetric subsidy.

$Fr=U_\infty/ND=\{2,10,\infty\}$. The wake defect velocity ($U_d$) decays
following three stages with different wake decay rates \citep{Spedding1997} as
for a bluff body. However, the transition points among stages do not follow the
expected $Nt = Nx/U_\infty$ values. Comparison with the wake of a circular disk
in similar conditions \citep{Chongsiripinyo2020} quantifies the influence of
the wake generator - bluff versus slender - in stratified flow. The strongly
stratified $Fr=2$ wake is in a resonant state. The steady lee waves strongly
modulate the mean flow and, relative to the disk, the $Fr=2$ spheroid wake
shows an earlier transition from the non-equilibrium (NEQ) stage to the
quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) stage. The NEQ-Q2D transition is followed by a
sharp increase in the turbulent kinetic energy and horizontal wake meanders. At
$Fr=10$, the start of the NEQ stage is delayed. Transfers between kinetic
energy and potential energy reservoirs (both mean and turbulence) are analyzed
and the flows are compared in phase space (local Froude and Reynolds number as
coordinates). Overall, the results of this study point to the difficulty of
finding a universal framework for stratified wake evolution, independent of the
features of the body, and provide insights into how buoyancy effects depend on
the wake generator.

problem as a dual convex problem whose structure is suitable for distributed
optimization using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).
Next, we propose a new method to solve the minimization problem associated with
the ADMM update step that does not rely on any conjugate function. Calculating

when the objective function is non-smooth. To obviate computing any conjugate

established that the NNWT method reaches a zero error on any validation set and
any test set using the two misconducts, as long as the test set is in the

Measurement Unit (IMU) with two Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Positioning
System (GPS) units in an adaptive Kalman filter (KF). The observability
analysis reveals that $i$) integration of a single GPS with IMU does not
constitute an observable system; $ii$) integration of two GPS units with IMU
results in a locally observable system provided that the line connecting two
GPS antennas is not parallel with the vector of the measured acceleration,
i.e., the sum of inertial and gravitational accelerations. The latter case
makes it possible to compensate for the error in the estimated orientation due
to gyro drift and its bias without needing additional instruments for absolute
orientation measurements, e.g., a magnetic compass. Moreover, in order to cope
with the fact that GPS systems sometimes lose their signal and receive
inaccurate position data, the self-tuning filter estimates the covariance
matrix associated with the GPS measurement noise. This allows the KF to
incorporate GPS measurements in the data fusion process heavily only when the
information received by GPS becomes reliably available.

home-built STM capable of ESR at temperatures ranging from 1 K to 10 K. The STM
is incorporated with a home-built Joule-Thomson refrigerator and a 2-axis
vector magnet. Our STM design allows for the deposition of atoms and molecules
directly into the cold STM, eliminating the need to extract the sample for
deposition. In addition, we adopt two methods to apply radio-frequency (RF)
voltages to the tunnel junction, the early design of wiring to the STM tip
directly, and a more recent idea to use an RF antenna. Direct comparisons of
ESR results measured using the two methods and simulations of electric field
distribution around the tunnel junction show that, despite their different
designs and capacitive couplings to the tunnel junction, there is no
discernible difference in the driving and detection of ESR. Furthermore, at a
magnetic field of 1.6 T, we observe ESR signals (near 40 GHz) sustained up to
10 K, which is the highest temperature for ESR-STM measurement reported to
date, to the best of our knowledge. Although the ESR intensity exponentially
decreases with increasing temperature, our ESR-STM system with low noise at the
tunnel junction allows us to measure weak ESR signals with intensities in the
sub-fA range. Our new design of ESR-STM, which is operational in a large
frequency and temperature range, can broaden the use of ESR spectroscopy in STM
and enable the simple modification of existing STM systems, which will
hopefully accelerate a generalized use of ESR-STM.

and uncertainties of the underlying DTM. Numerous algorithms have been
developed to mitigate the errors and uncertainties of DTM. However, most
algorithms involve tricky parameter selection and complicated procedures that
make the algorithm's decision rule obscure, so it is often difficult to explain

algorithms often consider the local neighborhood of each point for
distinguishing non-ground objects, which limits both search radius and
contextual understanding and can be susceptible to errors particularly if point
density varies. This study presents an open-source DTM generation algorithm for
airborne LiDAR data that can consider beyond the local neighborhood and whose
results are easily explainable, predictable, and reliable. The key assumption
of the algorithm is that grounds are smoothly connected while non-grounds are
surrounded by areas having sharp elevation changes. The robustness and

Direct imaging of exoplanets takes advantage of state-of-the-art
adaptive optics (AO) systems, coronagraphy, and post-processing techniques.
Coronagraphs attenuate starlight to mitigate the unfavorable flux ratio between
an exoplanet and its host star. AO systems provide diffraction-limited images
of point sources and minimize optical aberrations that would cause starlight to
leak through coronagraphs. Post-processing techniques then estimate and remove
residual stellar speckles such as noncommon path aberrations (NCPAs) and
diffraction from telescope obscurations. Aims. We aim to demonstrate an
efficient method to minimize the speckle intensity due to NCPAs during an
observing night on VLT/SPHERE. Methods. We implement an iterative dark-hole
(DH) algorithm to remove stellar speckles on-sky before a science observation.
It uses a pair-wise probing estimator and a controller based on electric field
conjugation. This work presents the first such on-sky minimization of speckles
with a DH technique on SPHERE. Results. We show the standard deviation of the
normalized intensity in the raw images is reduced by a factor of up to 5 in the
corrected region with respect to the current calibration strategy under median
conditions for VLT. This level of contrast performance obtained with only 1 min
of exposure time reaches median performances on SPHERE that use post-processing
methods requiring 1h-long sequences of observations. We also present an
alternative calibration method that takes advantage of the starlight coherence
and improves the post-processed contrast levels rms by a factor of about 3.
Conclusions. This on-sky demonstration represents a decisive milestone for the
future design, development, and observing strategy of the next generation of
ground-based exoplanet imagers for 10m to 40m telescope.

Real-world matrix completion is often a huge-scale optimization problem, with
$d$ so large that even the simplest full-dimension vector operations with
$O(d)$ time complexity become prohibitively expensive. Stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) is one of the few algorithms capable of solving matrix completion
on a huge scale, and can also naturally handle streaming data over an evolving
ground truth. Unfortunately, SGD experiences a dramatic slow-down when the
underlying ground truth is ill-conditioned; it requires at least
$O(\kappa\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations to get $\epsilon$-close to ground truth
matrix with condition number $\kappa$. In this paper, we propose a
preconditioned version of SGD that preserves all the favorable practical
qualities of SGD for huge-scale online optimization while also making it
agnostic to $\kappa$. For a symmetric ground truth and the Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) loss, we prove that the preconditioned SGD converges to
$\epsilon$-accuracy in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations, with a rapid linear
convergence rate as if the ground truth were perfectly conditioned with

multiple LIMMS can latch onto a single box and behave like a legged robotic

contrast with still limited research on a systematic comparison of performance
characteristics of these solutions. Such research is crucial for evaluating
fundamental trade-offs introduced by novel consensus protocols and their
implementations. These performance limitations are commonly analyzed with
ad-hoc benchmarking frameworks focused on the consensus algorithm of blockchain
systems. However, comparative evaluations of design choices require
macro-benchmarks for uniform and comprehensive performance evaluations of
blockchains at the system level rather than performance metrics of isolated
components. To address this research gap, we implement Gromit, a generic
framework for analyzing blockchain systems. Gromit treats each system under
test as a transaction fabric where clients issue transactions to validators. We
use Gromit to conduct the largest blockchain study to date, involving seven
representative systems with varying consensus models. We determine the peak
performance of these systems with a synthetic workload in terms of transaction
throughput and scalability and show that transaction throughput does not scale
with the number of validators. We explore how robust the subjected systems are
against network delays and reveal that the performance of permissoned
blockchain is highly sensitive to network conditions.

various electronic properties and phenomena. Computational methods capable of

complementing the experimental results and for extracting valuable insights
therefrom. In particular, a recently proposed first-principles approach titled
Many-Body XAS (MBXAS), which approximates the final (initial) state as a Slater
determinant constructed from Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals optimized in absence
(presence) of the relevant core-hole has shown promising prospects in
evaluating the transition amplitudes. In this article, we show that the MBXAS
approach can be rederived using a transition operator expressed entirely in the
basis of core-excited state KS orbitals and that this reformulation offers
substantial practical and conceptual advantages. In addition to circumventing
previous issues of convergence with respect to the number of unoccupied
ground-state orbitals, the aforementioned representation reduces the
computational expense by rendering the calculation of such orbitals unnecessary
altogether. The reformulated approach also provides a direct pathway for
comparing the many-body approximation with the so-called single-particle
treatment and indicates the relative importance in observed XAS intensity of
the relaxation of the valence occupied subspace induced by the core excitation.
Finally, using the core-excited state basis, we define auxiliary orbitals for
x-ray absorption and demonstrate their utility in explaining the spectral
intensity by contrasting them with single-particle approximations to the

flexibility and ease of implementation, traditional evolutionary algorithms
(EAs) are applied to deal with a small part of experimental optimization design
problems without mathematical derivation and assumption. However, the current
EAs remain the issues of determining the support point number, handling the
infeasible weight solution, and the insufficient experiment. To address the
above issues, this paper investigates differential evolution (DE) variants for
finding D- and A-optimal designs on several different statistical models. The
repair operation is proposed to automatically determine the support point by
combining similar support points with their corresponding weights based on
Euclidean distance and deleting the support point with less weight.
Furthermore, the repair operation fixes the infeasible weight solution into the
feasible weight solution. To enrich our optimal design experiments, we utilize
the proposed DE variants to test the D- and A-optimal design problems on 12

and reduce the computational time of indirect low thrust trajectory
optimization when solving fuel- and time-optimal problems. For solving fuel
optimal (FO) problems, a positive scaling factor -- $\Gamma_{TR}$ -- is
introduced based on the energy optimal (EO) solution to establish a convenient
profile for the switching function of the FO problem. This negates the need for
random guesses to initialize the indirect optimization process. Similarly,
another scaling factor-$\beta$-, is introduced when solving the time-optimal
(TO) problem to connect the EO problem to the TO. The developed methodology for
the TO problem was crucial for the GTOC11 competition. Case studies are
conducted to validate the solution process in both TO and FO problems. For
geocentric cases, the effect of eclipses and $J_2$ perturbations were also
considered. The examples show that EO can provide a good guess for TO and FO
problems and that introducing the constants can reduce the initial residuals
and improve convergence. It is also shown that the equation for the Lagrangian
multiplier of mass and the associated boundary condition can be ignored for

and accelerate software development process. Current code search methods can be
divided into two categories: traditional information retrieval (IR) based and
deep learning (DL) based approaches. DL-based approaches include the
cross-encoder paradigm and the bi-encoder paradigm. However, both approaches
have certain limitations. The inference of IR-based and bi-encoder models are
fast, however, they are not accurate enough; while cross-encoder models can
achieve higher search accuracy but consume more time. In this work, we propose
TOSS, a two-stage fusion code search framework that can combine the advantages
of different code search methods. TOSS first uses IR-based and bi-encoder
models to efficiently recall a small number of top-k code candidates, and then
uses fine-grained cross-encoders for finer ranking. Furthermore, we conduct
extensive experiments on different code candidate volumes and multiple
programming languages to verify the effectiveness of TOSS. We also compare TOSS
with six data fusion methods. Experimental results show that TOSS is not only
efficient, but also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with an overall mean
reciprocal ranking (MRR) score of 0.763, compared to the best baseline result
on the CodeSearchNet benchmark of 0.713.

considerable attention in recent years. The majority of pioneering works have
dealt with inferring the topology from abundant observations of NDSs, so as to
approximate the real one asymptotically. Leveraging the characteristic that
NDSs will react to various disturbances and the disturbance's influence will
consistently spread, this paper focuses on inferring the topology by a few
active excitations. The key challenge is to distinguish different influences of
system noises and excitations from the exhibited state deviations, where the
influences will decay with time and the exciatation cannot be arbitrarily
large. To practice, we propose a one-shot excitation based inference method to
infer $h$-hop neighbors of a node. The excitation conditions for accurate
one-hop neighbor inference are first derived with probability guarantees. Then,
we extend the results to $h$-hop neighbor inference and multiple excitations
cases, providing the explicit relationships between the inference accuracy and
excitation magnitude. Specifically, the excitation based inference method is
not only suitable for scenarios where abundant observations are unavailable,
but also can be leveraged as auxiliary means to improve the accuracy of
existing methods. Simulations are conducted to verify the analytical results.

Federated learning (FL) can use decentralized data to train models while
keeping data local. Existing FL methods assume all the data have labels.
However, medical data often comes without full labels due to high labeling
costs. Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, contrastive learning (CL) and
masked autoencoders (MAE), can leverage the unlabeled data to pre-train models,
followed by fine-tuning with limited labels. However, combining SSL and FL has
unique challenges. For example, CL requires diverse data but each device only
has limited data. For MAE, while Vision Transformer (ViT) based MAE has higher
accuracy over CNNs in centralized learning, MAE's performance in FL with
unlabeled data has not been investigated. Besides, the ViT synchronization
between the server and clients is different from traditional CNNs. Therefore,
special synchronization methods need to be designed. In this work, we propose
two federated self-supervised learning frameworks for dermatological disease
diagnosis with limited labels. The first one features lower computation costs,
suitable for mobile devices. The second one features high accuracy and fits
high-performance servers. Based on CL, we proposed federated contrastive
learning with feature sharing (FedCLF). Features are shared for diverse
contrastive information without sharing raw data for privacy. Based on MAE, we
proposed FedMAE. Knowledge split separates the global and local knowledge
learned from each client. Only global knowledge is aggregated for higher
generalization performance. Experiments on dermatological disease datasets show
superior accuracy of the proposed frameworks over state-of-the-arts.

joint aspect-sentiment analysis, which first extract aspects (aspect
extraction) by detecting aspect boundaries and then classify the span-level
sentiments (sentiment classification). However, most existing approaches either
sequentially extract task-specific features, leading to insufficient feature
interactions, or they encode aspect features and sentiment features in a
parallel manner, implying that feature representation in each task is largely
independent of each other except for input sharing. Both of them ignore the
internal correlations between the aspect extraction and sentiment
classification. To solve this problem, we novelly propose a hierarchical
interactive network (HI-ASA) to model two-way interactions between two tasks
appropriately, where the hierarchical interactions involve two steps:
shallow-level interaction and deep-level interaction. First, we utilize
cross-stitch mechanism to combine the different task-specific features
selectively as the input to ensure proper two-way interactions. Second, the
mutual information technique is applied to mutually constrain learning between
two tasks in the output layer, thus the aspect input and the sentiment input
are capable of encoding features of the other task via backpropagation.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate HI-ASA's
superiority over baselines.

degradation to image quality by introducing blur and geometric distortion. In
recent years, various deep learning-based single image atmospheric turbulence
mitigation methods, including CNN-based and GAN inversion-based, have been

effects from boundaries on the real space expressions of OM. The size
convergence processes of its three constituent terms $M_{\mathrm{LC}}$,
$M_{\mathrm{IC}}$, $M_{\mathrm{BC}}$ are analysed. The topological term
$M_{\mathrm{BC}}$ makes a nonnegligible contribution from boundaries as a
manifestation of edge states, especially in the case of nonzero Chern numbers.
However, we show that the influence of the boundary on $M_{\mathrm{LC}}$ and
$M_{\mathrm{IC}}$ exactly compensates that on $M_{\mathrm{BC}}$. This
compensation effect leads to the conclusion that the whole sample average is
also a correct algorithm in the thermodynamic limit, which gives the same value
as those from the bulk average and the $k$ space formula. This clarification
will be beneficial to further studies on orbitronics, as well as the orbital

reducing the magnitude of the overshoot of the numerical solution when it exits

Vlasov-Maxwell system. Using the Lorenz gauge condition, Maxwell's equations
for the electromagnetic fields are written as a collection of scalar and vector
wave equations. The use of potentials for the fields motivates the adoption of
a formulation for particles that is based on a generalized Hamiltonian. A
notable advantage offered by this generalized formulation is the elimination of
time derivatives of the potentials that are required in the standard
Newton-Lorenz treatment of particles. This allows the fields to retain the full
time-accuracy guaranteed by the field solver. The resulting updates for
particles require only knowledge of the fields and their spatial derivatives. A
method for constructing analytical spatial derivatives is presented that
exploits the underlying integral solution used in the field solver for the wave
equations. The field solvers considered in this work belong to a larger class
of methods which are unconditionally stable, can address geometry, and leverage
an $\mathcal{O}(N)$ fast summation method for efficiency, known as the Method
of Lines Transpose (MOL$^T$). A time-consistency property of the proposed field
solver for the vector potential form of Maxwell's equations is established,
which ensures that the semi-discrete form of the proposed method satisfies the
semi-discrete Lorenz gauge condition. We demonstrate the method on several

traversing between forward propagating waves in two layers. In the case of
generic ratios, there is a quantized conductance plateau originated from two
Chern numbers associated with two layers. However, the phase boundary of this
quantization plateau consists of a fractal transitional region (instead of a
clear transition line) of interpenetrating edge states (with quantized
conductance) and bulk states (with unquantized conductance). We attribute these
bulk states as mismatch induced in-gap bulk states. Different from in-gap
localized states induced by random disorder, these in-gap bulk states are
extended in the limit of vanishing random disorder. However, the detailed fine
structure of this transitional region is sensitive to disorder, lattice

channel studies, simulations, and model developments. However, they are
constructed under a constant electric field, causing them to have a low degree
of approximation in the prediction of ionic fluxes, electric currents, and
membrane potentials. In this paper, the equations are extended from the
constant electric field to the nonlinear electric field induced by charges from
an ionic solution and an ion channel protein. Furthermore, a novel numerical
quadrature scheme is developed to estimate one major parameter, called the
extension parameter, of the extended GHK equations in terms of a set of
electrostatic potential values. To this end, the extended GHK equations become
a bridge between the ""macroscopic"" ion channel kinetics and the ""microscopic""
electrostatic potential values across a cell membrane. To generate a set of
required electrostatic potential values, a nonlinear finite element iterative
scheme for solving a one-dimensional Poisson-Nernst-Planck ion channel model is
developed and implemented as a Python software package. This package is then
used to do numerical studies on the extended GHK equations, the numerical
quadrature scheme, and the nonlinear iterative scheme. Numerical results
confirm the importance of considering charge effects in the calculation of
ionic fluxes. They also validate the high numerical accuracy of the numerical
quadrature scheme, the fast convergence rate of the nonlinear iterative scheme,
and the high performance of the software package.

applications; however, it has also been deployed in practical applications in
more serious aspects of our lives, such as safety. To support people working in
dangerous industries, VR can ensure operators manipulate standardized tasks and
work collaboratively to deal with potential risks. Surprisingly, little
research has focused on how people can collaboratively work in VR environments.
Few studies have paid attention to the cognitive load of operators in their
collaborative tasks. Once task demands become complex, many researchers focus
on optimizing the design of the interaction interfaces to reduce the cognitive
load on the operator. That approach could be of merit; however, it can actually
subject operators to a more significant cognitive load and potentially more
errors and a failure of collaboration. In this paper, we propose a new
collaborative VR system to support two teleoperators working in the VR
environment to remote control an uncrewed ground vehicle. We use a compared
experiment to evaluate the collaborative VR systems, focusing on the time spent
on tasks and the total number of operations. Our results show that the total
number of processes and the cognitive load during operations were significantly
lower in the two-person group than in the single-person group. Our study sheds
light on designing VR systems to support collaborative work with respect to the
flow of work of teleoperators instead of simply optimizing the design outcomes.

smaller droplets, have long been desired for patterning thin-film structures.
The present study considers the inlet velocity of a liquid chamber located
upstream of a dispensing nozzle as a control variable and aims to optimize its
waveform using a sample-efficient Bayesian optimization algorithm. Firstly, the
droplet dispensing dynamics are numerically reproduced by using an open-source
OpenFOAM solver, interFoam, and the results are passed on to another code based
on pyFoam. Then, the parameters characterizing the actuation waveform driving a
DOD printer are determined by the Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm so as to
maximize a prescribed multi-objective function expressed as the sum of two
factors, i.e., the size of a primary droplet and the presence of satellite
droplets. The results show that the present BO algorithm can successfully find
high-precision dispensing waveforms within 150 simulations. Specifically,
satellite droplets can be effectively eliminated and the droplet diameter can
be significantly reduced to 24.9% of the nozzle diameter by applying the
optimal waveform.

Markov chain Monte Carlo typically requires one to evaluate the model thousands

Bayesian model fitting becomes infeasible. To remedy this, a second statistical
model that predicts the simulation output -- an ""emulator"" -- can be used in
lieu of the full simulation during model fitting. A typical emulator of choice
is the Gaussian process (GP), a flexible, non-linear model that provides both a
predictive mean and variance at each input point. Gaussian process regression
works well for small amounts of training data ($n < 10^3$), but becomes slow to
train and use for prediction when the data set size becomes large. Various
methods can be used to speed up the Gaussian process in the medium-to-large
data set regime ($n > 10^5$), trading away predictive accuracy for drastically
reduced runtime. This work examines the accuracy-runtime trade-off of several
approximate Gaussian process models -- the sparse variational GP, stochastic
variational GP, and deep kernel learned GP -- when emulating the predictions of
density functional theory (DFT) models. Additionally, we use the emulators to
calibrate, in a Bayesian manner, the DFT model parameters using observed data,
resolving the computational barrier imposed by the data set size, and compare
calibration results to previous work. The utility of these calibrated DFT
models is to make predictions, based on observed data, about the properties of
experimentally unobserved nuclides of interest e.g. super-heavy nuclei.

novel video understanding task, namely video outline generation (VOG). This
task is defined to contain two sub-tasks: (1) first segmenting the video
according to the content structure and then (2) generating a heading for each
segment. To learn and evaluate VOG, we annotate a 10k+ dataset, called DuVOG.
Specifically, we use OCR tools to recognize subtitles of videos. Then
annotators are asked to divide subtitles into chapters and title each chapter.
In videos, highlighted text tends to be the headline since it is more likely to
attract attention. Therefore we propose a Visual Subtitle feature Enhanced
video outline generation model (VSENet) which takes as input the textual
subtitles together with their visual font sizes and positions. We consider the
VOG task as a sequence tagging problem that extracts spans where the headings
are located and then rewrites them to form the final outlines. Furthermore,
based on the similarity between video outlines and textual outlines, we use a
large number of articles with chapter headings to pretrain our model.
Experiments on DuVOG show that our model largely outperforms other baseline
methods, achieving 77.1 of F1-score for the video segmentation level and 85.0
of ROUGE-L_F0.5 for the headline generation level.

established to be appropriate for many quantum systems. For these ensemble the
two point correlation function is not yet derived though these ensembles are
introduced 50 years back. Two-point correlation function in eigenvalues of a
random matrix ensemble is the ensemble average of the product of the density of
eigenvalues at two eigenvalues say $E$ and $E^\prime$. Fluctuation measures
such as the number variance and Dyson-Mehta $\Delta_3$ statistic are defined by
the two-point function and so also the variance of the level motion in the
ensemble. Recently, it is recognized that for the embedded ensembles with
$k$-body interactions the one-point function (ensemble averaged density of
eigenvalues) follows the so called $q$-normal distribution. With this, the
eigenvalue density can be expanded by starting with the $q$-normal form and
using the associated $q$-Hermite polynomials $He_\zeta(x|q)$. Covariances
$\overline{S_\zeta S_{\zeta^\prime}}$ (overline representing ensemble average)
of the expansion coefficients $S_\zeta$ with $\zeta \ge 1$ here determine the
two-point function as they are a linear combination of the bivariate moments
$\Sigma_{PQ}$ of the two-point function. Besides describing all these, in this
paper derived are formulas for the bivariate moments $\Sigma_{PQ}$ with $P+Q
\le 8$, of the two-point correlation function, for the embedded Gaussian
unitary ensembles with $k$-body interactions [EGUE($k$)] as appropriate for
systems with $m$ fermions in $N$ single particle states. Used for obtaining the
formulas is the $SU(N)$ Wigner-Racah algebra. These formulas with finite $N$
corrections are used to derive formulas for the covariances $\overline{S_\zeta
S_{\zeta^\prime}}$ in the asymptotic limit.

outstanding performance in generating high-resolution (HR) images from

superiority using synthetically generated LR images, and their generalizability
to real-world images is often not satisfactory. In this paper, we pay attention
to two well-known strategies developed for robust super-resolution (SR), i.e.,
reference-based SR (RefSR) and zero-shot SR (ZSSR), and propose an integrated
solution, called reference-based zero-shot SR (RZSR). Following the principle
of ZSSR, we train an image-specific SR network at test time using training
samples extracted only from the input image itself. To advance ZSSR, we obtain
reference image patches with rich textures and high-frequency details which are
also extracted only from the input image using cross-scale matching. To this
end, we construct an internal reference dataset and retrieve reference image
patches from the dataset using depth information. Using LR patches and their
corresponding HR reference patches, we train a RefSR network that is embodied
with a non-local attention module. Experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed RZSR compared to the previous ZSSR methods and
robustness to unseen images compared to other fully supervised SISR methods.

Existing fairness testing approaches are mostly designed for identifying

another widely concerning type of discrimination, testing against group
discrimination, mostly hidden, is much less studied. To address the gap, in
this work, we propose TESTSGD, an interpretable testing approach which
systematically identifies and measures hidden (which we call `subtle' group

combinations of the sensitive features. Specifically, given a neural network,
TESTSGDfirst automatically generates an interpretable rule set which
categorizes the input space into two groups exposing the model's group
discrimination. Alongside, TESTSGDalso provides an estimated group fairness
score based on sampling the input space to measure the degree of the identified
subtle group discrimination, which is guaranteed to be accurate up to an error
bound. We evaluate TESTSGDon multiple neural network models trained on popular
datasets including both structured data and text data. The experiment results
show that TESTSGDis effective and efficient in identifying and measuring such
subtle group discrimination that has never been revealed before. Furthermore,
we show that the testing results of TESTSGDcan guide generation of new samples
to mitigate such discrimination through retraining with negligible accuracy

motion averaging (MA) algorithm has been extensively studied and many MA-based
algorithms have been introduced. They aim at recovering global motions from
relative motions and exploiting information redundancy to average accumulative
errors. However, one property of these methods is that they use Guass-Newton
method to solve a least squares problem for the increment of global motions,
which may lead to low efficiency and poor robustness to outliers. In this
paper, we propose a novel motion averaging framework for the multi-view
registration with Laplacian kernel-based maximum correntropy criterion (LMCC).
Utilizing the Lie algebra motion framework and the correntropy measure, we
propose a new cost function that takes all constraints supplied by relative
motions into account. Obtaining the increment used to correct the global
motions, can further be formulated as an optimization problem aimed at
maximizing the cost function. By virtue of the quadratic technique, the
optimization problem can be solved by dividing into two subproblems, i.e.,
computing the weight for each relative motion according to the current
residuals and solving a second-order cone program problem (SOCP) for the
increment in the next iteration. We also provide a novel strategy for
determining the kernel width which ensures that our method can efficiently
exploit information redundancy supplied by relative motions in the presence of
many outliers. Finally, we compare the proposed method with other MA-based
multi-view registration methods to verify its performance. Experimental tests
on synthetic and real data demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance in terms of efficiency, accuracy and robustness.

physical factors, such as rotation, metallicity, overshooting, and the initial
orbital period in binaries, significantly affect the Roche lobe overflow and
the formation of type IIb supernovae. It is found that binaries are the main
channel that capable of producing type typeIIb supernovae progenitors in the
mass range for initial masses below 20 $M_{\odot}$. The formation of type IIb
supernova progenitors is extremely sensitive to the initial orbital period. A
less massive hydrogen indicates smaller radius and a higher effective
temperatures, and vice versa. Binary systems with initial periods between 300
and 720 days produce type IIb progenitors that are a red supergiant. Those with
an initial period between 50 and 300 days produce yellow supergiant progenitors
and those with initial periods shorter than 50 days, blue supergiant
progenitors. Both rapid rotation and larger overshooting can enlarge the
carbon-oxygen core mass and lead to higher core temperature and lower central
density at the pre-collapse phase. They are also beneficial to surface nitrogen
enrichment but restrict the efficiency of the first dredge-up. SN IIb
progenitors with low metallicity have smaller hydrogen envelope masses and
radii than the high metallicity counterparts. Ultra-stripped binary models have
systematically higher core mass fraction $\rm ^{12}C$ left, which has important

satisfiability problem (Sat) have been improving for decades. Among the
reasons, why these solvers are so fast, is the implicit usage of the formula's
structural properties during solving. One of such structural indicators is the
so-called treewidth, which tries to measure how close a formula instance is to
being easy (tree-like). This work focuses on logic-based problems and
treewidth-based methods and tools for solving them. Many of these problems are
also relevant for knowledge representation and reasoning (KR) as well as
artificial intelligence (AI) in general. We present a new type of problem
reduction, which is referred to by decomposition-guided (DG). This reduction
type forms the basis to solve a problem for quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs)
of bounded treewidth that has been open since 2004. The solution of this
problem then gives rise to a new methodology for proving precise lower bounds
for a range of further formalisms in logic, KR, and AI. Despite the established
lower bounds, we implement an algorithm for solving extensions of Sat
efficiently, by directly using treewidth. Our implementation is based on
finding abstractions of instances, which are then incrementally refined in the
process. Thereby, our observations confirm that treewidth is an important
measure that should be considered in the design of modern solvers.

e.g. mmWave and sub-terahertz (subTHz) systems.
  This makes localization and channel estimation in the near field of the

  In this paper, we consider the spherical wavefront propagation in the near

  A near-field channel estimation and localization (NF-JCEL) algorithm is
proposed based on the derived second-order Fresnel approximation of the

  To be specific, we first decouple the user equipment (UE) distances and
angles of arrival (AoAs) through a down-sampled Toeplitz covariance matrix, so
that the vertical and azimuth AoAs in the array steering vectors can be
estimated separately with low complexities.
  Then, the UE distance can be estimated by the simple one-dimensional search,
and the channel attenuation coefficients are obtained through the orthogonal
matching pursuit (OMP) method.
  Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed NF-JCEL algorithm
to the conventional far-field algorithm, and show that higher resolution

examples. Specifically, we introduce a memory bank module that stores the
historical predictions of each example and dynamically updates to support the
selection for the subsequent learning iteration. Besides, to reduce the
accumulated error of the sample selection bias of SFT, we devise a
regularization term to penalize the confident output distribution. By
increasing the weight of the misclassified categories with this term, the loss
function is robust to label noise in mild conditions. We conduct extensive
experiments on three benchmarks with variant noise types and achieve the new
state-of-the-art. Ablation studies and further analysis verify the virtue of
SFT for sample selection in robust learning.

that enables efficient use of multi-scale features in Transformer-based object

few crucial locations, and it is achieved with two novel designs. First, IMFA
rearranges the Transformer encoder-decoder pipeline so that the encoded

IMFA sparsely samples scale-adaptive features for refined detection from just a
few keypoint locations under the guidance of prior detection predictions. As a
result, the sampled multi-scale features are sparse yet still highly beneficial
for object detection. Extensive experiments show that the proposed IMFA boosts
the performance of multiple Transformer-based object detectors significantly

potentially harmful consequences such as the introduction of bias towards

propose a novel PCA algorithm which tackles fairness issues by means of a
simple strategy comprising a one-dimensional search which exploits the
closed-form solution of PCA. As attested by numerical experiments, the proposal
can significantly improve fairness with a very small loss in the overall

Appropriate infinitesimal conditions are shown to be both necessary and
sufficient under mild conditions on the considered system and the specified
safe and unsafe regions. More precisely, for a robustly-safe system, we propose
a construction of a barrier function in terms of the time-to-impact function
with respect to a specifically constructed reachable set. Using techniques from
set-valued and nonsmooth analysis, we show that such a function, although being
only semicontinuous, certifies robust safety by verifying a non-infinitesimal
condition; namely, a condition involving the system's solutions. Furthermore,
we propose to refine the aforementioned construction, using integral techniques
available in the literature. As a result, we provide a necessary and sufficient
condition for robust safety that is infinitesimal; namely, it involves only the
barrier function and the system's right-hand side. In comparison to the
existing converse robust safety theorems, our result is more general as it
allows the safety region to be unbounded, the right-hand side to be a general
continuous set-valued map, and the solutions to be non-unique.

similarity between digital artifacts. An important use case of AM is the
reliable and efficient detection of case-relevant data structures on a
blacklist, if only fragments of the original are available. For instance, if
only a cluster of indexed malware is still present during the digital forensic
investigation, the AM algorithm shall be able to assign the fragment to the
blacklisted malware. However, traditional AM functions like TLSH and ssdeep
fail to detect files based on their fragments if the presented piece is
relatively small compared to the overall file size. A second well-known issue
with traditional AM algorithms is the lack of scaling due to the
ever-increasing lookup databases. We propose an improved matching algorithm
based on transformer models from the field of natural language processing. We
call our approach Deep Learning Approximate Matching (DLAM). As a concept from
artificial intelligence (AI), DLAM gets knowledge of characteristic blacklisted
patterns during its training phase. Then DLAM is able to detect the patterns in
a typically much larger file, that is DLAM focuses on the use case of fragment
detection. We reveal that DLAM has three key advantages compared to the
prominent conventional approaches TLSH and ssdeep. First, it makes the tedious
extraction of known to be bad parts obsolete, which is necessary until now
before any search for them with AM algorithms. This allows efficient
classification of files on a much larger scale, which is important due to
exponentially increasing data to be investigated. Second, depending on the use
case, DLAM achieves a similar or even significantly higher accuracy in
recovering fragments of blacklisted files. Third, we show that DLAM enables the
detection of file correlations in the output of TLSH and ssdeep even for small
fragment sizes.

chemical doping. In addition, structural and microstructural parameters, such

A major breakthrough in the field came with the fundamental understanding of
the link between the local electric and mechanical driving forces and domain

such data sets have become extremely abundant and are rapidly growing. In this
paper, instead of using a single reference string for the entire collection, we
investigate the use of different reference strings for subsets of the
collection, with the aim of improving compression. In particular, we form a
rooted tree (or hierarchy) on the strings and then compressed each string using
RLZ with parent as reference, storing only the root of the tree in plain text.
To decompress, we traverse the tree in BFS order starting at the root,
decompressing children with respect to their parent. We show that this approach
leads to a twofold improvement in compression on bacterial genome data sets,
with negligible effect on decompression time compared to the standard single
reference approach. We show that an effective hierarchy for a given set of
strings can be constructed by computing the optimal arborescence of a completed
weighted digraph of the strings, with weights as the number of phrases in the
RLZ parsing of the source and destination vertices. We further show that
instead of computing the complete graph, a sparse graph derived using locality
sensitive hashing can significantly reduce the cost of computing a good
hierarchy, without adversely effecting compression performance.

in a channel where the upper wall contains divots of one depth and the lower
wall contains divots of a different depth. Under an applied driving force,
skyrmions in the channels move with a finite skyrmion Hall angle that deflects
them toward the upper wall for $-x$ direction driving and the lower wall for
$+x$ direction driving. When the upper divots have zero height, the skyrmions
are deflected against the flat upper wall for $-x$ direction driving and the
skyrmion velocity depends linearly on the drive. For $+x$ direction driving,
the skyrmions are pushed against the lower divots and become trapped, giving
reduced velocities and a nonlinear velocity-force response. When there are
shallow divots on the upper wall and deep divots on the lower wall, skyrmions
get trapped for both driving directions; however, due to the divot depth
difference, skyrmions move more easily under $-x$ direction driving, and become
strongly trapped for $+x$ direction driving. The preferred $-x$ direction
motion produces what we call a Magnus diode effect since it vanishes in the
limit of zero Magnus force, unlike the diode effects observed for asymmetric
sawtooth potentials. We show that the transport curves can exhibit a series of
jumps or dips, negative differential conductivity, and reentrant pinning due to
collective trapping events. We also discuss how our results relate to recent
continuum modeling on a similar skyrmion diode system.

computational approach for modeling the cosmic web. We demonstrate that such
algorithms are efficient in terms of computing time needed. We explore three
distinct spatial methods which we suitably adjust for (i) detecting the
topology of the cosmic web and (ii) categorizing various cosmic structures as
voids, walls, clusters and superclusters based on a variety of topological and
physical criteria such as the physical distance between objects, their masses
and local densities. The methods explored are (1) a new spatial method called
Gravity Lattice ; (2) a modified version of another spatial clustering
algorithm, the ABACUS; and (3) the well known spatial clustering algorithm
HDBSCAN. We utilize HDBSCAN in order to detect cosmic structures and categorize
them using their overdensity. We demonstrate that the ABACUS method can be
combined with the classic DTFE method to obtain similar results in terms of the
achieved accuracy with about an order of magnitude less computation time. To
further solidify our claims, we draw insights from the computer science domain
and compare the quality of the results with and without the application of our
method. Finally, we further extend our experiments and verify their
effectiveness by showing their ability to scale well with different cosmic web
structures that formed at different redshifts.

certain layers of the giant planets. Its radiation products may be the reason
for the red colour seen on Jupiter. Several ammonium salts, the products of NH3
and an acid, have previously been detected at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
The acid H2S is the fifth most abundant molecule in the coma of 67P followed by
NH3. In order to look for the salt NH4+SH-, we analysed in situ measurements
from the Rosetta/ROSINA Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer during the Rosetta
mission. NH3 and H2S appear to be independent of each other when sublimating
directly from the nucleus. However, we observe a strong correlation between the
two species during dust impacts, clearly pointing to the salt. We find that
NH4+SH- is by far the most abundant salt, more abundant in the dust impacts
than even water. We also find all previously detected ammonium salts and for
the first time ammonium fluoride. The amount of ammonia and acids balance each
other, confirming that ammonia is mostly in the form of salt embedded into dust
grains. Allotropes S2 and S3 are strongly enhanced in the impacts, while H2S2
and its fragment HS2 are not detected, which is most probably the result of
radiolysis of NH4+SH-. This makes a prestellar origin of the salt likely. Our
findings may explain the apparent depletion of nitrogen in comets and maybe
help to solve the riddle of the missing sulphur in star forming regions.

energy to photochemical reaction centers. Among the range of light harvesting
systems, PBS are considered to be excellent solutions for absorption
cross-sections but relatively inefficient energy transferring systems. This is
due to the combination of a large number of chromophores with intermediate
coupling distances. Nevertheless, PBS systems persisted from the origin of
oxygenic photosynthesis to present day cyanobacteria and red algae, organisms
that account for approximately half of the primary productivity in the ocean.
In this study we modeled energy transfer through subsets of PBS structures,
using a comprehensive dynamic Hamiltonian model. Our approach was applied,
initially, to pairs of phycobilin hexamers and then extended to short rods. By
manipulating the distances and angles between the structures we could probe the
dynamics of exciton transfer. These simulations suggest that the PBS
chromophore network enhances energy distribution over the entire PBS structure,
both horizontally and vertically to the rod axis. Furthermore, energy transfer
was found to be relatively immune to the effects of distances or rotations,
within the range of intermediate coupling distances. Therefore, we suggest that
the PBS provides unique advantages and flexibility to aquatic photosynthesis.

employ a coarse-to-fine multi-scale reconstruction approach to cope with the

worst-case delay bounds were obtained by combining Total Flow Analysis (TFA)
with the strict service curve characterization of DRR by Tabatabaee et al. The
latter is the best-known single server analysis of DRR, however the former is
dominated by Polynomial-size Linear Programming (PLP), which improves the TFA
bounds and stability region, but was never applied to DRR networks. We first
perform the necessary adaptation of PLP to DRR by computing burstiness bounds
per-class and per-output aggregate and by enabling PLP to support non-convex
service curves. Second, we extend the methodology to support networks with
cyclic dependencies: This raises further dependency loops, as, on one hand, DRR
strict service curves rely on traffic characteristics inside the network, which
comes as output of the network analysis, and on the other hand, TFA or PLP
requires prior knowledge of the DRR service curves. This can be solved by
iterative methods, however PLP itself requires making cuts, which imposes other
levels of iteration, and it is not clear how to combine them. We propose a
generic method, called PLP-DRR, for combining all the iterations sequentially
or in parallel. We show that the obtained bounds are always valid even before
convergence; furthermore, at convergence, the bounds are the same regardless of
how the iterations are combined. This provides the best-known worst-case bounds
for time-sensitive networks, with general topology, with DRR. We apply the
method to an industrial network, where we find significant improvements

approximation, where solutions of the VI are estimated with solutions of a
sample average VI that uses empirical estimates of the CVaRs. We establish two
properties for this scheme. First, under continuity of the random map and the
uncertainty taking values in a bounded set, we prove asymptotic consistency,
establishing almost sure convergence of the solution of the sample average
problem to the true solution. Second, under the additional assumption of random
functions being Lipschitz, we prove exponential convergence where the
probability of the distance between an approximate solution and the true
solution being smaller than any constant approaches unity exponentially fast.
The exponential decay bound is refined for the case where random functions have
a specific separable form in the decision variable and uncertainty. We adapt
these results to the case of uncertain routing games and derive explicit sample
guarantees for obtaining a CVaR-based Wardrop equilibria using the sample
average procedure. We illustrate our theoretical findings by approximating the

existence of such crossings gives rise to low energy properties akin to a Weyl

these crossings to exist, either time-reversal or inversion symmetry or

namely empty intersection with a geodesic ball of the prescribed volume.
Although we do not prove that this last inclusion result is sharp, for a mass
less than the half of the sphere, we numerically identify a density with higher
first eigenvalue than the corresponding geodesic ball and with support equal to
the full sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$.

correlated electron systems. Here, we study how such ubiquitous plasmons leave
their marks on the electron dispersion in cuprates. In contrast to phonons and
magnetic fluctuations, plasmons do not yield a kink in the electron dispersion.
Instead, we find that the optical plasmon accounts for an emergent band --
plasmarons -- in the one-particle excitation spectrum; acoustic-like plasmons
typical to a layered system are far less effective. Because of strong electron
correlations, the plasmarons are generated by bosonic fluctuations associated
with the local constraint, not by the usual charge-density fluctuations,
although both equally describe plasmons. Apart from this physical mechanism, a
mathematical structure to host the plasmarons is similar to a weak coupling
scheme discussed in alkali metals, Bi, graphene, monolayer transition-metal
dichalcogenides, semiconductors, diamond, two-dimensional electron systems, and
SrIrO3 films, establishing a concept of plasmarons in metallic systems in
general. Plasmarons are realized below (above) the quasiparticle band in
electron-doped (hole-doped) cuprates, including a region around (pi,0) and

stabilisation relies on the gradient or solution discontinuity at element

scheme. This diffusion acts as an implicit subgrid model and stablises
under-resolved turbulent simulations.
  This paper investigates the effect of jump penalty stabilisation methods
(penalising gradient or solution) for stabilisation and improvement of
high-order discontinuous Galerkin schemes in turbulent regime. We analyse these
schemes using an eigensolution analysis, a 1D non-linear Burgers equation
(mimicking a turbulent cascade) and 3D turbulent Navier-Stokes simulations
(Taylor-Green Vortex problem).
  We show that the two jump penalty stabilisation techniques can stabilise
under-resolved simulations thanks to the improved dispersion-dissipation
characteristics (when compared to non-penalised schemes) and provide accurate
results for turbulent flows. The numerical results indicate that the proposed
jump penalty stabilise under-resolved simulations and improve the simulations,

individual absorption lines and cross-correlation techniques. These results are
compared to literature studies on UHJs characterised to date. With CORALIE and
EulerCam observations, we updated the mass of MASCARA-4 b (1.675 +/- 0.241
Jupiter masses) as well as other system and planet parameters. In the
transmission spectrum derived from ESPRESSO observations, we resolve excess
absorption by H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, Na D1 & D2, Ca+ H & K, and a few strong
individual lines of Mg, Fe and Fe+. We also present the cross-correlation
detection of Mg, Ca, Cr, Fe and Fe+. The absorption strength of Fe+
significantly exceeds the prediction from a hydrostatic atmospheric model, as
commonly observed in other UHJs. We attribute this to the presence of Fe+ in
the exosphere due to hydrodynamic outflows. This is further supported by the
positive correlation of absorption strengths of Fe+ with the H$\alpha$ line.
Comparing transmission signatures of various species in the UHJ population
allows us to disentangle the hydrostatic regime (as traced via the absorption
by Mg and Fe) from the exospheres (as probed by H$\alpha$ and Fe+) of the
strongly irradiated atmospheres.

with two model predictive controllers (MPCs), namely reference-tracking MPC and
car-following MPC, that use the information from onboard sensors, signal phase
and timing (SPaT) messages from traffic light infrastructure, and geographical
information of the driving route to compute an energy-optimal driving speed. An
optimal speed suggestion and informative advice are indicated to the driver
using a visual feedback. pEDAS provides continuous feedback and encourages the
drivers to perform energy-efficient car-following while tracking a preceding
vehicle, travel at safe speeds at turns and curved roads, drive at
energy-optimal speed determined using dynamic programming in freeway scenarios,
and travel with a green-wave optimal speed to cross the signalized
intersections at a green phase whenever possible. Furthermore, to evaluate the
efficacy of the proposed pEDAS, user studies were conducted with 41
participants on a dynamic driving simulator. The objective analysis revealed
that the drivers achieved mean energy savings up to 10%, reduced the speed
limit violations, and avoided unnecessary stops at signalized intersections by
using pEDAS. Finally, the user acceptance of the proposed pEDAS was evaluated
using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Theory of Planned Behavior

perceived usefulness and perceived behavioral control were found to be the
significant factors in influencing the behavioral intention to use pEDAS.

regular lattices and linear coupling. Depending on the coupling constant, K,
and the propensity to choose an opinion (the probability to manifest a given

even in infinity systems (K greater than or equal to K_c), regions where
not-consensus is the only steady state (K lesser than K_c), and a region where
consensus on any opinion is transitory with each agent presenting periods of
strong oscillation of opinions before changing polarization (p_0 equal to p_c

chaos, which is softened increasing the chemical potential or the magnetic

  Near-Epoch Dependence",,,,,"math.ST stat.ME stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The major contributions of this paper lie in two aspects. Firstly, we focus
on deriving Bernstein-type inequalities for both geometric and algebraic
irregularly-spaced NED random fields, which contain time series as special
case. Furthermore, by introducing the idea of ""effective dimension"" to the
index set of random field, our results reflect that the sharpness of
inequalities are only associated with this ""effective dimension"". Up to the
best of our knowledge, our paper may be the first one reflecting this
phenomenon. Hence, the first contribution of this paper can be more or less
regarded as an update of the pioneering work from \citeA{xu2018sieve}.
Additionally, as a corollary of our first contribution, a Bernstein-type
inequality for geometric irregularly-spaced $\alpha$-mixing random fields is
also obtained. The second aspect of our contributions is that, based on the
inequalities mentioned above, we show the $L_{\infty}$ convergence rate of the
many interesting kernel-based nonparametric estimators. To do this, two
deviation inequalities for the supreme of empirical process are derived under
NED and $\alpha$-mixing conditions respectively. Then, for irregularly-spaced
NED random fields, we prove the attainability of optimal rate for local linear
estimator of nonparametric regression, which refreshes another pioneering work
on this topic, \citeA{jenish2012nonparametric}. Subsequently, we analyze the
uniform convergence rate of uni-modal regression under the same NED conditions
as well. Furthermore, by following the guide of \citeA{rigollet2009optimal}, we
also prove that the kernel-based plug-in density level set estimator could be
optimal up to a logarithm factor. Meanwhile, when the data is collected from
$\alpha$-mixing random fields, we also derive the uniform convergence rate of a
simple local polynomial density estimator \cite{cattaneo2020simple}.

applications, such as home robots and medical diagnoses. However, one
significant challenge is to design a robust learning method for various client
tasks. One critical aspect is to ensure privacy, as client data sharing is
limited due to confidentiality concerns. This work focuses on addressing the
issue of confidentiality constraints in multi-client VQA tasks and limited
labeled training data of clients. We propose the Unidirectional Split Learning
with Contrastive Loss (UniCon) method to overcome these limitations. The
proposed method trains a global model on the entire data distribution of
different clients, learning refined cross-modal representations through model
sharing. Privacy is ensured by utilizing a split learning architecture in which
a complete model is partitioned into two components for independent training.
Moreover, recent self-supervised learning techniques were found to be highly
compatible with split learning. This combination allows for rapid learning of a
classification task without labeled data. Furthermore, UniCon integrates
knowledge from various local tasks, improving knowledge sharing efficiency.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted on the VQA-v2 dataset using five
state-of-the-art VQA models, demonstrating the effectiveness of UniCon. The
best-performing model achieved a competitive accuracy of 49.89%. UniCon
provides a promising solution to tackle VQA tasks in a distributed data silo
setting while preserving client privacy.

reddenings of NGC 5548. We investigate two possible reddening curves considered
for active galactic nuclei (AGNs): the mean AGN reddening curve of Gaskell &
Benker (2007) which is relatively flat in the ultraviolet, and a curve that
rises strongly into the ultraviolet like a Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)
reddening curve. We also consider a standard Milky Way curve. Regardless of the
curve adopted, we find a total reddening ~14 times greater than the small
amount of reddening due to dust in the solar neighbourhood. The UV-to-optical
ratios rule out a steep SMC-like reddening curve for NGC 5548. The Milky Way
and Gaskell & Benker curves give a mean reddening of E(B-V) = 0.25 +/- 0.02.
The four non-hydrogen-line reddening indicators imply that the intrinsic
hydrogen line ratios are consistent with Baker-Menzel case B values. The
unreddened optical-to-UV spectral energy distribution is consistent with the
predicted distribution for an externally-illuminated accretion disc. The
reddening we derive for NGC 5548 is typical of previous estimates for type-1
AGNs. Neglecting internal extinction leads to an underestimate of the
luminosity at 1200 Angstroms by a factor of seven. The size scale of the
accretion disc has therefore been underestimated by a factor of ~2.6. This is
similar to the accretion disc size discrepancy found in the 2013 AGNSTORM
campaign and thus supports the proposal by Gaskell (2017) that the accretion
disc size discrepancy is primarily due to the neglect of reddening.

processes. Therefore, detecting fronts objectively from reanalyses is a
prerequisite for the long-term study of their weather impacts. For this
purpose, several algorithms exist, e.g., based on the thermic front parameter
(TFP) or the F diagnostic. It is shown that both methods have problems to
identify weak warm fronts since they are characterized by low baroclinicity. To
avoid this inaccuracy, a new algorithm is developed that considers fronts as
deviation from an adiabatic and steady state. These deviations can be
accurately measured using the dynamic state index (DSI). The DSI shows a
coherent dipole structure along fronts and is strongly correlated with
precipitation sums. It is shown that the North Atlantic storm tracks can be
clearly identified by the DSI method. Compared to other front identification
methods, fronts identified with the DSI method have particularly high specific
humidity. Using a simple estimate for front speed, it is shown that fronts
identified using DSI method move faster then fronts identified with TFP method,
demonstrating the potential of the DSI to indicate movement speed and direction

significant success, it uses either na{\i}ve position-based partitions or
static feature templates. These, however, hypothesize the pre-existence of the
parts in a given image or their positions, ignoring the input image-specific
information which limits their usability in challenging scenarios such as Re-ID

spatial attention-based Dynamic Part Template Initialization module that
dynamically generates part-templates using mid-level semantic features at the
earlier layers of the backbone. Following a self-attention layer, human
part-level features of the backbone are used to extract the templates of
diverse human body parts using a simplified cross-attention scheme which will
then be used to identify and collate representations of various human parts
from semantically rich features, increasing the discriminative ability of the
entire model. We further explore adaptive weighting of part descriptors to
quantify the absence or occlusion of local attributes and suppress the
contribution of the corresponding part descriptors to the matching criteria.
Extensive experiments on holistic, occluded, and partial Re-ID task benchmarks
demonstrate that our proposed architecture is able to achieve competitive
performance. Codes will be included in the supplementary material and will be

By way of illustration, we compare decentralized naming services and blockchain

extent they can be meaningfully differentiated, share similar potential as well
as challenges. Specifically, we refer to fears about non consensual

issuing an innocuous public scarlet letter to a DIDs associated public address

aspire to achieve composability with web3 smart contracts for correct execution
of code, privacy, coercion resistance, and censorship resistance. We offer
research paths for how VCs can also achieve these properties. We do not comment

formulate a conjecture in this direction. If proved, this conjecture implies

in state-of-the-art Transformer-based models. Most solutions to this problem
use specific architectures or training methods that do not generalize to other

results show that generating step-by-step rationales and introducing marker

language model to produce step-by-step rationales before outputting the answer
to effectively communicate the task to the model. However, as sequences become
longer, we find that current models struggle to keep track of token positions.
To address this issue, we interleave output tokens with markup tokens that act
as explicit positional and counting symbols. Our findings show how these two
complementary approaches enable remarkable sequence extrapolation and highlight
a limitation of current architectures to effectively generalize without

cognitive model accordingly. Inspired by this, we propose Q-Net, a
Query-informed Meta-FSS approach, which mimics in spirit the learning mechanism
of an expert clinician. We build Q-Net based on ADNet, a recently proposed
anomaly detection-inspired method. Specifically, we add two query-informed
computation modules into ADNet, namely a query-informed threshold adaptation
module and a query-informed prototype refinement module. Combining them with a
dual-path extension of the feature extraction module, Q-Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance on widely used abdominal and cardiac magnetic

signals that are emitted from neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) gas will be detected
by large-area radio surveys such as WALLABY and the SKA, and deliver galaxy
positions and velocities that can be used to measure galaxy clustering
statistics. But, to harness this information to improve our cosmological
understanding, and learn about the physics of dark matter and dark energy, we
need to accurately model the manner in which galaxies detected in HI trace the
underlying matter distribution of the Universe. For this purpose, we develop a
new HI-based Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model, which makes predictions
for the number of galaxies present in dark matter halos conditional on their HI
mass. The parameterised HOD model is fit and validated using the Dark Sage
semi-analytic model, where we show that the HOD parameters can be modelled by
simple linear and quadratic functions of HI mass. However, we also find that
the clustering predicted by the HOD depends sensitively on the radial
distributions of the HI galaxies within their host dark matter halos, which
does not follow the NFW profile in the Dark Sage simulation. As such, this work
enables -- for the first time -- a simple prescription for placing galaxies of
different HI mass within dark matter halos in a way that is able to reproduce
the HI mass-dependent galaxy clustering and HI mass function simultaneously and
without requiring knowledge of the optical properties of the galaxies. Further
efforts are required to demonstrate that this model can be used to produce
large ensembles of mock galaxy catalogues for upcoming surveys.

field in Schwarzschild spacetime background in the weak field approximation. To
calculate the deflection angle, we use Jacobi metric and Gauss-Bonnet theorem.
Since the corresponding Jacobi metric is a Finsler metric of Randers type, we
use both the osculating Riemannian metric method and generalized Jacobi metric
method. The deflection angle up to fourth order is obtained and the effect of
the magnetic field is discussed. It is found that the magnetic dipole will
increase (or decrease) the deflection angle of a positively charged signal when
its rotation angular momentum is parallel (or antiparallel) to the magnetic
field. It is argued that the difference in the deflection angles of different
rotation directions can be viewed as a Finslerian effect of the
non-reversibility of the Finsler metric. The similarity of the deflection angle
in this case with that for the Kerr spacetime allows us to directly use the
gravitational lensing results in the latter case. The dependence of the
apparent angles on the magnetic field suggests that by measuring these angles
the magnetic dipole might be constrained.

These studies report that as many as 20 to 30 minutes could be saved off a scan
that takes an hour or more. However, none of these studies have explored the
possibility of using masked image modeling (MIM) to predict the missing parts
of MRI k spaces. This study makes use of 11161 reconstructed MRI and k spaces
of knee MRI images from Facebook's fastmri dataset. This tests a modified
version of an existing model using baseline shifted window (Swin) and vision
transformer architectures that makes use of MIM on undersampled k spaces to
predict the full k space and consequently the full MRI image. Modifications
were made using pytorch and numpy libraries, and were published to a github
repository. After the model reconstructed the k space images, the basic Fourier
transform was applied to determine the actual MRI image. Once the model reached
a steady state, experimentation with hyperparameters helped to achieve pinpoint
accuracy for the reconstructed images. The model was evaluated through L1 loss,
gradient normalization, and structural similarity values. The model produced
reconstructed images with L1 loss values averaging to <0.01 and gradient
normalization values <0.1 after training finished. The reconstructed k spaces
yielded structural similarity values of over 99% for both training and
validation with the fully sampled k spaces, while validation loss continually
decreased under 0.01. These data strongly support the idea that the algorithm
works for MRI reconstruction, as they indicate the model's reconstructed image
aligns extremely well with the original, fully sampled k space.

promote the performance of face recognition. Specifically, we dynamically
select the non-overlapping subspace features in each batch during training, and
then use the subspace features to approximate full-feature among softmax-based

evaluated the device figures of merit (FOM), such as threshold voltage,
mobility, and trap density, during the whole measurement period. Short-term
changes in the FOM are mainly attributed to work function changes on the gate
electrode, whereas long-term changes are consistent with an increase in the
semiconductor trap density. The shift in threshold voltage and decrease in
mobility are found to be linear as a function of measurement cycles and caused
by electrical stress, with time immersed in water having a negligible effect on
the device. The trap density-of-states estimated using the subthreshold slope
is similar to earlier reported values for P3HT OFETs and exhibits a gradual
increase during device use and a partial recovery after rest, indicating the

the observation that the cluster amplitudes have difference in their relaxation
timescales with respect to the distributions of their magnitudes, the coupled

slow and fast relaxing modes, manifesting a dynamical hierarchical structure.
With the identification of the highly damped auxiliary amplitudes, their time
variation can be neglected compared to the principal amplitudes which take much
longer time to reach the fixed points. We analytically establish the adiabatic
approximation where each of these auxiliary amplitudes are expressed as unique
parametric functions of the collective principal amplitudes, allowing us to
study the optimization with the latter taken as the independent degrees of
freedom. Such decoupling of the amplitudes significantly reduces the
computational scaling without sacrificing the accuracy in the ground state
energy as demonstrated by a number of challenging molecular applications. A
road-map to treat higher order post-adiabatic effects is also discussed.

for certain lattice orientations of an idealized, body-centered cubic lattice,
and occurs generally in an amorphous or impure nuclear lattice. The pinning
force per unit length is $\sim 10^{16}$ dyn cm$^{-1}$ for a vortex-nucleus
interaction that is repulsive, and $\sim 10^{17}$ dyn cm$^{-1}$ for an
attractive interaction. The pinning force is strong enough to account for
observed spin jumps (glitches). Vortices forced through the lattice move with a
slip-stick character; for a range of superfluid velocities, the vortex can be
in either a cold, pinned state or a hot unpinned state, with strong excitation
of Kelvin waves on the vortex. This two-state nature of vortex motion sets the
stage for large-scale vortex movement that creates an observable spin glitch.
We argue that the vortex array is likely to become tangled as a result of
repeated unpinnings and repinnings. We conjecture that during a glitch, the
Kelvin-wave excitation spreads rapidly along the direction of the mean
superfluid vorticity and slower in the direction perpendicular to it, akin to
an anisotropic deflagration.

investigate spin evolution. However, decoherence remains a key challenge in
simulating coherent quantum dynamics. Here, we introduce quantum simulation

aims to reduce the compression cost while maintaining the original semantic
information. However, it is impractical to directly integrate the semantic
metric into the traditional codecs since they cannot be optimized in an
end-to-end manner. To solve this problem, some pioneering works have applied
reinforcement learning to implement image-wise semantic compression.
Nevertheless, video semantic compression has not been explored since its
complex reference architectures and compression modes. In this paper, we take a
step forward to video semantic compression and propose the Hierarchical
Reinforcement Learning based task-driven Video Semantic Coding, named as
HRLVSC. Specifically, to simplify the complex mode decision of video semantic
coding, we divided the action space into frame-level and CTU-level spaces in a
hierarchical manner, and then explore the best mode selection for them
progressively with the cooperation of frame-level and CTU-level agents.
Moreover, since the modes of video semantic coding will exponentially increase
with the number of frames in a Group of Pictures (GOP), we carefully
investigate the effects of different mode selections for video semantic coding
and design a simple but effective mode simplification strategy for it. We have
validated our HRLVSC on the video segmentation task with HEVC reference
software HM16.19. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that our HRLVSC
can achieve over 39% BD-rate saving for video semantic coding under the Low

detection models to consider various scales of an object. However, average
precision (AP) on small objects is relatively lower than AP on medium and large
objects. The reason is why the deeper layer of CNN causes information loss as
feature extraction level. We propose a new scale sequence (S^2) feature
extraction of FPN to strengthen feature information of small objects. We
consider FPN structure as scale-space and extract scale sequence (S^2) feature
by 3D convolution on the level axis of FPN. It is basically scale invariant
feature and is built on high-resolution pyramid feature map for small objects.
Furthermore, the proposed S^2 feature can be extended to most object detection
models based on FPN. We demonstrate the proposed S2 feature can improve the
performance of both one-stage and two-stage detectors on MS COCO dataset. Based
on the proposed S2 feature, we achieve upto 1.3% and 1.1% of AP improvement for
YOLOv4-P5 and YOLOv4-P6, respectively. For Faster RCNN and Mask R-CNN, we
observe upto 2.0% and 1.6% of AP improvement with the suggested S^2 feature,

adversely affect the grid operation and affect the system resilience due to
various factors like their intermittent availability, dynamics of weather

methodology to evaluate the planning and operational resilience of power
distribution systems under extreme events and determines the withstand

effectively employing the complex network theory. Correlated networks for
undesirable configurations are developed from the time series data of active

networks, computed the network parameters such as clustering coefficient,
assortative coefficient, average degree and power law exponent for the
anticipation; and percolation threshold for the determination of the network
withstand capability under extreme conditions. The proposed methodology is also
suitable for identifying the hosting capacity of solar panels in the system
while maintaining resilience under different unfavourable conditions and
identifying the most critical nodes of the system that could drive the system
into non-resilience. This framework is demonstrated on IEEE 123 node test
feeder by generating active power time-series data for a variety of electrical

resulted as an effective metric for the determination of the planning and
operational resilience of the power distribution system.

the performance of LASSO-ADMM algorithm. However, the optimization for the

solved yet. In order to optimize this regularization parameter, we propose an
efficient iterative adaptively regularized LASSO-ADMM (IAR-LASSO-ADMM)
algorithm by iteratively updating the regularization parameter in the
LASSO-ADMM algorithm. Moreover, a method is designed to iteratively update the
regularization parameter by adding an outer iteration to the LASSO-ADMM
algorithm. Specifically, at each outer iteration the zero support of the
estimate obtained by the inner LASSO-ADMM algorithm is utilized to estimate the
noise variance, and the noise variance is utilized to update the threshold
according to a pre-defined const false alarm rate (CFAR). Then, the resulting
threshold is utilized to update both the non-zero support of the estimate and
the regularization parameter, and proceed to the next inner iteration. In
addition, a suitable stopping criterion is designed to terminate the outer
iteration process to obtain the final non-zero support of the estimate of the
sparse measurement signals. The resulting algorithm is termed as
IAR-LASSO-ADMM-CFAR algorithm. Finally, simulation results have been presented
to show that the proposed IAR-LASSO-ADMM-CFAR algorithm outperforms the

location from the cylinder's center. Using the open-source Computational Fluid

conducted to determine the utility of the slit placement on the circular
cylinder and how it influences (positively/negatively) the harvester's
performance for a 1-degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) VIV system. The study shows that
the slit-cylinder displays the three-branch VIV response (i.e. initial branch
(IB), upper branch (UB), and lower branch (LB)). At a Reynolds number of 150,
the cylinder with no slit exhibits the two-branch VIV response (i.e. IB and LB)

acquired for such low Re flows. The results indicate that adding a normal slit
to the middle of the cylinder improves the alternating suction and blowing
phenomena. Offsetting it from the center towards the back stagnation point
suppresses the VIV and makes it unsuitable for energy harvesting applications.
While positioning the slit toward the front stagnation point improves
aerodynamic lift, and the cylinder sheds vortex closer to each other. It
enhances the amplitude of transverse oscillation and, consequently, the power
extraction. In addition, the peak energy transfer ratio for these scenarios is
comparable to that of the no-slit case but with a larger range of peak energy
transfer ratio values. It makes it suitable for energy harvesting applications.

disastrous consequences and are notoriously challenging to model, predict and
control. Here, we introduce a mean-field model of thermoacoustic transitions,
where the nonlinear flame response is modeled as the amplitude weighted
response of an ensemble of phase oscillators constrained to collectively evolve
at the rhythm of acoustic fluctuations. Starting from the acoustic wave
equation coupled with the phase oscillators, we derive the evolution equations
for the amplitude and phase and obtain the limit cycle solution. We show that
the model captures abrupt and continuous transition to thermoacoustic
instability observed in disparate combustors. We obtain quantitative insights
into the model by estimating the model parameters from the experimental data
using parameter optimisation. Importantly, our approach provides an explanation
of spatiotemporal synchronization and pattern-formation underlying the
transition to thermoacoustic instability while encapsulating the statistical
properties of desynchronization, chimeras, and global phase synchronization. We
further show using the model that continuous and abrupt transitions to limit
cycle oscillations in turbulent combustors corresponds to synchronization
transitions of \textit{second-order} and \textit{first-order}, respectively.
The present formulation provides a highly interpretable model of thermoacoustic
transitions: changes in empirical bifurcation parameters which lead to limit
cycle oscillations amounts to an increase in the coupling strength of the phase
oscillators, promoting global phase synchronization. The generality of the
model in capturing different types of transitions and states of
pattern-formation highlights the possibility of extending the present model to
a broad range of fluid-dynamical phenomena beyond thermoacoustics.

Networks (DNN) can be achieved using very large-scale models, consisting of
billions of parameters. Such models can only be run on dedicated servers,
typically provided by a 3rd party service, which leads to a substantial
monetary cost for every prediction. We propose a new software architecture for
client-side applications, where a small local DNN is used alongside a remote
large-scale model, aiming to make easy predictions locally at negligible
monetary cost, while still leveraging the benefits of a large model for
challenging inputs. In a proof of concept we reduce prediction cost by up to
50% without negatively impacting system accuracy.

vision-language models. However, further improving these models require
additional labelled data which is a huge manual effort. In this paper, we
propose a framework MKTVR, that utilizes knowledge transfer from a multilingual
model to boost the performance of video retrieval. We first use
state-of-the-art machine translation models to construct pseudo ground-truth
multilingual video-text pairs. We then use this data to learn a video-text
representation where English and non-English text queries are represented in a
common embedding space based on pretrained multilingual models. We evaluate our
proposed approach on four English video retrieval datasets such as MSRVTT,
MSVD, DiDeMo and Charades. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets outperforming previous
models. Finally, we also evaluate our model on a multilingual video-retrieval
dataset encompassing six languages and show that our model outperforms previous
multilingual video retrieval models in a zero-shot setting.

turbulent dilute methanol spray flames in vitiated coflow using the secondary
oxidizer Flamelet Generated Model (FGM). The modified FGM model uses an
additional secondary oxidizer parameter in addition to the three other
parameters previously used for spray flames progress variable, mixture
fraction, and enthalpy. The results for gas phase and droplet properties are
validated against the dilute methanol spray flame database for varying fuel
injection amounts. The droplet statistics and the lift-off flame heights are
accurately captured for all the cases. A proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)
of the scalar fluctuating hydroxyl radical (OH) field and velocity-temperature
field capture the flame structures in the downstream region of ignition
kernels. The detailed POD analysis reveals that the base frequency of the
dominant OH field equals that of the dominant vortical structure of 67.3 Hz.
The flame propagation happens around these dominant vortical structures because
of the less-strained fluid mixing.

Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) due to intentional and unintentional

significantly degrades the performance of a GNSS receiver. Several traditional
critical applications such as aviation, maritime and rail transport systems to
more recent applications such as autonomous vehicles, can be severely affected
by such undetected nor mitigated RFIs. Moreover, critical infrastructures such
as power supply and money transfer, are becoming more and more dependent on the
accurate timing information provided by GNSS. Thus, interference detection and
management techniques are crucial to be utilised in order to reduce
interference effects. This paper offers a state-of-the-art review of several
proposed methods for interference detection and mitigation with solutions
ranging from traditional to machine learning-based approaches. In addition, to
be able to characterise the RFI threats and develop mitigation techniques, it
is essential to monitor RFI systematically and share recorded data with
interested entities. Therefore, three GNSS threat monitoring systems are
briefly described. This White paper is a compilation of the seminar

of significant interest in science, engineering and industry. The major
processing speed bottlenecks in these platforms come from (a) an electronic

information compression implemented in native to incoming data optical domain
could mitigate both problems mentioned above by reducing the demand on data
throughput at the camera side and beyond. In this paper we present an optical
hashing and compression scheme that is based on SWIFFT - a post-quantum hashing
family of algorithms. High degree optical hardware-to-algorithm homomorphism
allows to optimally harvest well-understood potential of free-space processing:
innate parallelism, low latency tensor by-element multiplication and Fourier
transform. The algorithm can provide several orders of magnitude increase in
processing speed by replacing slow high-resolution CMOS cameras with ultra fast
and signal-triggered CMOS detector arrays. Additionally, the information
acquired in this way will require much lower transmission throughput, less
\emph{in silico} processing power, storage, and will be pre-hashed facilitating
cheap optical information security. This technology has a potential to allow
heterogeneous convolutional 4f classifiers get closer in performance to their
fully electronic counterparts.

excite a laminar boundary layer flow sufficiently to cause streamwise oriented

spanwise variations of the streamwise velocity. Downstream, the vortices
`wobble' through an inviscid secondary instability mechanism and, ultimately,
transition to turbulence. We formulate an optimal control algorithm to suppress
the growth rate of the streamwise vortex system. Considering a high Reynolds
number asymptotic framework, we reduce the full compressible Navier-Stokes
equations to the nonlinear compressible boundary region equations (NCBRE). We
then implement the method of Lagrange multipliers via an appropriate
transformation of the original constrained optimization problem into an
unconstrained form to obtain the disturbance equations in the form of the
adjoint compressible boundary region equations (ACBRE) and corresponding
optimality conditions. Numerical solutions of the ACBRE approach for
high-supersonic and hypersonic flows reveal a significant reduction in the
kinetic energy and wall shear stress for all considered configurations. We
present contour plots to demonstrate the qualitative effect of increased

instantaneous force and torque acting on a small spherical rigid particle
moving unsteadily in a general steady linear flow. This is achieved by using
matched asymptotic expansions and formulating the problem in a coordinate
system co-moving with the background flow. Effects of the fluid-velocity
gradients are assumed to be small, but to dominate over those of the velocity
difference between the body and fluid, which makes the results essentially
relevant to nearly neutrally buoyant particles. The outer solution (which at
first order is responsible for the Basset-Boussinesq history force at short
time and for shear-induced forces such as the Saffman lift force at long time)
is expressed via a flow-dependent tensorial kernel. The second-order inner
solution brings a number of different contributions to the force and torque.
Some are proportional to the relative translational or angular acceleration
between the particle and fluid, while others take the form of products of the
rotation/strain rate of the background flow and the relative translational or
angular velocity between the particle and fluid. Adding the outer and inner
contributions, the known added-mass force or the spin-induced lift force are
recovered, and new effects involving the rotation/strain rate of the background
flow are revealed. The resulting force and torque equations provide a rational
extension of the classical Basset-Boussinesq-Oseen equation incorporating all
first- and second-order fluid inertia effects resulting from both unsteadiness

received significant recent attention. Estimating fruit counts before harvest

has been made toward fruit detection, estimating the actual counts remains
challenging. In practice, fruits are often clustered together. Therefore,
methods that only detect fruits fail to offer general solutions to estimate
accurate fruit counts. Furthermore, in horticultural studies, rather than a
single yield estimate, finer information such as the distribution of the number
of apples per cluster is desirable. In this work, we formulate fruit counting
from images as a multi-class classification problem and solve it by training a
Convolutional Neural Network. We first evaluate the per-image accuracy of our
method and compare it with a state-of-the-art method based on Gaussian Mixture
Models over four test datasets. Even though the parameters of the Gaussian
Mixture Model-based method are specifically tuned for each dataset, our network
outperforms it in three out of four datasets with a maximum of 94\% accuracy.

Benjamini-Hochberg requires choosing the target FDP alpha before looking at the
data, but our method does not. For example, if using alpha=0.05 leads to no
discoveries, alpha can be increased to 0.1. We further provide mFDP-adjusted
p-values, which consequently also have a post hoc interpretation. The method
does not assume independence and was valid in all considered simulation
scenarios. The procedure is inspired by the popular estimator of the total
number of true hypotheses by Schweder, Spj{\o}tvoll and Storey. We adapt this
estimator to provide a median unbiased estimator of the FDP, first assuming
that a fixed rejection threshold is used. Taking this as a starting point, we
proceed to construct simultaneously median unbiased estimators of the FDP. This

many medical image segmentation tasks. Many of these are based on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). For such methods, the encoder is the key part for
global and local information extraction from input images; the extracted
features are then passed to the decoder for predicting the segmentations. In
contrast, several recent works show a superior performance with the use of
transformers, which can better model long-range spatial dependencies and
capture low-level details. However, transformer as sole encoder underperforms
for some tasks where it cannot efficiently replace the convolution based
encoder. In this paper, we propose a model with double encoders for 3D
biomedical image segmentation. Our model is a U-shaped CNN augmented with an
independent transformer encoder. We fuse the information from the convolutional
encoder and the transformer, and pass it to the decoder to obtain the results.
We evaluate our methods on three public datasets from three different
challenges: BTCV, MoDA and Decathlon. Compared to the state-of-the-art models
with and without transformers on each task, our proposed method obtains higher
Dice scores across the board.

Past attempts to extend this model to a multi-state MSR have proved unstable,

the two-state MSR with an adaptive moving average. A realistic trading

  Approach",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Car dependence has been threatening transportation sustainability as it
contributes to congestion and associated externalities. In response, various
transport policies that restrict the use of private vehicle have been
implemented. However, empirical evaluations of such policies have been limited.
To assess these policies' benefits and costs, it is imperative to accurately
evaluate how such policies affect traffic conditions. In this study, we compile
a refined spatio-temporal resolution data set of the floating-vehicle-based
traffic performance index to examine the effects of a recent nonlocal vehicle
driving restriction policy in Shanghai, one of most populous cities in the
world. Specifically, we explore whether and how the policy impacted traffic
speeds in the short term by employing a quasi-experimental
difference-in-differences modeling approach. We find that: (1) In the first
month, the policy led to an increase of the network-level traffic speed by
1.47% (0.352 km/h) during evening peak hours (17:00-19:00) but had no
significant effects during morning peak hours (7:00-9:00). (2) The policy also
helped improve the network-level traffic speed in some unrestricted hours
(6:00, 12:00, 14:00, and 20:00) although the impact was marginal. (3) The
short-term effects of the policy exhibited heterogeneity across traffic
analysis zones. The lower the metro station density, the greater the effects
were. We conclude that driving restrictions for non-local vehicles alone may
not significantly reduce congestion, and their effects can differ both
temporally and spatially. However, they can have potential side effects such as
increased purchase and usage of new energy vehicles, owners of which can obtain
a local license plate of Shanghai for free.

calibrate the classification outputs to the case of foveated images. Second, a
body-centered semantic map, encoding the objects classifications and
corresponding uncertainties, is sequentially updated with the calibrated

DNN-based AI workloads, wherein a DNN model is split into two parts, one of
which is executed on a mobile/client device and the other on an edge-server (or
cloud). Data compression is applied to the intermediate tensor from the DNN
that needs to be transmitted, addressing the challenge of optimizing the
rate-accuracy-complexity trade-off. Existing split-computing approaches adopt
ML-based data compression, but require that the parameters of either the entire
DNN model, or a significant portion of it, be retrained for different
compression levels. This incurs a high computational and storage burden:
training a full DNN model from scratch is computationally demanding,
maintaining multiple copies of the DNN parameters increases storage
requirements, and switching the full set of weights during inference increases
memory bandwidth. In this paper, we present an approach that addresses all
these challenges. It involves the systematic design and training of bottleneck
units - simple, low-cost neural networks - that can be inserted at the point of
split. Our approach is remarkably lightweight, both during training and
inference, highly effective and achieves excellent rate-distortion performance

can be modelled through polynomial functions. In this paper, we provide a
computational means to find positively invariant sets of polynomial dynamical
systems by using semidefinite programming to solve sum-of-squares (SOS)
programmes. With the emergence of SOS programmes, it is possible to efficiently
search for Lyapunov functions that guarantee stability of polynomial systems.
Yet, SOS computations often fail to find functions, such that the conditions
hold in the entire state space. We show here that restricting the SOS
optimisation to specific domains enables us to obtain positively invariant
sets, thus facilitating the analysis of the dynamics by considering separately
each positively invariant set. In addition, we go beyond classical Lyapunov
stability analysis and use SOS decompositions to computationally implement
sufficient positivity conditions that guarantee existence, uniqueness, and
exponential stability of a limit cycle. Importantly, this approach is
applicable to systems of any dimension and, thus, goes beyond classical methods
that are restricted to two-dimensional phase space. We illustrate our different
results with applications to classical systems, such as the van der Pol
oscillator, the Fitzhugh-Nagumo neuronal equation, and the Lorenz system.

are the most commonly used sparse recovery techniques in a wide range of
applications. The complexity of these approaches is highly dependent on the
size of the dictionary chosen to represent the sparse signal. When the
dictionary has to be large to enable high accuracy reconstructions, greedy
strategies might however incur in prohibitive complexity. In this paper, we
propose first the formulation of a new type of sparse recovery problems where
the sparse signal is represented by a set of independent and smaller
dictionaries instead of a large single one. Then, we derive a low complexity
multdimensional orthogonal matching pursuit (MOMP) strategy for sparse recovery
with a multdimensional dictionary. The projection step is performed iteratively
on every dimension of the dictionary while fixing all other dimensions to
achieve high accuracy estimation at a reasonable complexity. Finally, we
formulate the problem of high resolution time domain channel estimation at
millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies as a multidimensional sparse recovery
problem that can be solved with MOMP. The channel estimates are later
transformed into high accuracy user position estimates exploiting a new
localization algorithm that leverages the particular geometry of indoor
channels. Simulation results show the effectiveness of MOMP for high accuracy
localization at millimeter wave frequencies when operating in realistic 3D
scenarios, with practical MIMO architectures feasible at mmWave, and without
resorting to perfect synchronization assumptions that simplify the problem.

temporal resolution discarding redundant visual information, thus bringing new
possibilities for object detection tasks. However, the existing methods of
applying the event camera to object detection tasks using deep learning methods
still have many problems. First, existing methods cannot take into account
objects with different velocities relative to the motion of the event camera
due to the global synchronized time window and temporal resolution. Second,
most of the existing methods rely on large parameter neural networks, which
implies a large computational burden and low inference speed, thus contrary to
the high temporal resolution of the event stream.
  In our work, we design a high-speed lightweight detector called Agile Event
Detector (AED) with a simple but effective data augmentation method. Also, we
propose an event stream representation tensor called Temporal Active Focus
(TAF), which takes full advantage of the asynchronous generation of event
stream data and is robust to the motion of moving objects. It can also be
constructed without much time-consuming. We further propose a module called the
Bifurcated Folding Module (BFM) to extract the rich temporal information in the

untwisted BLG-QDs, the zigzag edges of graphene host spontaneous magnetism with
varying magnetic configurations. As a BLG-QD being adiabatically twisted, the

angle changes across certain critical value, the magnetic configuration of the
quantum state sharply changes. For the twisting process with increasing or
decreasing twisting angle, the number and value of the critical twisting angles
are different. Thus, the twisting process with the twisting angle increasing

regular orthogonal simplex domains, which is analyzed in terms of resource
usage, and ii) the experimental evaluation in terms of speedup over a bounding
box approach and energy efficiency as elements per second per Watt. Results
from the analysis show that $\mathcal{H}$ has a potential speedup of up to
$2\times$ and $6\times$ for $2$ and $3$-simplices, respectively. Experimental
evaluation shows that $\mathcal{H}$ is competitive for $2$-simplices, reaching
$1.2\times \sim 2.0\times$ of speedup for different tests, which is on par with
the fastest state of the art approaches. For $3$-simplices $\mathcal{H}$
reaches up to $1.3\times \sim 6.0\times$ of speedup making it the fastest of
all. The extension of $\mathcal{H}$ to higher dimensional $m$-simplices is
feasible and has a potential speedup that scales as $m!$ given a proper
selection of parameters $r, \beta$ which are the scaling and replication
factors, respectively. In terms of energy consumption, although $\mathcal{H}$
is among the highest in power consumption, it compensates by its short
duration, making it one of the most energy efficient approaches. Lastly,
further improvements with Tensor and Ray Tracing Cores are analyzed, giving
insights to leverage each one of them. The results obtained in this work show
that $\mathcal{H}$ is a scalable and energy efficient map that can contribute
to the efficiency of GPU applications when they need to process $m$-simplex

ubiquitous in a variety of astrophysical objects and environments. In this
work, we use JWST/MIRI MRS spectroscopy of three Seyferts to compare their
nuclear PAH emission with that of star-forming regions. This study represents
the first of its kind using sub-arcsecond angular resolution data of local
luminous Seyferts (Lbol>10^44.46 erg/s) on a wide wavelength coverage (4.9-28.1
micron). We present an analysis of their nuclear PAH properties by comparing
the observed ratios with PAH diagnostic model grids, derived from theoretical
spectra. Our results show that a suite of PAH features is present in the
innermost parts (~0.45 arcsec at 12 micron; in the inner ~142-245 pc) of
luminous Seyfert galaxies. We find that the nuclear regions of AGN lie at
different positions of the PAH diagnostic diagrams, whereas the SF regions are
concentrated around the average values of SF galaxies. In particular, we find
that the nuclear PAH emission mainly originates in neutral PAHs. In contrast,
PAH emission originating in the SF regions favours ionised PAH grains. The
observed PAH ratios in the nuclear region of AGN-dominated galaxy NGC 6552
indicate the presence of larger-sized PAH molecules compared with those of the
SF regions. Therefore, our results provide evidence that the AGN have a
significant impact on the ionization state (and probably the size) of the PAH
grains on scales of ~142-245 pc.

For ill-posed problems like image deblurring, the optimization objective
contains a regularization term (also called the regularization functional) that

regularization term by hand using the idea of maximum a posterior estimation.
Then, we point out the limitations of such regularization-based methods, and

Knowledge distillation, which transfers the knowledge of a well-trained complex

former concern, but the best current distillation methods focus only on how to
make the student model imitate the predictions of the teacher model. To better

operator via optical elements, addressing a broad field of applications in the
areas of quantum photonics, microwave photonics and optical neural networks.
The transfer of linear operators into photonic experimental layouts typically
relies on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) techniques combining meshes of
cascaded 2x2 Mach Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs), with the main challenges
being the precision in the experimental representation of the targeted matrix,
referred to as fidelity, and the overall insertion loss. We demonstrate a novel
interferometric coherent photonic crossbar architecture (Xbar) that demarcates
from state-of-the-art SVD implementations and can realize any linear operator,
supporting full restoration of the loss-induced fidelity. Its novel
interferometric design allows for the direct mapping of each matrix element to
a single, designated Xbar node, bringing down the number of programming steps
to only one. We present the theoretical foundations of the Xbar, proving that
its insertion losses scale linearly with the node losses as opposed to the
exponential scaling witnessed by the SVD counterparts. This leads to a matrix
design with significantly lower overall insertion losses compared to SVD-based
schemes when utilizing state-of-the-art silicon photonic fabrication metrics,
allowing for alternative node technologies with lower energy consumption and
higher operational speed credentials to be employed. Finally, we validate that
our Xbar architecture is the first linear operator that supports fidelity
restoration, outperforming SVD schemes in loss- and phase-error fidelity
performance and forming a significantly more robust layout to loss and phase
deviations.

  Propagation",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the problem of tracking a large-scale number of group
targets. Usually, multi-target in most tracking scenarios are assumed to have
independent motion and are well-separated. However, for group target tracking
(GTT), the targets within groups are closely spaced and move in a coordinated
manner, the groups can split or merge, and the numbers of targets in groups may
be large, which lead to more challenging data association, filtering and
computation problems. Within the belief propagation (BP) framework, we propose
a scalable group target belief propagation (GTBP) method by jointly inferring
target existence variables, group structure, data association and target
states. The method can efficiently calculate the approximations of the marginal
posterior distributions of these variables by performing belief propagation on
the devised factor graph. As a consequence, GTBP is capable of capturing the
changes in group structure, e.g., group splitting and merging. Furthermore, we
model the evolution of targets as the co-action of the group or single-target
motions specified by the possible group structures and corresponding
probabilities. This flexible modeling enables seamless and simultaneous
tracking of multiple group targets and ungrouped targets. Particularly, GTBP
has excellent scalability and low computational complexity. It not only
maintains the same scalability as BP, i.e., scaling linearly in the number of
sensor measurements and quadratically in the number of targets, but also only
scales linearly in the number of preserved group partitions. Finally, numerical
experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of
the proposed GTBP method.

neuroscience made over the last two to three decades have given further support
to a renewed interest into philosophical discussions of the mind-body problem.
Especially the last decade has seen a revival of panpsychist and idealist
considerations, often focused on solving philosophical puzzles like the
so-called hard problem of consciousness. While a number of respectable
philosophers advocate some sort of panpsychistic solution to the mind-body
problem now, fewer advocate that idealism can contribute substantially to the
debate. Interest in idealism has nevertheless risen again, as can be seen also
from recent overview articles and collections of works. The working hypothesis
here is that a properly formulated idealism can not only provide an alternative
view of the mind/matter gap, but that this new view will also shed light on
open questions in our common scientific, i.e. materialist, world view. To
investigate this possibility, idealism first of all needs a model for the
integration of modern science which allows for a mathematically consistent
reinterpretation of the physical world as a limiting case of a both material
and non-material world, which would make the outcome of idealistic
considerations accessible to scientific investigation. To develop such a model
I will first try to explain what I mean when I speak of a 'scientifically
tenable' idealism, including a formulation of the emanation problem which for
idealism replaces the interaction problem, then give a very brief summary of
the available elements of such a theory in the philosophical literature, before
sketching out some 'design questions' which have to be answered upon the
construction of such models, and finally put forward a first model for a
scientifically tenable objective idealism.

However, in reality, it is hard to build such a system once for all since the

advanced VQA systems. Recently, a pioneer work split a VQA dataset into
disjoint answer sets to study this topic. However, CL on VQA involves not only
the expansion of label sets (new Answer sets). It is crucial to study how to
answer questions when deploying VQA systems to new environments (new Visual
scenes) and how to answer questions requiring new functions (new Question
types). Thus, we propose CLOVE, a benchmark for Continual Learning On Visual
quEstion answering, which contains scene- and function-incremental settings for
the two aforementioned CL scenarios. In terms of methodology, the main
difference between CL on VQA and classification is that the former additionally
involves expanding and preventing forgetting of reasoning mechanisms, while the
latter focusing on class representation. Thus, we propose a real-data-free

impact of business process changes, e.g. what would be the cycle time of a
process if the number of traces increases? The starting point of BPS is a
business process model annotated with simulation parameters (a BPS model).
Several studies have proposed methods to automatically discover BPS models from
event logs -- extracted from enterprise information systems -- via process
mining techniques. These approaches model the processing time of each activity
based on the start and end timestamps recorded in the event log. In practice,
however, it is common that the recorded start times do not precisely reflect
the actual start of the activities. For example, a resource starts working on
an activity, but its start time is not recorded until she/he interacts with the
system. If not corrected, these situations induce waiting times in which the
resource is considered to be free, while she/he is actually working. To address
this limitation, this article proposes a technique to identify the waiting time
previous to each activity instance in which the resource is actually working on
them, and repair their start time so that they reflect the actual processing
time. The idea of the proposed technique is that, as far as simulation is
concerned, an activity instance may start once it is enabled and the
corresponding resource is available. Accordingly, for each activity instance,
the proposed technique estimates the activity enablement and the resource
availability time based on the information available in the event log, and
repairs the start time to include the non-recorded processing time. An
empirical evaluation involving eight real-life event logs shows that the
proposed approach leads to BPS models that closely reflect the temporal
dynamics of the process.

Specifically, a multi-stage Transformer (MST) encoder is constructed to model

sequential latent Transformer (SLT) with self-supervised learning objectives is
employed to distill the future predictive information into the latent scene

The final decision-making module based on soft actor-critic (SAC) takes as

existing LKA models employ flexible deep learning models that excel at this

faith that deep learning models that work well on images will also work well on
videos is actually flawed. We show that even when a video camera is viewing a
scene that is not changing in any human-perceptible way, and we control for
external factors like video compression and environment (lighting), the
accuracy of video analytics application fluctuates noticeably. These
fluctuations occur because successive frames produced by the video camera may
look similar visually, but these frames are perceived quite differently by the
video analytics applications. We observed that the root cause for these
fluctuations is the dynamic camera parameter changes that a video camera
automatically makes in order to capture and produce a visually pleasing video.
The camera inadvertently acts as an unintentional adversary because these
slight changes in the image pixel values in consecutive frames, as we show,
have a noticeably adverse impact on the accuracy of insights from video
analytics tasks that re-use image-trained deep learning models. To address this
inadvertent adversarial effect from the camera, we explore the use of transfer

  impact the global AI market",,,,,"cs.CY cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The European Union is likely to introduce among the first, most stringent,
and most comprehensive AI regulatory regimes of the world's major
jurisdictions. In this report, we ask whether the EU's upcoming regulation for
AI will diffuse globally, producing a so-called ""Brussels Effect"". Building on
and extending Anu Bradford's work, we outline the mechanisms by which such
regulatory diffusion may occur. We consider both the possibility that the EU's
AI regulation will incentivise changes in products offered in non-EU countries
(a de facto Brussels Effect) and the possibility it will influence regulation
adopted by other jurisdictions (a de jure Brussels Effect). Focusing on the
proposed EU AI Act, we tentatively conclude that both de facto and de jure
Brussels effects are likely for parts of the EU regulatory regime. A de facto
effect is particularly likely to arise in large US tech companies with AI
systems that the AI Act terms ""high-risk"". We argue that the upcoming
regulation might be particularly important in offering the first and most
influential operationalisation of what it means to develop and deploy
trustworthy or human-centred AI. If the EU regime is likely to see significant
diffusion, ensuring it is well-designed becomes a matter of global importance.

  a comparison of an Olympic medalist and university athletes","16 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Automatic fault detection is a major challenge in many sports. In race
walking, referees visually judge faults according to the rules. Hence, ensuring
objectivity and fairness while judging is important. To address this issue,
some studies have attempted to use sensors and machine learning to
automatically detect faults. However, there are problems associated with sensor
attachments and equipment such as a high-speed camera, which conflict with the
visual judgement of referees, and the interpretability of the fault detection
models. In this study, we proposed a fault detection system for non-contact
measurement. We used pose estimation and machine learning models trained based
on the judgements of multiple qualified referees to realize fair fault
judgement. We verified them using smartphone videos of normal race walking and
walking with intentional faults in several athletes including the medalist of
the Tokyo Olympics. The validation results show that the proposed system
detected faults with an average accuracy of over 90%. We also revealed that the
machine learning model detects faults according to the rules of race walking.
In addition, the intentional faulty walking movement of the medalist was
different from that of university walkers. This finding informs realization of
a more general fault detection model. The code and data are available at
https://github.com/SZucchini/racewalk-aijudge.

often have problematically idealized views of science. These preconceptions can
become obstacles for students in their own professional growth. Unfortunately,
existing curricular and extracurricular programming in many doctoral programs
fail to include mechanisms to systematically address students' misconceptions
of their profession. In this work, we describe a new initiative at our
institution that aims to address Ph.D. mental health via a mandatory seminar
for entering doctoral students. The seminar is designed to build professional
resilience in students by (1) increasing self-regulatory competence, and (2)
teaching students to proactively examine academic cultural values and to
participate in shaping them. Our evaluation indicates that students improved in
both areas after completing the seminar.

quantales. To obtain the reflection we construct free quantales over marked
quantales using appropriate lower sets.
  A marked quantale is a posemigroup in which certain admissible subsets are
required to have joins, and multiplication distributes over these. Sometimes
are the admissible subsets in question specified by means of a so-called
selection function. A distinguishing feature of the study of marked quantales
is that a small collection of axioms of an elementary nature allows one to do
much that is traditional at the level of quantales. The axioms are sufficiently
general to include as examples of marked quantales the classes of posemigroups,
$\sigma$-quantales, prequantales and quantales. Furthermore, we discuss another
reflection to quantales obtained by the injective hull of a posemigroup.

emission (UPE) of GRB 180720B observed in the rest-frame time interval $t_{\rm
rf}=4.84$--$10.89$~s by Fermi-GBM. We reveal the UPE hierarchical structure
from the time-resolved spectral analysis performed in time sub-intervals: the
spectrum in each shorter time interval is always fitted by a composite
blackbody plus cutoff power-law model. We explain this structure with the
\textit{inner engine} of binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model operating in a
quantum electrodynamics (QED) regime. In this regime, the electric field
induced by the gravitomagnetic interaction of the newborn Kerr BH with the
surrounding magnetic field is overcritical, i.e., $|{\bf E}|\geq E_c$, where
$E_c=m_e^2 c^3/(e\hbar)$. The overcritical field polarizes the vacuum leading
to an $e^+~e^-$ pair plasma that loads baryons from the surroundings during its
expansion. We calculate the dynamics of the self-acceleration of the
pair-electromagnetic-baryon (PEMB) pulses to their point of transparency. We
characterize the quantum vacuum polarization process in the sequences of
decreasing time bins of the UPE by determining the radiation timescale, Lorentz
factors, and transparency radius of the PEMB pulses. We also estimate the
strength of the surrounding magnetic field $\sim 10^{14}$ G, and obtain a lower
limit to the BH mass, $M=2.4~M_\odot$, and correspondingly an upper limit to
the spin, $\alpha = 0.6$, from the conditions that the UPE is powered by the
Kerr BH extractable energy and its mass is bound from below by the NS critical
mass.

puzzles in fundamental physics. Naively, quantum field theory arguments would
imply a cosmological constant which is up to 10$^{120}$ times larger than the
observed one. It is believed a comprehensive theory of quantum gravity would
resolve this enormous mismatch between theory and observation. In this work, we
study the ability of generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) models, which are
phenomenologically motivated models of quantum gravity, to address the
cosmological constant problem. In particular, we focus on how these GUP models
may change the phase space of QFT, and how this affects the momentum space
integration of the zero-point energies of normal modes of fields. We point out
several issues that make it unlikely that GUP models, in their current form,
would be able to adequately address the cosmological constant problem.

simultaneously discover, measure, and attempt to reduce their potentially
harmful outputs. We make three main contributions. First, we investigate
scaling behaviors for red teaming across 3 model sizes (2.7B, 13B, and 52B
parameters) and 4 model types: a plain language model (LM); an LM prompted to
be helpful, honest, and harmless; an LM with rejection sampling; and a model
trained to be helpful and harmless using reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). We find that the RLHF models are increasingly difficult to red
team as they scale, and we find a flat trend with scale for the other model
types. Second, we release our dataset of 38,961 red team attacks for others to
analyze and learn from. We provide our own analysis of the data and find a
variety of harmful outputs, which range from offensive language to more subtly
harmful non-violent unethical outputs. Third, we exhaustively describe our
instructions, processes, statistical methodologies, and uncertainty about red
teaming. We hope that this transparency accelerates our ability to work
together as a community in order to develop shared norms, practices, and
technical standards for how to red team language models.
