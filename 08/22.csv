remediations have typically either compromised accuracy or required full model
re-training with each new class of attacks. We propose a novel method of
retroactively adding resilience to misspellings to transformer-based NLP
models. This robustness can be achieved without the need for re-training of the
original NLP model and with only a minimal loss of language understanding
performance on inputs without misspellings. Additionally we propose a new
efficient approximate method of generating adversarial misspellings, which
significantly reduces the cost needed to evaluate a model's resilience to
adversarial attacks.

that the Schwinger confinement mechanism persists even for massive quarks in
(1+1)D. Could such a QED-confined $q\bar q$ one-dimensional open string in
(1+1)D be the idealization of a flux tube in the physical world in (3+1)D,
similar to the case of QCD-confined $q\bar q$ open string? If so, the
QED-confined $q\bar q$ bosons may show up as neutral QED mesons in the mass
region of many tens of MeV (PRC81(2010)064903 \& JHEP08(2020)165). Is it ever
possible that a quark and an antiquark be produced and interact in QED alone to
form a confined QED meson? Is there any experimental evidence for the existence
of a QED meson (or QED mesons)? The observations of the anomalous soft photons,
the X17 particle, and the E38 particle suggest that they may bear the

computer-assisted interventions. Current approaches are mostly based on
supervised methods which require large fully labeled data to train supervised

However large image datasets with bounding box annotations are often scarcely
available. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a means for
training large models using only a modest amount of annotated data; apart from
reducing the annotation cost. SSL has also shown promise to produce models that
are more robust and generalizable. Therefore, in this paper we introduce a
semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework in surgical tool detection paradigm
which aims to mitigate the scarcity of training data and the data imbalance
through a knowledge distillation approach. In the proposed work, we train a
model with labeled data which initialises the Teacher-Student joint learning,
where the Student is trained on Teacher-generated pseudo labels from unlabeled
data. We propose a multi-class distance with a margin based classification loss

wavelets. We show that, with overwhelmingly high probability, only an
asymptotically negligible fraction of the off-diagonal entries in random but
large strictly ultrametric matrices remain non-zero after the transformation;
and develop a fast algorithm to compress such matrices directly from their tree

wavelets and supply a sufficient condition to approximate the spectrum of
strictly ultrametric matrices outside this subclass. Our methods give
computational access to a covariance model of the microbiologists' Tree of
Life, which was previously inaccessible due to its size, and motivate defining
a new but wavelet-based phylogenetic $\beta$-diversity metric. Applying this

keyboards, several prototypes augmenting pianos with different projections

implemented in order to support piano players. However, it is still not

this paper we present a systematic review of augmented piano prototypes
focusing on instrument learning, which is based on the four themes derived from
interviews of piano experts to better understand the problems of teaching the
piano. These themes are: (i) synchronised movement and body posture, (ii)
sight-reading, (iii) ensuring motivation, and (iv) encouraging improvisation.
We found that prototypes are saturated on the synchronisation themes, and there
are opportunities for sight-reading, motivation, and improvisation themes. We
conclude by presenting recommendations on augmenting piano systems towards
enriching the piano learning experience as well as on possible directions to
expand knowledge in the area.

due to class-specific mode collapse for tail classes, which we observe to be
correlated with the spectral explosion of the conditioning parameter matrix. We
propose a novel group Spectral Regularizer (gSR) that prevents the spectral

alternative methods including the use of electromagnetic waves in the treatment
of diseases. As a result, the therapeutic use of electromagnetic waves in the
treatment of neurological diseases has made significant progress. Among the
various techniques that have revolutionized the non-invasive treatment of
neurological disorders, there is a remarkable technique called Repetitive
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). On the other hand, there is a wide
range of neurological conditions (like epilepsy) that are somewhat
drug-resistant or can only be controlled with high-risk treatments. In this
article, the effect of rTMS on epilepsy is investigated.

concerns including single point of failure, privacy violation, and oligopoly.
To eliminate the dependency on such a centralized storage architecture, several
Decentralized Storage Network (DSN) schemes such as Filecoin, Sia, and Storj
have been introduced. DSNs leverage blockchain technology to create a storage
platform such that the micro storage providers can also participate in the
storage market. To verify the accurate data storage by the storage providers
during a storage contract, DSNs apply a Proof of Storage (PoS) scheme to
continuously inspect the storage service. However, continuous verification of
the storage provider imposes an extra cost to the network and therefore
end-users. Moreover, DSN's PoS verification is vulnerable to a service denying
attack in which the storage provider submits valid PoS to the network while
denying the service to the client.
  Considering the benefits and existing challenges of DSNs, this paper
introduces a novel incentive-compatible DSN scheme. In this scheme, the PoS is
conducted only if the client submits a challenge request. We model the storage
service as a repeated dynamic game and set the players' payoffs such that the
storage provider's dominant strategy is to honestly follow the storage
contract. Our proposed mechanism leverages the smart-contract and oracle
network to govern the storage agreement between the client and storage provider
efficiently. Furthermore, our scheme is independent of a specific blockchain
platform but can be plugged into any blockchain platform with smart-contract
execution capability. As a proof of concept, we have implemented our scheme
using solidity language and chainlink oracle network. The performance analysis
demonstrates the applicability of our scheme.

Semantic NMF with automatic model selection (SeNMFk) has been proposed as a
modification to NMF. In addition to heuristically estimating the number of
topics, SeNMFk also incorporates the semantic structure of the text. This is
performed by jointly factorizing the term frequency-inverse document frequency

represent the number of times two words co-occur in a predetermined window of
the text. In this paper, we introduce a novel distributed method, SeNMFk-SPLIT,
for semantic topic extraction suitable for large corpora. Contrary to SeNMFk,
our method enables the joint factorization of large documents by decomposing
the word-context and term-document matrices separately. We demonstrate the
capability of SeNMFk-SPLIT by applying it to the entire artificial intelligence

by characterizing the mathematical operators used to project 3 color channels
to a single one. Based on the fact that most operators assign each of the
$256^3$ colors a single gray level, ranging from 0 to 255, they are clustering
algorithms that distribute the color population into 256 clusters of increasing
brightness. To visualize the way operators work the sizes of the clusters and
the average brightness of each cluster are plotted. The equalization mode (EQ)
introduced in this work focuses on cluster sizes, while the brightness mapping
(BM) mode describes the CIE L* luminance distribution per cluster. Three
classes of EQ modes and two classes of BM modes were found in linear operators,
defining a 6-class taxonomy. The theoretical/methodological framework
introduced was applied in a case study considering the equal-weights uniform
operator, the NTSC standard operator, and an operator chosen as ideal to
lighten the faces of black people to improve facial recognition in current
biased classifiers. It was found that most current metrics used to assess the
quality of color-to-gray conversions better assess one of the two BM mode
classes, but the ideal operator chosen by a human team belongs to the other
class. Therefore, this cautions against using these general metrics for
specific purpose color-to-gray conversions. It should be noted that eventual
applications of this framework to non-linear operators can give rise to new
classes of EQ and BM modes. The main contribution of this article is to provide
a tool to better understand color to gray converters in general, even those
based on machine learning, within the current trend of better explainability of

optimal solutions that satisfy the group fairness constraints, we aim to
achieve `probabilistic individual fairness' by computing a distribution over
`group fair' matchings such that each item has a reasonable probability of
being matched to one of its top choices. When each item can belong to multiple
groups, the problem of finding a maximum size group-fair matching is NP-hard

`mindom group fairness', which minimizes the representation of the most

should be powered by ultrarelativistic jets launched from black hole (BH)
hyperaccretion in compact object mergers and massive collapsars, respectively.
However, the duration criterion sometimes cannot correctly reflect the physical
origin of a particular GRB. In the collapsar scenario, a GRB can be observed
when the jet breaks out from the envelope and circumstellar medium
successfully. The observed GRB duration reflects only the time that the engine
operates after the jet breaks out. This work studies the propagation of jets
driven by the neutrino annihilation or Blandford-Znajek mechanism in massive
collapsars. The signatures of the progenitors for producing LGRBs, SGRBs, and
failed GRBs in the collapsar scenario are exhibited. The competition between
the mass supply onto the BH hyperaccretion and jet propagation into the
envelope are definitely dependent on the density profiles of the collapsars. We
show that duration and isotropic energy $E_{\rm{\gamma,iso}}$ of GRBs can help
constrain the density profiles of collapsars. Finally, we propose that a

field around the vortices shows that the contributions of the QSV to the
quadrant Reynolds shear stresses change significantly during the control cycle.
On the one hand, as for OW, the suppression of Q2 events (with upwelling of

the other, the enhancement of Q2 and also Q4 events (with downwelling of
high-speed fluid toward the wall) is related to drag increase. Based on the

principal directions of the rate-of-strain tensor induced by the StTW, a
predictive correlation for drag reduction by StTW is proposed which uses

has become one of the most exciting learning paradigms and has shown great
potential in handling graph data. However, real-world graphs are always
heterogeneous, which poses three critical challenges that existing methods
ignore: 1) how to capture complex graph structure? 2) how to incorporate
various node attributes? and 3) how to encode different node positions? In
light of this, we study the problem of generative SSL on heterogeneous graphs
and propose HGMAE, a novel heterogeneous graph masked autoencoder model to
address these challenges. HGMAE captures comprehensive graph information via
two innovative masking techniques and three unique training strategies. In
particular, we first develop metapath masking and adaptive attribute masking
with dynamic mask rate to enable effective and stable learning on heterogeneous
graphs. We then design several training strategies including metapath-based
edge reconstruction to adopt complex structural information, target attribute
restoration to incorporate various node attributes, and positional feature
prediction to encode node positional information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HGMAE outperforms both contrastive and generative
state-of-the-art baselines on several tasks across multiple datasets. Codes are

generalize the notion of disorder hyperuniformity, a recently discovered exotic

quantify the density fluctuations in amorphous carbon nanotubes containing
randomly distributed Stone-Wales defects. We demonstrate that all of these
amorphous nanotubes are hyperuniform, i.e., the infinite-wavelength density
fluctuations of these systems are completely suppressed, regardless of the
diameter, rolling axis, number of rolling sheets, and defect fraction of the
nanotubes. We find that these amorphous nanotubes are energetically more stable
than nanotubes with periodically distributed Stone-Wales defects. Moreover,
certain semiconducting defect-free carbon nanotubes become metallic as
sufficiently large amounts of defects are randomly introduced. This structural
study of amorphous nanotubes strengthens our fundamental understanding of these
systems, and suggests possible exotic physical properties, as endowed by their
disordered hyperuniformity. Our findings also shed light on the effect of
dimensionality reduction on the hyperuniformity property of materials.

This demand propels a growing number of easy-to-use tools and training for
aspiring data scientists that enable the rapid building of predictive models.
Today, weapons of math destruction can be easily built and deployed without
detailed planning and validation. This rapidly extends the list of AI failures,
i.e. deployments that lead to financial losses or even violate democratic
values such as equality, freedom and justice. The lack of planning, rules and
standards around the model development leads to the ,,anarchisation of AI"".
This problem is reported under different names such as validation debt,
reproducibility crisis, and lack of explainability. Post-mortem analysis of AI
failures often reveals mistakes made in the early phase of model development or
data acquisition. Thus, instead of curing the consequences of deploying harmful
models, we shall prevent them as early as possible by putting more attention to
the initial planning stage.
  In this paper, we propose a quick and simple framework to support planning of
AI solutions. The POCA framework is based on four pillars: Performance,
Opaqueness, Consequences, and Assumptions. It helps to set the expectations and
plan the constraints for the AI solution before any model is built and any data
is collected. With the help of the POCA method, preliminary requirements can be
defined for the model-building process, so that costly model misspecification
errors can be identified as soon as possible or even avoided. AI researchers,
product owners and business analysts can use this framework in the initial

model's blackbox behavior to a model builder. They indicate the influence of
different input attributes to its corresponding model prediction. The
dependency of explanations on input raises privacy concerns for sensitive user
data. However, current literature has limited discussion on privacy risks of
model explanations.
  We focus on the specific privacy risk of attribute inference attack wherein
an adversary infers sensitive attributes of an input (e.g., race and sex) given
its model explanations. We design the first attribute inference attack against
model explanations in two threat models where model builder either (a) includes
the sensitive attributes in training data and input or (b) censors the
sensitive attributes by not including them in the training data and input.
  We evaluate our proposed attack on four benchmark datasets and four
state-of-the-art algorithms. We show that an adversary can successfully infer
the value of sensitive attributes from explanations in both the threat models
accurately. Moreover, the attack is successful even by exploiting only the
explanations corresponding to sensitive attributes. These suggest that our
attack is effective against explanations and poses a practical threat to data
privacy.
  On combining the model predictions (an attack surface exploited by prior
attacks) with explanations, we note that the attack success does not improve.
Additionally, the attack success on exploiting model explanations is better
compared to exploiting only model predictions. These suggest that model
explanations are a strong attack surface to exploit for an adversary.

are a consequence of training on scarce target data. Additionally, the
self-attention mechanism enables interactions among instruments to be accounted
for, not just at the loss level during model training, but also at inference
time. Focusing on momentum applied to the top ten cryptocurrencies by market
capitalisation as a demonstrative use-case, the Fused Encoder Networks
outperforms the reference benchmarks on most performance measures, delivering a
three-fold boost in the Sharpe ratio over classical momentum as well as an

form factor in nuclear beta decay. The precision of the three-dimensional

identification of backscattering from scintillator, facilitated a reduction of
the main systematics effects. At certain conditions, a spatial resolution
better than 0.5 mm was obtained in the plane perpendicular to the wires, while
resolutions of about 6 mm were achieved along wires. Thanks to precise tracking
information, it is possible to eliminate electrons and other particles not

origin of diffusion anisotropy. The FG modeling prescription allows us to
assume direction-dependent diffusion described by Laplacian. To implement such
diffusion anisotropy in the FG modeling, we need an internal degree of freedom
(IDF), which depends on direction and position and is controlled by some
external forces or stimuli. For such a direction-dependent IDF, we use velocity
directions corresponding to thermal fluctuations of the lattice vertices. We
find that anisotropic Turing patterns emerge in the direction along which
vertices fluctuate. In the simulations, direction-dependent diffusion
coefficients are unnecessary for input, and instead, the IDF aligns the
direction of vertex fluctuation along a direction implemented by external
stimuli. Our results and techniques provide insight into the origin of
diffusion anisotropy connected to Turing patterns.

  Spatiotemporal Data",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Probabilistic modeling of multidimensional spatiotemporal data is critical to
many real-world applications. As real-world spatiotemporal data often exhibits
complex dependencies that are nonstationary and nonseparable, developing
effective and computationally efficient statistical models to accommodate
nonstationary/nonseparable processes containing both long-range and short-scale
variations becomes a challenging task, in particular for large-scale datasets
with various corruption/missing structures. In this paper, we propose a new
statistical framework -- Bayesian Complementary Kernelized Learning (BCKL) --
to achieve scalable probabilistic modeling for multidimensional spatiotemporal
data. To effectively characterize complex dependencies, BCKL integrates two
complementary approaches -- kernelized low-rank tensor factorization and
short-range spatiotemporal Gaussian Processes. Specifically, we use a
multi-linear low-rank factorization component to capture the global/long-range
correlations in the data and introduce an additive short-scale GP based on
compactly supported kernel functions to characterize the remaining local
variabilities. We develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithm for model inference and evaluate the proposed BCKL framework on both
synthetic and real-world spatiotemporal datasets. Our experiment results show
that BCKL offers superior performance in providing accurate posterior mean and
high-quality uncertainty estimates, confirming the importance of both global
and local components in modeling spatiotemporal data.

increasing attention in e-commerce and social media platforms. However, there
still lack efforts to evaluate the robustness of such CF systems in deployment.
Fundamentally different from existing attacks, this work revisits the item
promotion task and reformulates it from a targeted topological attack
perspective for the first time. Specifically, we first develop a targeted
attack formulation to maximally increase a target item's popularity. We then
leverage gradient-based optimizations to find a solution. However, we observe
the gradient estimates often appear noisy due to the discrete nature of a
graph, which leads to a degradation of attack ability. To resolve noisy
gradient effects, we then propose a masked attack objective that can remarkably
enhance the topological attack ability. Furthermore, we design a
computationally efficient approach to the proposed attack, thus making it
feasible to evaluate large-large CF systems. Experiments on two real-world
datasets show the effectiveness of our attack in analyzing the robustness of
GNN-based CF more practically.

graph contrastive learning to fuse the semantic information from the global

massless scalar perturbations of a black hole in the generalized Rastall
gravity. The black hole metric in question is spherically symmetric,
accompanied by a power-Maxwell field surrounded by a quintessence fluid. It is
shown that the massless scalar field, when {\it dressed up} with the magnetic
field, acquires an effective mass which, in turn, significantly affects the
properties of the resultant quasinormal oscillations and late-time tails. To be
specific, the quasinormal frequencies become distorted and might even be
unstable for particular spacetime configurations. Also, the exponent of the
usual power-law tail is modified in accordance with the modification in the
structure of the branch cut of the retarded Green's function. In particular, as
the effective mass is generated dynamically due to the presence of the magnetic
field, one may consider a process through which the field is gradually removed
from the spacetime configuration. In this context, while the quasinormal
oscillations converge to the case of massless perturbations, we argue that the
properties of resultant late-time tails do not fall back to their massless
counterpart. The relevant features are investigated by numerical and analytic
approaches.

however, proved difficult to measure, despite being an important parameter for
constraining the observational appearance. In the first paper of this series we
asked whether the width of the ring was sensitive to the choice of likelihood
function used to compare observed closure phases and closure amplitudes to
model predictions. In this paper we investigate whether the ring width is
robust to changes in the model itself. We construct a more realistic geometric
model with two new features: an adjustable radial falloff in brightness, and a
secondary ""photon ring"" component in addition to the primary annulus. This
thin, secondary ring is predicted by gravitational lensing for any black hole
with an optically thin accretion flow. Analyzing the data using the new model,
we find that the primary annulus remains narrow (fractional width $\leq0.25$)
even with the added model freedom. This provides further evidence in favor of a
narrow ring for the true sky appearance of M87*, a surprising feature that, if
confirmed, would demand theoretical explanation. Comparing the Bayesian
evidence for models with and without a secondary ring, we find no evidence for
the presence of a lensed photon ring in the 2017 observations. However, the
techniques we introduce may prove useful for future observations with a larger

how it is possible to reduce the complexity of constructing an approximate CP

order-4 Coulomb interaction tensor approximated by 2 order-3 tensors via an
approximate generalized square-root (SQ) factorization, such as density fitting
or (pivoted) Cholesky. The complexity of constructing a 4-way CP decomposition
is reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^4 R_\text{CP})$ (for the non-approximated
Coulomb tensor) to $\mathcal{O}(n^3 R_\text{CP})$ for the SQ-factorized tensor,
where $n$ and $R_\text{CP}$ are the basis and CP ranks, respectively. This
reduces the cost of constructing the CP approximation of 2-body interaction
tensors of relevance to accurate many-body electronic structure by up to 2
orders of magnitude for systems with up to 36 atoms studied here. The full
4-way CP approximation of the Coulomb interaction tensor is shown to be more
accurate than the known approaches utilizing CP-decomposed SQ factors (also
obtained at the $\mathcal{O}(n^3 R_\text{CP})$ cost), such as the algebraic
pseudospectral and tensor hypercontraction approaches. The CP decomposed SQ
factors can also serve as a robust initial guess for the 4-way CP factors.

sound reduction regardless of the incident direction of the sound. When desired
sound is present, the state-of-the-art methods add a separate system to
reconstruct it. This can result in distortion and latency. In this work, we
propose a multi-channel ANC system that only reduces sound from undesired
directions, and the system truly preserves the desired sound instead of
reproducing it. The proposed algorithm imposes a spatial constraint on the
hybrid ANC cost function to achieve spatial selectivity. Based on a six-channel
microphone array on a pair of augmented eyeglasses, results show that the
system minimized only noise coming from undesired directions. The control
performance could be maintained even when the array was heavily perturbed. The
proposed algorithm was also compared with the existing methods in the
literature. Not only did the proposed system provide better noise reduction,
but it also required much less effort. The binaural localization cues did not
need to be reconstructed since the system preserved the physical sound wave
from the desired source.

utterances into code snippets. The sequence-to-tree (Seq2Tree) approaches are
proposed for code generation, with the guarantee of the grammatical correctness
of the generated code, which generate the subsequent Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
node relying on antecedent predictions of AST nodes. Existing Seq2Tree methods
tend to treat both antecedent predictions and subsequent predictions equally.
However, under the AST constraints, it is difficult for Seq2Tree models to
produce the correct subsequent prediction based on incorrect antecedent
predictions. Thus, antecedent predictions ought to receive more attention than
subsequent predictions. To this end, in this paper, we propose an effective
method, named Antecedent Prioritized (AP) Loss, that helps the model attach
importance to antecedent predictions by exploiting the position information of
the generated AST nodes. We design an AST-to-Vector (AST2Vec) method, that maps
AST node positions to two-dimensional vectors, to model the position
information of AST nodes. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed loss,
we implement and train an Antecedent Prioritized Tree-based code generation
model called APT. With better antecedent predictions and accompanying
subsequent predictions, APT significantly improves the performance. We conduct
extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and the experimental results
demonstrate the superiority and generality of our proposed method.

  Classification","Accepted in ECCVw",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-label image classification aims to predict all possible labels in an
image. It is usually formulated as a partial-label learning problem, given the
fact that it could be expensive in practice to annotate all labels in every
training image. Existing works on partial-label learning focus on the case
where each training image is annotated with only a subset of its labels. A
special case is to annotate only one positive label in each training image. To
further relieve the annotation burden and enhance the performance of the
classifier, this paper proposes a new partial-label setting in which only a
subset of the training images are labeled, each with only one positive label,
while the rest of the training images remain unlabeled. To handle this new
setting, we propose an end-to-end deep network, PLMCL (Partial Label Momentum
Curriculum Learning), that can learn to produce confident pseudo labels for
both partially-labeled and unlabeled training images. The novel momentum-based
law updates soft pseudo labels on each training image with the consideration of
the updating velocity of pseudo labels, which help avoid trapping to
low-confidence local minimum, especially at the early stage of training in lack
of both observed labels and confidence on pseudo labels. In addition, we
present a confidence-aware scheduler to adaptively perform easy-to-hard
learning for different labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed PLMCL outperforms many state-of-the-art multi-label classification
methods under various partial-label settings on three different datasets.

oscillators within a cascaded optomechanical configuration, where the two
optomechanical resonators are indirectly coupled through a telecommunication

can break the time reversal symmetry of this compound system via Sagnac effect,

systems. First, their lack of distinguishing visual features makes transparent
objects harder to detect and localize than opaque objects. Even humans find
certain transparent surfaces with little specular reflection or refraction,
e.g. glass doors, difficult to perceive. A second challenge is that common
depth sensors typically used for opaque object perception cannot obtain
accurate depth measurements on transparent objects due to their unique
reflective properties. Stemming from these challenges, we observe that
transparent object instances within the same category (e.g. cups) look more
similar to each other than to ordinary opaque objects of that same category.
Given this observation, the present paper sets out to explore the possibility
of category-level transparent object pose estimation rather than instance-level
pose estimation. We propose TransNet, a two-stage pipeline that learns to
estimate category-level transparent object pose using localized depth
completion and surface normal estimation. TransNet is evaluated in terms of
pose estimation accuracy on a recent, large-scale transparent object dataset

consists of a training/validation set containing 43,727 diverse images

an efficient plug-and-play module in the frond-end of a building extraction

inaccurate labels in the other datasets can cause about 20% IoU decrease. The

the dependence of the fraction of three populations (Blue Cloud, Green Valley,

blue cloud fraction goes down with increasing environment density, while red
sequence fraction is opposite. For the most massive GV galaxies, a sharp drop
appears in the denser environment. Coupled with the mass dependence of three

sources within the 95% Fermi uncertainty regions. Recently, Kerby et al.
employed neural networks to find blazar candidates among these 238 X-ray
counterparts to the 4FGL unassociated sources and found 112 likely blazar
counterpart sources. A complete sample of blazars, along with their
sub-classification, is a necessary step to help understand the puzzle of the
blazar sequence and for the overall completeness of the gamma-ray emitting
blazar class in the Fermi catalog. We employed a multi-perceptron neural
network classifier to identify FSRQs and BL Lacs among these 112 blazar
candidates using the gamma-ray, X-ray, UV/optical, and IR properties. This
classifier provided probability estimates for each source to be associated with
one or the other category, such that P_fsrq represents the probability for a
source to be associated with the FSRQ subclass. Using this approach, 4 FSRQs
and 50 BL Lacs are classified as such with >99% confidence, while the remaining
58 blazars could not be unambiguously classified as either BL Lac or FSRQ.

are micro-scale changes caused by photoisomerization at the nanoscale and lead
to the realization of important functions as optical devices. However, the
theoretical models behind these phenomena are not well understood. In this
paper, we construct a mathematical model that can treat diverse phenomena in a
unified model by using swallow-tail catastrophe, a higher-order catastrophe
than cusp catastrophe, from the seven elementary catastrophes that can describe
discontinuities in the phenomena. By introducing the hyperbolic operating
curves in the model, intrinsic properties of the photochromic crystals are
represented. The induced morphogenesis, such as bending, cracking, and
photosalient, are systematically classified by the proposed catastrophe model,
which even implies unexplored operating conditions of the crystals and explains

stationary points or local minimum in nonconvex, possibly with nonsmooth
regularizer, finite-sum and online optimization problems. First, we propose a
simple proximal stochastic gradient algorithm based on variance reduction
called ProxSVRG+. We provide a clean and tight analysis of ProxSVRG+, which
shows that it outperforms the deterministic proximal gradient descent (ProxGD)
for a wide range of minibatch sizes, hence solves an open problem proposed in
Reddi et al. (2016b). Also, ProxSVRG+ uses much less proximal oracle calls than
ProxSVRG (Reddi et al., 2016b) and extends to the online setting by avoiding
full gradient computations. Then, we further propose an optimal algorithm,
called SSRGD, based on SARAH (Nguyen et al., 2017) and show that SSRGD further
improves the gradient complexity of ProxSVRG+ and achieves the optimal upper
bound, matching the known lower bound of (Fang et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021).
Moreover, we show that both ProxSVRG+ and SSRGD enjoy automatic adaptation with
local structure of the objective function such as the Polyak-\L{}ojasiewicz
(PL) condition for nonconvex functions in the finite-sum case, i.e., we prove
that both of them can automatically switch to faster global linear convergence
without any restart performed in prior work ProxSVRG (Reddi et al., 2016b).
Finally, we focus on the more challenging problem of finding an $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-local minimum instead of just finding an $\epsilon$-approximate
(first-order) stationary point (which may be some bad unstable saddle points).
We show that SSRGD can find an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-local minimum by simply
adding some random perturbations. Our algorithm is almost as simple as its
counterpart for finding stationary points, and achieves similar optimal rates.

and response pairs from different environments. As a consequence, one has to
apply learned predictors to data with a different distribution due to
distribution shifts. One principled approach is to adopt the structural causal
models to describe training and test models, following the invariance principle
which says that the conditional distribution of the response given its
predictors remains the same across environments. However, this principle might
be violated in practical settings when the response is intervened. A natural
question is whether it is still possible to identify other forms of invariance
to facilitate prediction in unseen environments. To shed light on this
challenging scenario, we introduce invariant matching property (IMP) which is
an explicit relation to capture interventions through an additional feature.
This leads to an alternative form of invariance that enables a unified
treatment of general interventions on the response. We analyze the asymptotic
generalization errors of our method under both the discrete and continuous
environment settings, where the continuous case is handled by relating it to
the semiparametric varying coefficient models. We present algorithms that show

learning-enhanced branching methods based on the key observation that, in such
operational applications, instances are significantly similar to each other.
Specifically, instances typically share the same size and problem structure,
with slight differences only on matrix coefficients, right-hand sides and
objective function. In addition, certain groups of variables within a given
instance are also typically similar to each other. Therefore, unlike previous
works in the literature which predicted all branching scores with a single ML
model, we propose training separate ML models per variable or per groups of

large-scale SCUC instances and we obtain significantly better gap closures than
previous works with the same amount of training data.

reflected at the remote footpoint where significant brightenings are observed
in all the AIA extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) channels. This unique observation
provides us with the opportunity to better understand not only the thermal
properties and damping mechanisms of the sloshing oscillation, but also the
energy transfer at the remote footpoint. Based on differential emission
measures (DEM) analysis and the technique of coronal seismology, we find that
1) the calculated local sound speed is consistent with the observed propagation
speed of the perturbation during the oscillation, which is suggestive of a slow
magnetoacoustic wave; 2) thermal conduction is the major damping mechanism of
the wave but additional damping mechanism such as anomalous enhancement of
compressive viscosity or wave leakage is also required to account for the rapid
decay of the observed waves; 3) the wave produced a nanoflare at the remote
footpoint, with a peak thermal energy of $\thicksim10^{24}-10^{25}$ erg. This

coherent optical phonon modes, the electro-optic sampling measurements explored
the coexistence of phonon-polariton E-modes near 3.8 and 14.9 THz, which agrees
considerably with the theoretical phonon-polariton dispersion curves. We also
discovered that a time lag ($\Delta$t $\approx$ 0.2 ps) between the coherent
optical phonon and phonon-polariton originates from the coupling time for
propagating phonon-polariton. Our findings provide a possible application of
LiNbO$_{3}$ for ultrafast electro-optic phonon modulators with bandwidths
greater than 10 THz.

focus on system performance based on environmental, social, and economic
impacts. In contrast, resilience aspects demonstrate the ability to withstand
external shocks i.e. robustness as well as to recover from the loss of
functionality due to such disruptions i.e. rapidity. Therefore, sustainability
and resilience are two key aspects which should be given adequate attention
during the planning, design, construction, operations, and maintenance phases
of any civil infrastructure system. As both concepts are equally important to
sustain an infrastructure for a longer duration, their concurrent assessments
within a unified framework are highly desirable. While there has been a recent
focus towards solving this dilemma, review of existing studies revealed the
lack of such unifying frameworks that can quantify sustainability and
resilience indicators to simultaneously assess system performance. Moreover, a
single decision or performance indicator could reinforce one and undermine
another. As such, this study proposed a forward-looking unification framework,
where the sustainability and resilience of transportation infrastructure
systems can be analyzed simultaneously. In this regard, the proposed unifying
framework is explained using seven critical indicators including emission,
speed, temperature, energy consumption, delay, mobility, and accessibility.
This study also investigates the interdependencies, relationships, and
tradeoffs between sustainability and resilience based on these indices. While
some indices would help the system to attain both at the same time, they are
compromised in some cases. Finally, the study identifies immediate research
needs as well as the ones in the long-term.

amounts to a gradient of a scalar. The possibility that vectorial nonmetricity

features. Finally, Minkowski Tracker updates the track and its confidence score
based on the detection-to-track match probability predicted from the ROI
features. We show in large-scale experiments that the overall performance gain
of our method is due to four factors: 1. The temporal reasoning of the 4D
encoder improves the detection performance 2. The multi-task learning of object
detection and MOT jointly enhances each other 3. The detection-to-track match
score learns implicit motion model to enhance track assignment 4. The
detection-to-track match score improves the quality of the track confidence
score. As a result, Minkowski Tracker achieved the state-of-the-art performance
on Nuscenes dataset tracking task without hand-designed motion models.

this paper, using a large number of stars in the Kepler field observed by the
LAMOST survey, it has been possible to estimate the planet occurrence rate with
respect to the host star carbon abundance. Carbon abundances are derived using
synthetic spectra fit of the CH G-band region in the LAMOST spectra. The carbon
abundance trend with metallicity is consistent with the previous studies and
follows the Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). Similar to [Fe/H], we find that
the [C/H] values are higher among giant planet hosts. The trend between [C/Fe]
and [Fe/H] in planet hosts and single stars is similar; however, there is a
preference for giant planets around host stars with a sub-solar [C/Fe] ratio
and higher [Fe/H]. Higher metallicity and sub-solar [C/Fe] values are found
among younger stars as a result of GCE. Hence, based on the current sample, it
is difficult to interpret the results as a consequence of GCE or due to planet
formation.

  Approach","17 pages, 9 figures",,,,"stat.ME cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generating large-scale samples of stationary random fields is of great
importance in the fields such as geomaterial modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Traditional methodologies based on covariance matrix
decomposition have the diffculty of being computationally expensive, which is
even more serious when the dimension of the random field is large. This paper
proposes an effcient stochastic realization approach for sampling Gaussian
stationary random fields from a systems and control point of view.
Specifically, we take the exponential and Gaussian covariance functions as
examples and make a decoupling assumption when there are multiple dimensions.
Then a rational spectral density is constructed in each dimension using
techniques from covariance extension, and the corresponding autoregressive
moving-average (ARMA) model is obtained via spectral factorization. As a
result, samples of the random field with a specific covariance function can be
generated very effciently in the space domain by implementing the ARMA
recursion using a white noise input. Such a procedure is computationally cheap
due to the fact that the constructed ARMA model has a low order. Furthermore,
the same method is integrated to multiscale simulations where interpolations of
the generated samples are achieved when one zooms into finer scales. Both
theoretical analysis and simulation results show that our approach performs
favorably compared with covariance matrix decomposition methods.

not rely on computing any finite abstraction to model the system. We decompose
the GDTL specification into a sequence of reach-avoid sub-tasks. We develop a
class of fault-tolerant finite time convergence control barrier functions
(CBFs) to guarantee that a dynamical system reaches a set within finite time
almost surely in the presence of malicious attacks. We use the fault-tolerant
finite time convergence CBFs to guarantee the satisfaction of `reach' property.
We ensure `avoid' part in each sub-task using fault-tolerant zeroing CBFs.
These fault-tolerant CBFs formulate a set of linear constraints on the control
input for each sub-task. We prove that if the error incurred by system state
estimation is bounded by a certain threshold, then our synthesized controller
fulfills each reach-avoid sub-task almost surely for any possible sensor fault

We demonstrate our proposed approach using a numerical study on the

considerable attention. Recently, the technical trend of Knowledge-aware
Recommendation (KGR) is to develop end-to-end models based on graph neural
networks (GNNs). However, the extremely sparse user-item interactions
significantly degrade the performance of the GNN-based models, as: 1) the
sparse interaction, means inadequate supervision signals and limits the
supervised GNN-based models; 2) the combination of sparse interactions (CF
part) and redundant KG facts (KG part) results in an unbalanced information
utilization. Besides, the GNN paradigm aggregates local neighbors for node
representation learning, while ignoring the non-local KG facts and making the
knowledge extraction insufficient. Inspired by the recent success of
contrastive learning in mining supervised signals from data itself, in this
paper, we focus on exploring contrastive learning in KGR and propose a novel
multi-level interactive contrastive learning mechanism. Different from
traditional contrastive learning methods which contrast nodes of two generated
graph views, interactive contrastive mechanism conducts layer-wise
self-supervised learning by contrasting layers of different parts within
graphs, which is also an ""interaction"" action. Specifically, we first construct
local and non-local graphs for user/item in KG, exploring more KG facts for
KGR. Then an intra-graph level interactive contrastive learning is performed
within each graph, which contrasts layers of the CF and KG parts, for more
consistent information leveraging. Besides, an inter-graph level interactive
contrastive learning is performed between the local and non-local graphs, for
sufficiently and coherently extracting non-local KG signals. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets show the superior performance
of our proposed method over the state-of-the-arts.

complex nature of jets and the alignment of the momentum imbalance from the

perturbation theory: for sufficiently small values of a parameter $\varepsilon

constructed as perturbations of a singular heteroclinic orbit. Here we show
rigorously that these waves are spectrally stable for the case of viscous
relaxation. Our approach is to show that for sufficiently small
$\varepsilon>0$, the `full' eigenvalue problem of the regularised system is
controlled by a (reduced) slow eigenvalue problem defined for $\varepsilon =
0$. In the course of our proof, we examine the ways in which this geometric
construction complements and differs from constructions of other reduced
eigenvalue problems that are known in the wave stability literature.

improved from total lack of crosslinking near -40 degree declination to
clearing the strictest thresholds for crosslinking across the entire field. The
simulated strategies are compared to the strategies used for the Atacama

different scale from those of the amplitudes, and show it achieves a linear
rate of convergence$\unicode{x2014}$in terms of entrywise
errors$\unicode{x2014}$when initialized close to the ground truth, as long as
the separation between the true spikes is sufficiently large. However, the
convergence rate slows down significantly when the dynamic range of the source
amplitudes is large. To bridge this issue, we introduce an adaptive

sources in an iteration-varying manner based on the current estimate. The
adaptive design provably leads to an accelerated convergence rate that is

multi-task learning by incorporating both auxiliary tasks that the model should
perform well on and adversarial tasks that the model should not perform well
on. We employ Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA) as a data-driven approach for
deciding what category these tasks should fall in. Our novel proposed
framework, Adversarial Multi-Task Neural Networks (AMT), penalizes adversarial
tasks, determined by NCA to be scene recognition in the Holistic Video
Understanding (HVU) dataset, to improve action recognition. This upends the
common assumption that the model should always be encouraged to do well on all
tasks in multi-task learning. Simultaneously, AMT still retains all the
benefits of multi-task learning as a generalization of existing methods and
uses object recognition as an auxiliary task to aid action recognition. We
introduce two challenging Scene-Invariant test splits of HVU, where the model
is evaluated on action-scene co-occurrences not encountered in training. We
show that our approach improves accuracy by ~3% and encourages the model to
attend to action features instead of correlation-biasing scene features.

features of anisotropic potential energy surfaces of bulk h-BN and potentially
other layered materials. Atomistic simulations based on MLIPs are expected to
be able to greatly promote the understanding of phonon transport and the

capability into current cellular networks where multiple sensing nodes (SNs)
can collaboratively sense the same targets. Besides the active sensing in
traditional radar systems, passive sensing based on the uplink communication
signals from mobile user equipment may play a more important role in PMNs,
especially for targets with weak electromagnetic wave reflection, e.g.,
pedestrians. However, without the properly designed active sensing waveform,
passive sensing normally suffers from low signal to noise power ratio (SNR). As
a result, most existing methods require a large number of data samples to
achieve an accurate estimate of the covariance matrix for the received signals,
based on which a power spectrum is constructed for localization purposes. Such
a requirement will create heavy communication workload for PMNs because the
data samples need to be transferred over the network for collaborative sensing.
To tackle this issue, in this paper we leverage the sparse structure of the
localization problem to reduce the searching space and propose an iterative
sparse recovery (ISR) algorithm that estimates the covariance matrix and the
power spectrum in an iterative manner. Experiment results show that, with very
few samples in the low SNR regime, the ISR algorithm can achieve much better
localization performance than existing methods.

couplings $U/t=1.5-4$ in relevant temperatures $T>100{\rm K}.$ In the doping
range $\ p=0.1-0.3$, the value of $U$ is smaller than that in the parent

coupling is large compared to the effective tight binding scale and a different

a space $X$ is a systematic cover if the closure of $U_\alpha$ is contained in
$U_\beta$ when $\alpha<\beta$, and $X$ is Type I if $\kappa=\omega_1$ and the
closure of each $U_\alpha$ is Lindel\""of. A closed subspace $D\subset X$ is
narrow in $X$ if for each systematic cover $\{V_\alpha : \alpha\in\omega_1\}$
of $X$, either there is $\alpha$ such that $D$ is included in $V_\alpha$, or
the closure of $V_\alpha$ intersected with $D$ is Lindel\""of for each $\alpha$.
Taking systematic covers given by preimages by $s$ of $[0,\alpha)$ for a
continuous $s: X\to \mathbb{L}_{\ge 0}$ (where $ \mathbb{L}_{\ge 0}$ is the
longray) defines functionally Type I spaces and functionally narrow subspaces.
For instance, $ \mathbb{L}_{\ge 0}$ and $\omega_1$ are narrow in themselves and
any other space.
  We investigate these properties and relative versions, as well as their
relationship, and show in particular the following. There are functionally
Hausdorff Type I spaces which are not functionally Type I while regular Type I
spaces are functionally Type I. We exhibit examples of spaces which are narrow
in some but not in other spaces. There are subspaces of a Tychonoff space $Y$
that are functionally narrow but not narrow in $Y$, while both notions agree if
$Y$ is normal. Under PFA and using classical results, any $\omega_1$-compact
locally compact countably tight Type I space contains a non-Lindel\""of subspace
narrow in it (a copy of $\omega_1$, actually), while a Suslin tree does not.
There are spaces with subspaces narrow in them that are essentially discrete.
Finally, we investigate natural partial orders on (functionally) narrow
subspaces and when these orders are $\omega$- or $\omega_1$-closed.

  boundary fields : the case with a constraint","28 pages",,,,"math-ph cond-mat.str-el hep-th math.MP nlin.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is a continuation of [1], in which a set of matrix elements of
local operators was computed for the XXZ spin-1/2 open chain with a particular
case of unparallel boundary fields. Here, we extend these results to the more
general case in which both fields are non-longitudinal and related by one
constraint, allowing for a partial description of the spectrum by usual Bethe
equations. More precisely, the complete spectrum and eigenstates can be
characterized within the Separation of Variables (SoV) framework. One uses here
the fact that, under the constraint, a part of this SoV spectrum can be
described via solutions of a usual, homogeneous, TQ-equation, with
corresponding transfer matrix eigenstates coinciding with generalized Bethe
states. We explain how to generically compute the action of a basis of local
operators on such kind of states, and this under the most general boundary
condition on the last site of the chain. As a result, we can compute the matrix
elements of some of these basis elements in any eigenstate described by the
homogenous TQ-equation. Assuming, following a conjecture of Nepomechie and
Ravanini, that the ground state itself can be described in this framework, we
obtain multiple integral representations for these matrix elements in the
half-infinite chain limit, generalizing those previously obtained in the case
of longitudinal boundary fields and in the case of the special boundary
conditions considered in [1].

large annotated dataset. In medical data science, one of the major limitations
to develop DL models is the lack of annotated examples in large quantity. This
is most often due to the time and expertise required to annotate. We introduce
Lirot.ai, a novel platform for facilitating and crowd-sourcing image
segmentations. Methods: Lirot.ai is composed of three components; an iPadOS
client application named Lirot.ai-app, a backend server named Lirot.ai-server
and a python API name Lirot.ai-API. Lirot.ai-app was developed in Swift 5.6 and
Lirot.ai-server is a firebase backend. Lirot.ai-API allows the management of
the database. Lirot.ai-app can be installed on as many iPadOS devices as needed
so that annotators may be able to perform their segmentation simultaneously and
remotely. We incorporate Apple Pencil compatibility, making the segmentation
faster, more accurate, and more intuitive for the expert than any other
computer-based alternative. Results: We demonstrate the usage of Lirot.ai for
the creation of a retinal fundus dataset with reference vasculature
segmentations. Discussion and future work: We will use active learning
strategies to continue enlarging our retinal fundus dataset by including a more
efficient process to select the images to be annotated and distribute them to
annotators.

radiation while the accretion disk jets are normally dominated by thermal
emission. In this work, our aim is to study the connection between the two
types of emission by investigating the correlation between the blazar emission
line intensity property, which embodies the nature of accretion disk, and the
$\gamma$-ray flux property, which is the representative of jet emission. We
compiled a sample of 656 blazars with available emission line equivalent widths
($EW$), the GeV $\gamma$-ray flux, and the SED information from the literature.
In this work, we found 55 previous BCUs are now identified as FSRQs, and found
52 Changing-look blazars based on their $EW$ and 45 of them are newly
confirmed. These Changing-look blazars have a larger accretion ratio (${\dot
M}/{\dot M}_{\rm Edd}$) than BL Lac objects. In addition, we suggest that the
lower synchrotron peak blazars (LSPs) could be the source of Changing-look
blazars because 90.7\% of the Changing-look blazars in this work are confirmed
as LSPs. An anti-correlation between $EW$ and continuum intensity, the
so-called global Baldwin effect (BEff) has been confirmed. We suggest the
steeper global BEff observed for blazar than for radio-quiet active galactic
nuclei (RQ-AGNs) is caused by the inverse Compton scattering of
broad-emission-line photons. This interpretation is further supported by the
positive correlation between the emission line $EW$ and intrinsic inverse
Compton luminosity.

ranging from finite nuclei to nuclear matter and compact stars. Although with
some specific features for nuclear systems, the mechanism of pairing between
nucleons in these systems resembles that of electrons in superconductors. The
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, the first successful and microscopic
theory for superconductivity, and the Bogoliubov transformation, the
generalization of the BCS theory, have been widely used to describe pairing
correlations in nuclear systems. To deal with the problem of particle number
non-conservation in the BCS method and generalized Bogoliubov transformation,
particle number projection techniques as well as several approaches which keep
the particle number conserved, have been proposed. In the study of exotic
nuclei, which are quantum open systems, the continuum contributions have to be
taken into account. In this chapter, a thorough but brief discussion of pairing
effects in nuclear systems will be introduced. Then nuclear models dealing with
pairing correlations in nuclear structure properties will be presented to
different extent of details. Although formulas are given, the emphasis is

quantum biology, materials science, and spin chemistry. The rich quantum
physical underpinnings of the mechanism are determined by a coherent
oscillation (quantum beats) between the singlet and triplet spin states and
their interactions with the environment, which is challenging to experimentally
explore and computationally simulate. In this work, we take advantage of
quantum computers to simulate the Hamiltonian evolution and thermal relaxation
of two radical pair systems undergoing the quantum-beat phenomena. We study
radical pair systems with nontrivial hyperfine coupling interactions, namely,
9,10-octalin+/p-terphenyl-d14 and 2,3-dimethylbutane/p-terphenyl-d14 that have
one and two groups of magnetically equivalent nuclei, respectively. Thermal
relaxation dynamics in these systems are simulated using three methods: Kraus
channel representations, noise models on Qiskit Aer and the inherent qubit
noise present on the near-term quantum hardware. By leveraging the inherent
qubit noise, we are able to simulate noisy quantum beats in the two radical
pairs better than with any classical approximation or quantum simulator. While
classical simulations of paramagnetic relaxation grow errors and uncertainties
as a function of time, near-term quantum computers can match the experimental
data throughout its time evolution, showcasing their unique suitability and
future promise in simulating open quantum systems in chemistry.

the perturbed interaction network can quickly determine the coexistence
equilibrium of competing species instead of solving a large system of ordinary
differential equations. It is possible to split the system into multiple
feasible cluster states depending on the number of perturbations. Our analysis
also reveals the ratio between the unperturbed and perturbed species is
inversely proportional to the amount of employed perturbation. Our results
suggest that nonlinear dynamical systems and interaction topologies can be
interplayed to comprehend species' coexistence under adverse conditions.
Particularly our findings signify that less competition between two species

(LPWAN) method that was first launched by the 3rd generation partnership
project (3GPP) Rel- 13 with the purpose of enabling low-cost, low-power and
wide-area cellular connection for the Internet of Things (IoT). As the demand
for over-the-air services grows and with the number of linked wireless devices
reaching 100 billion, wireless spectrum is becoming scarce, necessitating
creative techniques that can increase the number of connected devices within a
restricted spectral resource in order to satisfy service needs. Consequently,
it is vital that academics develop efficient solutions to fulfill the quality
of service (QoS) criteria of the NB-IoT in the context of 5th generation (5G)
and beyond. This study paves the way for 5G networks and beyond to have
increased capacity and data rate for NB-IoT. Whereas, this article suggests a
method for increasing the number of connected devices by using a technique
known as symbol time compression (STC). The suggested method compresses the
occupied bandwidth of each device without increasing complexity, losing data
throughput or bit error rate (BER) performance. The STC approach is proposed in
the literature to work with the conventional orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) to reduce bandwidth usage by 50% and improve the
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Specifically, An STC-based method is
proposed that exploits the unused bandwidth to double the number of connected
devices while keeping system performance and complexity. Furthermore, the
{\mu}-law companding technique is leveraged to reduce the PAPR of the
transmitted signals. The obtained simulation results reveal that the proposed
approach using the {\mu}-law companding technique increases the transmitted
data by twice and reduces the PAPR by 3.22 dB while maintaining the same
complexity and BER.

with carbon clusters, some of which may have been formed by the destruction of
solid carbon phases by the impacting laser. We show that the detected
fullerenes are not formed in this way. We suggest that fullerenes are an
intrinsic component of a specific carbon phase that has yet to be identified.
The nondetection of fullerenes in the Murchison and Allende bulk samples, while
using the same experimental conditions, suggests that this phase is absent or
less abundant in these primitive chondrites. The former case would support the
formation of fullerenes by shock-wave processing of carbonaceous phases in the

caption can describe up to 178 images. These large matching-lost data not only
confuse the model in training but also weaken the evaluation accuracy. Inspired
by visual and textual entailment tasks, we propose a multi-modal entailment
classifier to determine whether a sentence is entailed by an image plus its
linked captions. Subsequently, we revise the image-text retrieval datasets by
adding these entailed captions as additional weak labels of an image and
develop a universal variable learning rate strategy to teach a retrieval model
to distinguish the entailed captions from other negative samples. In
experiments, we manually annotate an entailment-corrected image-text retrieval
dataset for evaluation. The results demonstrate that the proposed entailment
classifier achieves about 78% accuracy and consistently improves the
performance of image-text retrieval baselines.

novel Sequential Weighted Expectation-Maximization (SWEM) network to greatly
reduce the redundancy of memory features. Different from the previous methods
which only detect feature redundancy between frames, SWEM merges both
intra-frame and inter-frame similar features by leveraging the sequential
weighted EM algorithm. Further, adaptive weights for frame features endow SWEM
with the flexibility to represent hard samples, improving the discrimination of
templates. Besides, the proposed method maintains a fixed number of template
features in memory, which ensures the stable inference complexity of the VOS
system. Extensive experiments on commonly used DAVIS and YouTube-VOS datasets
verify the high efficiency (36 FPS) and high performance (84.3\%

magnetic field in solar flare plasmas. Analyzing observed zebra stripes and
assuming their generation by the double-plasma resonance (DPR) instability,
high values of the gyro-harmonic number are found. In some cases, they exceed
one hundred, in disagreement with the DPR growth rates computed up to now,
which decrease with increasing gyro-harmonic number. We address the question of
how the zebras with high values of the gyro-harmonic numbers $s$ are generated.
For this purpose, we compute growth rates of the DPR instability in a very
broad range of $s$, considering a loss-cone $\kappa$-distribution of
superthermal electrons and varying the loss-cone angle, electron energies, and
background plasma temperature. We numerically calculated dispersion relations
and growth rates of the upper-hybrid waves and found that the growth rates
increase with increasing gyro-harmonic numbers if the loss-cone angles are
$\sim80^\circ$. The highest growth rates for these loss-cone angles are
obtained for the velocity $v_\kappa = 0.15\,c$. The growth rates as function of
the gyro-harmonic number still show well distinct peaks, which correspond to
zebra-stripe frequencies. The contrast of the growth rate peaks to surrounding
growth rate levels increases as the $\kappa$ index increases and the background
temperature decreases. Zebras with high values of $s$ can be generated in
regions where loss-cone distributions of superthermal electrons with large
loss-cone angles ($\sim80^\circ$) are present. Furthermore, owing to the high
values of $s$, the magnetic field is relatively weak and has a small spatial
gradient in such regions.

However, as the size of an $N$-player game typically grows exponentially with
$N$, standard game theoretic analysis becomes effectively infeasible beyond a
low number of players. Recent approaches have gone around this limitation by
instead considering Mean-Field games, an approximation of anonymous $N$-player
games, where the number of players is infinite and the population's state
distribution, instead of every individual player's state, is the object of
interest. The practical computability of Mean-Field Nash equilibria, the most
studied Mean-Field equilibrium to date, however, typically depends on
beneficial non-generic structural properties such as monotonicity or
contraction properties, which are required for known algorithms to converge. In
this work, we provide an alternative route for studying Mean-Field games, by
developing the concepts of Mean-Field correlated and coarse-correlated
equilibria. We show that they can be efficiently learnt in \emph{all games},
without requiring any additional assumption on the structure of the game, using
three classical algorithms. Furthermore, we establish correspondences between
our notions and those already present in the literature, derive optimality
bounds for the Mean-Field - $N$-player transition, and empirically demonstrate
the convergence of these algorithms on simple games.

To explore the maximum initial tilting angle of the ballbot, the balancing

adapt pre-trained visual foundation models to various downstream tasks of
semantic segmentation. Previous methods usually fine-tuned the entire networks
for each specific dataset, which will be burdensome to store massive parameters
of these networks. A few recent works attempted to insert some extra trainable
parameters into the frozen networks to learn visual prompts for
parameter-efficient tuning. However, these works showed poor generality as they
were designed specifically for Transformers. Moreover, using limited
information in these schemes, they exhibited a poor capacity to learn
beneficial prompts. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel Stage-wise
Prompt-Matched Framework for generic and effective visual prompt tuning.
Specifically, to ensure generality, we divide the pre-trained backbone with
frozen parameters into multiple stages and perform prompt learning between
different stages, which makes the proposed scheme applicable to various
architectures of CNN and Transformer. For effective tuning, a lightweight
Semantic-aware Prompt Matcher (SPM) is designed to progressively learn
reasonable prompts with a recurrent mechanism, guided by the rich information
of interim semantic maps. Working as deep matched filter of representation
learning, the proposed SPM can well transform the output of the previous stage
into a desirable input for the next stage, thus achieving the better
matching/stimulating for the pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve a promising
trade-off between parameter efficiency and performance effectiveness. Our code

fine-tunes few parameters of additional soft prompt, shows competitive
performance against full-parameter fine-tuning (i.e.model-tuning) when the PLM
has billions of parameters, but still performs poorly in the case of smaller
PLMs. Hence, prompt transfer (PoT), which initializes the target prompt with
the trained prompt of similar source tasks, is recently proposed to improve
over prompt-tuning. However, such a vanilla PoT approach usually achieves
sub-optimal performance, as (i) the PoT is sensitive to the similarity of
source-target pair and (ii) directly fine-tuning the prompt initialized with
source prompt on target task might lead to catastrophic forgetting of source
knowledge. In response to these problems, we propose a new metric to accurately
predict the prompt transferability (regarding (i)), and a novel PoT approach
(namely PANDA) that leverages the knowledge distillation technique to transfer
the ""knowledge"" from the source prompt to the target prompt in a subtle manner
and alleviate the catastrophic forgetting effectively (regarding (ii)).
Furthermore, to achieve adaptive prompt transfer for each source-target pair,
we use our metric to control the knowledge transfer in our PANDA approach.
Extensive and systematic experiments on 189 combinations of 21 source and 9
target datasets across 5 scales of PLMs demonstrate that: 1) our proposed
metric works well to predict the prompt transferability; 2) our PANDA
consistently outperforms the vanilla PoT approach by 2.3% average score (up to

filter malicious inputs. Private FLAME/FLGUARD (USENIX '22) gives a solution to
guarantee both robustness and updates confidentiality in the semi-honest

malicious context, robustness, and updates confidentiality. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel Byzantine-robust and privacy-preserving FL system,
called BRIEF, to capture malicious minority and majority for server and client
sides. Specifically, based on the DBSCAN algorithm, we design a new method for
clustering via pairwise adjusted cosine similarity to boost the accuracy of the

algorithm called Model Segmentation, where local updates in the same cluster
are aggregated together, and the aggregations are sent back to corresponding
clients correctly. We also leverage multiple cryptographic tools to conduct
clustering tasks without sacrificing training correctness and updates
confidentiality. We present detailed security proof and empirical evaluation

that the testing accuracy of BRIEF is practically close to the FL baseline
(0.8% gap on average). At the same time, the attack success rate is around
0%-5%. We further optimize our design so that the communication overhead and
runtime can be decreased by {67%-89.17% and 66.05%-68.75%}, respectively.

long follow-up period, which is difficult to meet in randomized clinical trials

assessing the drug effect relies on stringent assumptions that empirical
studies often fail to satisfy. Motivated by a kidney disease study, we
investigate the drug effects on long-term outcomes by combining an RCT without
observation of long-term outcome and an observational study in which the
long-term outcome is observed but unmeasured confounding may exist. Under a
mean exchangeability assumption weaker than the previous literature, we
identify the average treatment effects in the RCT and derive the associated
efficient influence function and semiparametric efficiency bound. Furthermore,
we propose a locally efficient doubly robust estimator and an inverse
probability weighted (IPW) estimator. The former attains the semiparametric
efficiency bound if all the working models are correctly specified. The latter
has a simpler form and requires much fewer model specifications. The IPW
estimator using estimated propensity scores is more efficient than that using
true propensity scores and achieves the semiparametric efficient bound in the
case of discrete covariates and surrogates with finite support. Both estimators
are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Extensive
simulations are conducted to evaluate the finite-sample performance of the
proposed estimators. We apply the proposed methods to estimate the efficacy of

curvilinear coordinates and show that the ensemble and volume averages can be
approximately equated, but this depends on our choice of definition of the
volume average of a tensor and the radial distance between the observer and
field. We then extract the tensor Minkowski functionals from spherically
redshift space distorted, Gaussian random fields and gravitationally evolved
dark matter density fields at $z=0$ to test if we can successfully measure the

connectivity queries under vertex faults. For a given $n$-vertex graph $G$, an
$f$-VFT (resp., EFT) connectivity labeling scheme is a distributed data
structure that assigns each of the graph edges and vertices a short label, such
that given the labels of a vertex pair $u$ and $v$, and the labels of at most
$f$ failing vertices (resp., edges) $F$, one can determine if $u$ and $v$ are
connected in $G \setminus F$. The primary complexity measure is the length of
the individual labels. Since their introduction by [Courcelle, Twigg, STACS
'07], FT labeling schemes have been devised only for a limited collection of
graph families. A recent work [Dory and Parter, PODC 2021] provided EFT
labeling schemes for general graphs under edge failures, leaving the vertex
failure case fairly open. We provide the first sublinear $f$-VFT labeling
schemes for $f \geq 2$ for any $n$-vertex graph. Our key result is $2$-VFT
connectivity labels with $O(\log^3 n)$ bits. Our constructions are based on
analyzing the structure of dual failure replacement paths on top of the
well-known heavy-light tree decomposition technique of [Sleator and Tarjan,

Semantic Segmentation, most of its recent successes are involved in unwieldy

existing knowledge distillation techniques pay more attention to pixel-level

unlabeled data into account. Consequently, we offer the first attempt to
provide lightweight SSSS models via a novel multi-granularity distillation
(MGD) scheme, where multi-granularity is captured from three aspects: i)
complementary teacher structure; ii) labeled-unlabeled data cooperative
distillation; iii) hierarchical and multi-levels loss setting. Specifically,
MGD is formulated as a labeled-unlabeled data cooperative distillation scheme,
which helps to take full advantage of diverse data characteristics that are
essential in the semi-supervised setting. Image-level semantic-sensitive loss,
region-level content-aware loss, and pixel-level consistency loss are set up to
enrich hierarchical distillation abstraction via structurally complementary
teachers. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC2012 and Cityscapes reveal that MGD
can outperform the competitive approaches by a large margin under diverse
partition protocols. For example, the performance of ResNet-18 and MobileNet-v2
backbone is boosted by 11.5% and 4.6% respectively under 1/16 partition
protocol on Cityscapes. Although the FLOPs of the model backbone is compressed
by 3.4-5.3x (ResNet-18) and 38.7-59.6x (MobileNetv2), the model manages to
achieve satisfactory segmentation results.

of strongly lensed FRBs on simultaneously estimating these two parameters via

which the luminosity rises by a factor $\sim$10$-$1000 in a few hours to then
decay over months/years. Outbursts often exhibit a thermal spectrum, associated
with the appearance of hotter regions on the surface of the star, which
subsequently change in shape and cool down. Here we simulate the unfolding of a
sudden, localized heat injection in the external crust of a NS with a 3D
magneto-thermal evolution code, finding that this can reproduce the main

for the solid state laser which consists of the Maxwell equations coupled to
$N\sim 10^{20}$ Schr\""odinger equations for active molecules. The system
contains time-periodic pumping and a weak dissipation. We introduce the
corresponding Poincar\'e map $P$ and consider the differential $DP(Y^0)$ at
suitable stationary state $Y^0$. We conjecture that the {\it stable laser
action} is due to the {\it parametric resonance} (PR) which means that the
maximal absolute value of the corresponding multipliers is greater than one.
The multipliers are defined as eigenvalues of $DP(Y^0)$. The PR makes the
stationary state $Y^0$ highly unstable, and we suppose that this instability
maintains the {\it coherent laser radiation}.
  We prove that the spectrum Spec$\,DP(Y^0)$ is approximately symmetric with
respect to the unit circle $|\mu|=1$ if the dissipation is sufficiently small.
More detailed results are obtained for the Maxwell--Bloch system. We calculate
the corresponding Poincar\'e map $P$ by successive approximations. The key role
in calculation of the multipliers is played by the sum of $N$ positive terms
arising in the second-order approximation for the total current. This fact can
be interpreted as the {\it synchronization of molecular currents} in all active
molecules, which is provisionally in line with the role of {\it stimulated
emission} in the laser action. The calculation of the sum relies on
probabilistic arguments which is one of main novelties of our approach. Other
main novelties are i) the calculation of the differential $DP(Y^0)$ in the
""Hopf representation"", ii) the block structure of the differential, and iii)
the justification of the ""rotating wave approximation"" by a new estimate for

valuation of a general class of GMWB annuities, allowing for step-up, bonus and
surrender features, taking also into account mortality risk and death benefits.
When dynamic withdrawals are allowed, the valuation of GMWB annuities leads to
a stochastic optimal control problem, which we address here by dynamic
programming techniques. Adopting a Hull-White interest rate model, correlated
with the equity fund, we propose an efficient tree-based algorithm. We perform
a thorough analysis of the determinants of the market value of GMWB annuities
and of the optimal withdrawal strategies. In particular, we study the impact of
a low/negative interest rate environment. Our findings indicate that
low/negative rates profoundly affect the optimal withdrawal behaviour and, in
combination with step-up and bonus features, increase significantly the fair
values of GMWB annuities, which can only be compensated by large management
fees.

the magnetic field-driven collapse of a room temperature metastable topological
skyrmion lattice passes through a regime described by a partial topological
charge inversion. Using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, the
magnetization distribution was observed directly as the magnetic field was
swept antiparallel to the original skyrmion core magnetization, i.e. negative
magnetic fields. Due to the topological stability of skyrmions, a direct
transition of the metastable skyrmion lattice to the equilibrium helical state
is avoided for increasingly negative fields. Instead, the metastable skyrmion
lattice gradually transforms into giant magnetic bubbles separated by $2\pi$
domain walls. Eventually these large structures give way to form a
near-homogeneously magnetized medium that unexpectedly hosts a low density of
isolated skyrmions with inverted core magnetization, and thus a total
topological charge of reduced size and opposite sign compared with the initial
state. A similar phenomenon has been observed previously in systems hosting
ordered lattices of magnetic bubbles stabilized by the dipolar interaction and
called ""topological melting"". With support from numerical calculations, we
argue that the observed regime of partial topological charge inversion has its
origin in the topological protection of the starting metastable skyrmion state.

Another well-studied G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) containing 7
transmembrane (TM) helices is the B2 adrenergic receptor (B2AR), for which
energy dissipation paths have been linked with allosteric communication. To
study the vibrational energy transport in the active and inactive states of
these GPCRs, a master equation approach [J. Chem. Phys. 152, 045103 (2020)] is
employed, which uses scaling rules that allow to calculate energy transport
rates solely based on the protein structure. Despite their structural
similarities, the three GPCRs reveal quite different strategies to redistribute
excess energy. While bR quickly removes the energy using the TM7 helix as a
""lightning rod"", Rho exhibits a rather poor energy dissipation, which might
eventually require the hydrolysis of the Schiff base between the protein and
the retinal chromophore to prevent overheating. Heating the ligand adrenaline
of B2AR, the resulting energy transport network of the protein is found to
change significantly upon switching from the active to the inactive state.
While the energy flow may highlight aspects of the interresidue couplings of
B2AR, it seems not particularly suited to explain allosteric phenomena.

various benefits to a recommender system. For example, it becomes less likely
that a system overlooks categories with less interaction on a user's profile by
only recommending popular categories. Despite the notable success, calibration

manifold by the manifold in latent space. A good regularity and structure of
the embedded manifold may substantially simplify further data processing tasks
such as cluster analysis or data interpolation. We propose and analyze a novel
regularization for learning the encoder component of an autoencoder: a loss
functional that prefers isometric, extrinsically flat embeddings and allows to
train the encoder on its own. To perform the training it is assumed that for
pairs of nearby points on the input manifold their local Riemannian distance
and their local Riemannian average can be evaluated. The loss functional is
computed via Monte Carlo integration with different sampling strategies for
pairs of points on the input manifold. Our main theorem identifies a geometric
loss functional of the embedding map as the $\Gamma$-limit of the
sampling-dependent loss functionals. Numerical tests, using image data that
encodes different explicitly given data manifolds, show that smooth manifold
embeddings into latent space are obtained. Due to the promotion of extrinsic
flatness, these embeddings are regular enough such that interpolation between
not too distant points on the manifold is well approximated by linear
interpolation in latent space as one possible postprocessing.

want to remedy this by exploring large grids of detailed binary and single star
evolution models computed with the publicly available MESA code, for a
metallicity appropriate for the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The binary models
are calculated through Roche-lobe overflow and mass transfer, until the
initially more massive star exhausts helium in its core. We distinguish models
of WR and helium stars based on the estimated stellar wind optical depth. We
use these models to build a synthetic WR population, assuming constant star
formation. Our models can reproduce the WR population of the LMC to significant
detail, including the number and luminosity functions of the main WR subtypes.
We find that for binary fractions of 100% (50%), all LMC WR stars below
$10^6\,L_{\odot}$ ($10^{5.7}\,L_{\odot}$) are stripped binary mass donors. We
also identify several insightful mismatches. With a single star fraction of
50\%, our models produce too many yellow supergiants, calling either for a
larger initial binary fraction, or for enhanced mass-loss near the
Humphreys-Davidson limit. Our models predict more long-period WR binaries than
observed, arguably due to an observational bias towards short periods. Our
models also underpredict the shortest-period WR binaries, which may have
implications for understanding the progenitors of double black hole mergers.
The fraction of binary produced WR stars may be larger than often assumed, and

studies by the uncertainty in the evaluation of the power conversion
efficiency, while currently, potential links to degradation mechanisms are in

addressed by performing a combined large- and small signal analysis. The
reported large capacitive and inductive effects created controversies with
respect to the underlying mechanisms, yielding essentially two classes of
models, one based on large accumulation capacitances and the other based on
ionic modulation of the collected current. We introduce here an equivalent

modulation, identifying the distinct contributions from ion current and ionic

associated with capacitive and inductive effects, respectively, and we
corroborate the numerical simulations with electrochemical impedance

currents of photogenerated carriers in producing both capacitive and inductive
effects as the illumination is varied. Moreover, we provide a bridging point

assign an expert GNN model to each subset of nodes that are split in a balanced

trained an expert for each balanced subset, we adopt knowledge distillation to
obtain two class-wise students, i.e., Head class student and Tail class
student, each of which is responsible for classifying nodes in the head classes

effectiveness (SE). The SE was measured with probes on a test bench system. In
addition, the PET detector performance was evaluated by determining the
positioning using gradient tree boosting, energy and timing resolution using
digital SiPM arrays (DPC3200, PDPC) in three LYSO scintillator configurations:
ESR separation (Slab$\mathrm{_{ESR}}$), ESR with copper foil in between
(Slab$\mathrm{_{ESR+Cu}}$), and purely copper foil separation
(Slab$\mathrm{_{Cu}}$). The prototype with shielding between each slab and 12
mm height showed the highest SE with 31 dB (mean) in combination with a
supporting frame. While Slab$\mathrm{_{Cu}}$ was best for positioning, followed
by Slab$\mathrm{_{ESR}}$ and Slab$\mathrm{_{ESR+Cu}}$, the

The scintillator-based RF shielding shows good RF shielding with similar PET

dedicated radio imaging-spectroscopic telescope, has realized high-time,
high-angular, and high-frequency resolution imaging of the sun over an
ultra-broadband frequency range. Each pair of MUSER antennas measures the
complex visibility in the aperture plane for each integration time and
frequency channel. The corresponding radio image for each integration time and
frequency channel is then obtained by inverse Fourier transformation of the
visibility data. In general, the phase of the complex visibility is severely
corrupted by instrumental and propagation effects. Therefore, robust
calibration procedures are vital in order to obtain high-fidelity radio images.
While there are many calibration techniques available -- e.g., using redundant
baselines, observing standard cosmic sources, or fitting the solar disk -- to
correct the visibility data for the above-mentioned phase errors, MUSER is
configured with non-redundant baselines and the solar disk structure cannot
always be exploited. Therefore it is desirable to develop alternative
calibration methods in addition to these available techniques whenever
appropriate for MUSER to obtain reliable radio images. In the case that a
point-like calibration source containing an unknown position error, we have for
the first time derived a mathematical model to describe the problem and
proposed an optimization method to calibrate this unknown error by studying the
offset of the positions of radio images over a certain period of the time
interval. Simulation experiments and actual observational data analyses
indicate that this method is valid and feasible. For MUSER's practical data the
calibrated position errors are within the spatial angular resolution of the
instrument. This calibration method can also be used in other situations for

initial site $ x_0 $ and, with fixed probability $ r $, at each step may be

a series of results regarding the first and the second moment of the first
hitting time distribution, valid for a wide class of processes, including
random walks lacking the property of translational invariance; we then apply
these results to the specific model. When resetting is not applied, by tuning
the value of a parameter which defines the transition probability of the
process, denoted by $ \epsilon $, the recurrence properties of the walk are
changed, and we can observe: a transient walk, a null-recurrent walk, or a
positive-recurrent walk. When the resetting mechanism is switched on, we study
quantitatively in all regimes the improvement of the search efficiency. In
particular, in every case resetting allows the system to reach the target with
probability one and, on average, in a finite time. If the reset-free system is
in the transient or null-recurrent regime, this makes resetting always
advantageous and moreover, it assures the existence of an optimal resetting
probability $ r^* $ which minimizes the mean first hitting time. Instead, when
the system is positive-recurrent, the introduction of resetting is not
necessarily beneficial. We explain that in this case there exists a threshold $
r_{\mathrm{th}} $ for the resetting probability $ r $, above which the

  Facial Expression Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The real-world facial expression recognition (FER) datasets suffer from noisy
annotations due to crowd-sourcing, ambiguity in expressions, the subjectivity
of annotators and inter-class similarity. However, the recent deep networks
have strong capacity to memorize the noisy annotations leading to corrupted
feature embedding and poor generalization. To handle noisy annotations, we
propose a dynamic FER learning framework (DNFER) in which clean samples are
selected based on dynamic class specific threshold during training.
Specifically, DNFER is based on supervised training using selected clean
samples and unsupervised consistent training using all the samples. During
training, the mean posterior class probabilities of each mini-batch is used as
dynamic class-specific threshold to select the clean samples for supervised
training. This threshold is independent of noise rate and does not need any
clean data unlike other methods. In addition, to learn from all samples, the
posterior distributions between weakly-augmented image and strongly-augmented
image are aligned using an unsupervised consistency loss. We demonstrate the
robustness of DNFER on both synthetic as well as on real noisy annotated FER
datasets like RAFDB, FERPlus, SFEW and AffectNet.

both generic and compact and enables us to process every possible CSP instance
with one GNN, regardless of constraint arity, relations or domain size. Unlike
previous RL-based methods, we operate on a global search action space and allow

significance $\xi > 6.0$ from the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev Zel'dovich

VLT/FORS2 in $U_\mathrm{HIGH}$ to preferentially select background galaxies at
$z\gtrsim 1.8$, achieving a high purity. We combined recent redshift estimates
from the CANDELS/3D-HST and HUDF fields to infer an improved estimate of the
source redshift distribution. We measured weak lensing masses by fitting the
tangential reduced shear profiles with spherical Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)
models. We obtained the largest lensing mass in our sample for the cluster
SPT-CLJ2040$-$4451, thereby confirming earlier results that suggest a high
lensing mass of this cluster compared to X-ray and SZ mass measurements.
Combining our weak lensing mass constraints with results obtained by previous
studies for lower redshift clusters, we extended the calibration of the scaling
relation between the unbiased SZ detection significance $\zeta$ and the cluster
mass for the SPT-SZ survey out to higher redshifts. We found that the mass
scale inferred from our highest redshift bin ($1.2 < z < 1.7$) is consistent
with an extrapolation of constraints derived from lower redshifts, albeit with
large statistical uncertainties. Thus, our results show a similar tendency as
found in previous studies, where the cluster mass scale derived from the weak
lensing data is lower than the mass scale expected in a Planck $\nu\Lambda$CDM

number counts.

which converts continuous-time signals into streams of trigger times. This
gives rise to Event-Driven Sampling (EDS) models. The data-driven nature of EDS
acquisition is advantageous in terms of power consumption and time resolution
and is inspired by the information representation in biological nervous
systems. If an analog signal is outside a predefined dynamic range, then EDS
generates a low density of trigger times, which in turn leads to recovery
distortion due to aliasing. In this paper, inspired by the Unlimited Sensing
Framework (USF), we propose a new EDS architecture that incorporates a modulo
nonlinearity prior to acquisition that we refer to as the modulo EDS or MEDS.
In MEDS, the modulo nonlinearity folds high dynamic range inputs into low
dynamic range amplitudes, thus avoiding recovery distortion. In particular, we
consider the asynchronous sigma-delta modulator (ASDM), previously used for low
power analog-to-digital conversion. This novel MEDS based acquisition is
enabled by a recent generalization of the modulo nonlinearity called
modulo-hysteresis. We design a mathematically guaranteed recovery algorithm for
bandlimited inputs based on a sampling rate criterion and provide
reconstruction error bounds. We go beyond numerical experiments and also
provide a first hardware validation of our approach, thus bridging the gap

demonstrate that using a few example networks, the community structure changes

variety of partially synchronized patterns: oscillators with similar natural
frequencies tend to synchronize for weak coupling, while tightly connected
oscillators tend to synchronize for strong coupling. We obtain approximate
expressions for the critical coupling strengths by employing a perturbative
approach in a weak coupling regime and a geometric approach in a strong
coupling regimes. Moreover, we elucidate the bifurcation types of transitions

au, which is often attributed to a migration trap at the inner rim of
protoplanetary disks where a positive co-rotation torque prevents inward
migration. We argue that conditions in inner disk regions are such that
sub-Neptunes are likely to open gaps, lose the support of the co-rotation
torque as their co-rotation regions become depleted, and the trapping
efficiency then becomes uncertain. We study what it takes to trap such
gap-opening planets at the inner disk rim. We performed 2D locally isothermal
and non-isothermal hydrodynamic simulations of planet migration. A viscosity
transition was introduced in the disk to (i) create a density drop and (ii)
mimic the viscosity increase as the planet migrated from a dead zone towards a
region with active magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We chose TOI-216b as a
Neptune-like upper-limit test case, but we also explored different planetary
masses, both on fixed and evolving orbits. For planet-to-star mass ratios
$q\simeq(4$-$8)\times10^{-5}$, the density drop at the disk rim becomes
reshaped due to a gap opening and is often replaced with a small density bump
centered on the planet's corotation. Trapping is possible only if the bump
retains enough gas mass and if the co-rotation region becomes azimuthally
asymmetric, with an island of librating streamlines that accumulate a gas
overdensity ahead of the planet. The overdensity exerts a positive torque that
can counteract the negative torque of spiral arms. In our model, efficient
trapping depends on the $\alpha$ viscosity and its contrast across the
viscosity transition. In order to trap TOI-216b, $\alpha_{\mathrm{DZ}}=10^{-3}$
in the dead zone requires $\alpha_{\mathrm{MRI}}\gtrsim5\times10^{-2}$ in the
MRI-active zone. If $\alpha_{\mathrm{DZ}}=5\times10^{-4}$,
$\alpha_{\mathrm{MRI}}\gtrsim7.5\times10^{-2}$ is needed.

for the first time, presents a comprehensive examination of the waveform design

delves deeply into the waveform design of alternatives to LoRa. The CSS schemes

multiple chirps, and multiple chirps with index modulation, based on the number
of activated frequency shifts activated for un-chirped symbols. The transceiver
architecture of these schemes is thoroughly explicated. Additionally, we
propose coherent/non-coherent detection mechanisms for specific schemes that

performance of the schemes is evaluated based on metrics such as EE, spectral

single fillers in PC results in higher Seebeck coefficients and similar

with hybrid filler systems in PEEK composites, higher power factors could be
reached than in single filler composites. Moreover, the PC-based composites are

convergence of variational quantum algorithms. In literature, many optimizers,
each having its own architecture, have been employed expediently for different
applications. In this work, we consider a few popular optimizers and assess
their performance in variational quantum algorithms for applications in quantum
chemistry in a realistic noisy setting. We benchmark the optimizers with
critical analysis based on quantum simulations of simple molecules, such as
Hydrogen, Lithium Hydride, Beryllium Hydride, water, and Hydrogen Fluoride. The
errors in the ground-state energy, dissociation energy, and dipole moment are
the parameters used as yardsticks. All the simulations were carried out with an
ideal quantum circuit simulator, a noisy quantum circuit simulator, and a noisy
simulator with noise embedded from the IBM Cairo quantum device to understand
the performance of the classical optimizers in ideal and realistic quantum
environments. We used the standard unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz for
simulations, and the number of qubits varied from two, starting from the
Hydrogen molecule to ten qubits, in Hydrogen Fluoride. Based on the performance
of these optimizers in the ideal quantum circuits, the conjugate gradient (CG),
limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno bound (L_BFGS)B), and
sequential least squares programming (SLSQP) optimizers are found to be the
best-performing gradient-based optimizers. While constrained optimization by

buckle, propeller, opening) and/or the six translational parameters (shift,
slide, rise, shear, stretch, stagger). The algorithm enables the use of
advanced sampling techniques to probe the structure and dynamics of locally

deconvolution of the estimated composed error terms into noise and
inefficiency. Assuming a parametric production function (e.g. Cobb-Douglas,
Translog, etc.), might lead to false inefficiency estimates. To overcome this
limiting assumption, the production function can be modelled utilizing
P-splines. Application of this powerful and flexible tool enables modelling of
a wide range of production functions. Additionally, one can allow the
parameters of the composed error distribution to depend on covariates in a
functional form. The SF model can then be cast into the framework of a
Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS). Furthermore,
a decision-making unit (DMU) typically produces multiple outputs. It does this
by operating several sub-DMUs, which each employ a production process to
produce a single output. Therefore, the production processes of the sub-DMUs
are typically not independent. Consequently, the inefficiencies may be expected
to be dependent, too. In this paper, the Distributional Stochastic Frontier
Model (DSFM) is introduced. The multivariate distribution of the composed error
term is modeled using a copula. As a result, the presented model is a
generalization of the model for seemingly unrelated stochastic frontier
regressions by Lai and Huang (2013).

based on implicit and explicit expert knowledge, making it difficult to define

method with an aim to alleviate the computation and/or communication burden of

behavior along with the communication characteristics for designing the
event-trigger policy. This paper attempts to solve this challenge by proposing
an efficient eMPC framework and demonstrate successful implementation of this
framework on the autonomous vehicle path following. First of all, a model-free
reinforcement learning (RL) agent is used to learn the optimal event-trigger
policy without the need for a complete dynamical system and communication
knowledge in this framework. Furthermore, techniques including prioritized
experience replay (PER) buffer and long-short term memory (LSTM) are employed
to foster exploration and improve training efficiency. In this paper, we use
the proposed framework with three deep RL algorithms, i.e., Double Q-learning
(DDQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), to
solve this problem. Experimental results show that all three deep RL-based eMPC
(deep-RL-eMPC) can achieve better evaluation performance than the conventional
threshold-based and previous linear Q-based approach in the autonomous path
following. In particular, PPO-eMPC with LSTM and DDQN-eMPC with PER and LSTM

be a nodal-line semimetal, where ultra-flat bands are expected to emerge in
magnetic fields parallel to the nodal-line plane. Here we report that in very
low carrier-density samples of ZrTe$_5$, when the current and the magnetic
field are both along the crystallographic $a$ axis, the current-voltage
characteristics presents a pronounced nonlinearity which tends to saturate in
the ultra quantum limit. The magnetic-field dependence of the nonlinear
coefficient is well explained by the Boltzmann theory for flat-band transport,
and we argue that this nonlinear transport is likely due to the combined effect
of flat bands and charge puddles, the latter appear due to very low carrier
densities.

suppression, which reduces the dynamic range of the Fast Fourier Transform
spectrometers (FFTS), and implement this procedure in the Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) of the FFTS. This is achieved by applying a calibration on
the complex amplitude spectrum. Modern multi-beam heterodyne receivers are
equipped with a large number of independent signal chains, which leads to a
complex system that consumes space as well as power and is expensive. To reduce
the complexity of the receiver array the intermediate frequency (IF) band is
4-8 GHz, which requires the FFTS to sample this band directly.
  The input bandwidth of 4 GHz of the current generation of FFTS cannot be
sampled with a single analog-digital converter (ADC). To reach that bandwidth,
multiple ADCs sample the same signal at different points in time. The method is
called \""time interleaved sampling\"". The characteristics of the ADCs differ
from each other, which leads to mirror signals in the spectrum. These mirror
signals can reduce the dynamic range of the spectrometers. Therefore the
mismatches must be actively corrected. The current generation of FFTS use a
frequency independent calibration, which optimizes the mirror suppression at
one fixed frequency. This it is not optimal as some of the mismatches are
frequency dependent and their impact increases with frequency.
  The procedure developed during this thesis work involves three steps. First
the mismatches are measured over the frequency band. Then filter coefficients
are calculated from these mismatches using a model of a time interleaved ADC.
These filter coefficients are then applied to the complex amplitude spectra of
the ADCs. The newly implemented calibration improves the mirror suppression up
to 20 dB compared to the frequency independent calibration.

algorithm for the quantum generalisation of information bottleneck. Our
algorithm excels in the speed and the definiteness of convergence compared with
prior results. It also works for a much broader range of problems, including
the quantum extension of deterministic information bottleneck, an important
variant of the original information bottleneck problem. Notably, we discover
that a quantum system can achieve strictly better performance than a classical
system of the same size regarding quantum information bottleneck, providing new
vision on justifying the advantage of quantum machine learning.

weakly ferromagnetic whereas the third-neighbor interaction (J$_3$) is
unusually strong and antiferromagnetic driven by indirect superexchange

orbiting the bright M3.0V star TOI-1468 (LSPM J0106+1913), whose transit
signals were detected in the photometric time series in three sectors of the
TESS mission. We confirm the e planetary nature of both of them using precise
radial velocity measurements from the CARMENES and MAROON-X spectrographs, and
supplement them with ground-based transit photometry. A joint analysis of all
these data reveals that the shorter-period planet, TOI-1468 b ($P_{\rm b}$ =
1.88 d), has a planetary mass of $M_{\rm b} = 3.21\pm0.24$ $M_{\oplus}$ and a
radius of $R_{\rm b} =1.280^{+0.038}_{-0.039} R_{\oplus}$, resulting in a
density of $\rho_{\rm b} = 8.39^{+ 1.05}_{- 0.92}$ g cm$^{-3}$, which is
consistent with a mostly rocky composition. For the outer planet, TOI-1468 c
($P_{\rm c} = 15.53$ d), we derive a mass of $M_{\rm c} = 6.64^{+ 0.67}_{-
0.68}$ $M_{\oplus}$, a radius of $R_{\rm c} = 2.06\pm0.04\,R_{\oplus}$, and a
bulk density of $\rho_{c} = 2.00^{+ 0.21}_{- 0.19}$ g cm$^{-3}$, which
corresponds to a rocky core composition with a H/He gas envelope. These planets
are located on opposite sides of the radius valley, making our system an
interesting discovery as there are only a handful of other systems with the

location of the radius valley for small planets around M dwarfs and, therefore,
shed more light on planet formation and evolution scenarios.

model has become the preferred tool for predicting a wide range of cracking
phenomena. However, in its conventional form, its intrinsic tension-compression
symmetry in damage evolution prevents its application to the modelling of
compressive failures in brittle and quasi-brittle solids, such as concrete or
rock materials. In this work, we present a general methodology for decomposing
the phase field fracture driving force, the strain energy density, so as to
reproduce asymmetrical tension-compression fracture behaviour. The generalised
approach presented is particularised to the case of linear elastic solids and
the Drucker-Prager failure criterion. The ability of the presented model to
capture the compressive failure of brittle materials is showcased by
numerically implementing the resulting strain energy split formulation and
addressing four case studies of particular interest. Firstly, insight is gained
into the capabilities of the model in predicting friction and dilatancy effects
under shear loading. Secondly, virtual direct shear tests are conducted to
assess fracture predictions under different pressure levels. Thirdly, a
concrete cylinder is subjected to uniaxial and triaxial compression to
investigate the influence of confinement. Finally, the localised failure of a
soil slope is predicted and the results are compared with other formulations
for the strain energy decomposition proposed in the literature. The results
provide a good qualitative agreement with experimental observations and
demonstrate the capabilities of phase field fracture methods to predict crack
nucleation and growth under multi-axial loading in materials exhibiting
asymmetric tension-compression fracture behaviour.

bulk composition of their parent bodies, but also the result of how and when
internal differentiation took place. Here we focus on this second aspect
considering the two principal parameters involved: size and accretion time of
the body. We discuss the interplay of the various time scales related to
heating, cooling and drainage of silicate liquids. Based on two phase flow
modelling in 1-D spherical geometry, we show that drainage time is proportional
to two independent parameters: $\mu_m/R^2$, the ratio of the matrix viscosity
to the square of the body radius and $\mu_f/a^2$, the ratio of the liquid
viscosity to the square of the matrix grain size. We review the dependence of
these properties on temperature, thermal history and degree of melting,
demonstrating that they vary by several orders of magnitude during thermal
evolution. These variations call into question the results of two phase flow
modelling of small body differentiation that assume constant properties.For
example, the idea that liquid migration was efficient enough to remove
$^{26}$Al heat sources from the interior of bodies and dampen their melting
(e.g. Moskovitz and Gaidos, 2011; Neumann et al., 2012) relies on percolation
rates of silicate liquids overestimated by six to eight orders of magnitude. In
bodies accreted during the first few million years of solar-system history, we
conclude that drainage cannot prevent the occurrence of a global magma ocean.
These conditions seem ideal to explain the generation of the parent-bodies of
iron meteorites. A map of the different evolutionary scenarios of small bodies
as a function of size and accretion time is proposed.

(DL) transition have revealed intriguing features in a wide range of
non-Hermitian systems. The present study aims at exploring the spectral and
dynamical properties in a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic system with asymmetric
hopping in the presence of Rashba Spin-Orbit (RSO) interaction. In particular,
in such systems, we have identified that the DL transition is associated with a
concurrent change in the energy spectrum, where the eigenstates always break
the time-reversal symmetry for all strenghts of the quasiperiodic potential,
contrary to the systems without RSO interaction. Remarkably, we find that the
reality of energy spectrum under the open boundary condition that is frequently
symbolised as a hallmark of the skin-effect, is a system-size dependent
phenomena, and appears even when the associated energies are indeed complex. In
addition, it is demonstrated that the spin-flip term in the RSO interaction in
fact possesses a tendency to diminish the directionality of the skin-effect. On
scrutinizing the dynamical attributes in our non-Hermitian system, we unveil
that in spite of the fact that the spectral DL transition accords with the
dynamical phase transition, interestingly, the system comes across
hyper-diffusive and negative diffusion dynamical regimes depending upon the
strength of the RSO interaction, in the spectrally localized regime.

divide a large EA task into several subtasks such that each subtask only needs

screening and medical intervention. Prevailing computer-aided skin cancer
classification systems employ deep learning approaches. However, recent studies
reveal their extreme vulnerability to adversarial attacks -- often
imperceptible perturbations to significantly reduce the performances of skin
cancer diagnosis models. To mitigate these threats, this work presents a
simple, effective, and resource-efficient defense framework by reverse
engineering adversarial perturbations in skin cancer images. Specifically, a
multiscale image pyramid is first established to better preserve discriminative
structures in the medical imaging domain. To neutralize adversarial effects,
skin images at different scales are then progressively diffused by injecting
isotropic Gaussian noises to move the adversarial examples to the clean image
manifold. Crucially, to further reverse adversarial noises and suppress
redundant injected noises, a novel multiscale denoising mechanism is carefully
designed that aggregates image information from neighboring scales. We
evaluated the defensive effectiveness of our method on ISIC 2019, a largest
skin cancer multiclass classification dataset. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method can successfully reverse adversarial perturbations
from different attacks and significantly outperform some state-of-the-art
methods in defending skin cancer diagnosis models.

tuneability. In stacks of 2D materials, for example, the twist angle can be
employed to tune their properties. However, while material choice and twist

discover a lattice of strongly correlated electrons in a perfectly ordered 2D
supramolecular network by driving this system through a cascade of quantum

that new entities all emerge once in a batch, which oversimplifies the real

aggregation is designed to encode and update entities using their neighboring

the sparse link problem of new entities, we propose a link augmentation

metallicities, whereas the higher mass ones are in accordance with the model
predictions. This might hint at the cut-off of pristine gas inflow and/or the
removal of the hot halo gas as the mechanisms driving these offsets. Our
morpho-kinematic analysis reveals a sub-sample of dwarfs with maximum
velocities vmax <50 km/s, which depart from the Tully-Fisher relation. This
might indicate that their interstellar medium is affected by ram pressure
stripping. However, ~30% of the cluster galaxies have rotation-dominated gas
disks and follow the Tully-Fisher relation. In the stellar mass-S0.5 plane, the
systems follow a tight sequence, with only a sub-population of 5 galaxies
strongly departing from this relation. Both the morphology and kinematics of
the outlier galaxies hint at a combination of pre-processing and
cluster-specific interactions affecting their stellar and gas disks.

  Hypergraph-based Approach","Accepted at the IEEE Information Theory Workshop, 2022",,,,"cs.IT math.CO math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In pliable index coding (PICOD), a number of clients are connected via a
noise-free broadcast channel to a server which has a list of messages. Each
client has a unique subset of messages at the server as side-information and
requests for any one message not in the side-information. A PICOD scheme of
length $\ell$ is a set of $\ell$ encoded transmissions broadcast from the
server such that all clients are satisfied. Finding the optimal (minimum)
length of PICOD and designing PICOD schemes that have small length are the
fundamental questions in PICOD. In this paper, we use a hypergraph-based
approach to derive new achievability and converse results for PICOD. We present
an algorithm which gives an achievable scheme for PICOD with length at most
$\Delta(\mathcal{H})$, where $\Delta(\mathcal{H})$ is the maximum degree of any
vertex in a hypergraph that represents the PICOD problem. We also give a lower
bound for the optimal PICOD length using a new structural parameter associated
with the PICOD hypergraph called the nesting number. We extend some of our
results to the PICOD problem where each client demands $t$ messages, rather
than just one. Finally, we identify a class of problems for which our converse
is tight, and also characterize the optimal PICOD lengths of problems with

levitation schemes, because it allows stable levitation at room temperature
without the need for a continuous power supply. However, dissipation by eddy
currents in conventional diamagnetic materials significantly limits the
application potential of diamagnetically levitating systems. Here, we present a
route towards high $Q$ macroscopic levitating resonators by substantially
reducing eddy current damping using graphite particle based diamagnetic
composites. We demonstrate resonators that feature quality factors $Q$ above
450,000 and vibration lifetimes beyond one hour, while levitating above
permanent magnets in high vacuum at room temperature. The composite resonators
have a $Q$ that is more than 400 times higher than that of diamagnetic graphite
plates. By tuning the composite particle size and density, we investigate the
dissipation reduction mechanism and enhance the $Q$ of the levitating
resonators. Since their estimated acceleration noise is as low as some of the
best superconducting levitating accelerometers at cryogenic temperatures, the
high $Q$ and large mass of the presented composite resonators positions them as
one of the most promising technologies for next generation ultra-sensitive room

broadening ($v\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$), but very small emitting area

from V1331 Cyg (Doppmann et al. 2011) and SVS 13 (Carr et al. 2004) suggests
that the presence of such a reservoir may be linked to evolutionary state,
perhaps related to the presence of high accretion rates or winds. While the
inner disk may harbor such a reservoir, simple Keplerian models do not match
well with emitting line shapes, and alternative velocity fields must be
considered. We also present a new idea, that the unusual emission could arise

South. The epidemiology of Plasmodium vivax, the most geographically expansive
agent of human malaria, is characterised by the accrual of a reservoir of
dormant parasites known as hypnozoites. Relapses, arising from hypnozoite
activation events, comprise the majority of the blood-stage infection burden,
with implications for the acquisition of immunity and the distribution of
superinfection. Here, we construct a hybrid transmission model for P. vivax
that concurrently accounts for the accrual of the hypnozoite reservoir,
(blood-stage) superinfection and the acquisition of immunity. We begin by
analytically characterising within-host dynamics as a function of
mosquito-to-human transmission intensity, extending our previous model
(comprising an open network of infinite server queues) to capture a discretised
immunity level. To model transmission-blocking and antidisease immunity, we
allow for geometric decay in the respective probabilities of successful
human-to-mosquito transmission and symptomatic blood-stage infection as a
function of this immunity level. Under a hybrid approximation -- whereby
probabilistic within-host distributions are cast as expected population-level
proportions -- we couple host and vector dynamics to recover a deterministic
compartmental model in line with Ross-Macdonald theory. We then perform a
steady-state analysis for this compartmental model, informed by the (analytic)
distributions derived at the within-host level. To characterise transient
dynamics, we derive a reduced system of integrodifferential equations (IDEs),
likewise informed by our within-host queueing network, allowing us to recover
population-level distributions for various quantities of epidemiological
interest. Our model provides insights into important, but poorly understood,
epidemiological features of P. vivax.

material with a sufficient refractive index contrast. The optical responses of
these structures, namely the associated photonic bandgap or stopband, are of
particular interest for any application involving light. The sensitivity of the
photonic bandgap to changes in lattice size or refractive index composition
creates the possibility foraccurate optical sensors. Optical phenomena
involving reduced group velocity at wavelengths on the edge of the photonic
bandgap are commonly exploited for photocatalytic applications. The inherent
reflectivity of the photonic bandgap has created applications in optical
waveguides or as solar cell reflector layers. There are countless examples of
research attempting to exploit these facets of photonic crystal behaviorfor
improved material design. Here, the role of photonic crystals is reviewed
across a wide a variety of disciplines; cataloguing the ways in which these
structures have enhanced specific applications. Particular emphasis is placed
on providing an understanding of the specific function of the tunable optical
response in photonic crystals in relation to their application.

(2) our cumulative distribution function (CDF) of stellar distances from O

models in an intra-study cross-validation experiment using TCGA-CRC-DX dataset
(N = 462), but also showed excellent generalizability in cross-study external
validation and delivered a SOTA AUROC of 0.90 for MSI using the MCO dataset for
training (N = 1065) and the same TCGA-CRC-DX for testing. Similar performance
(AUROC=0.91) was achieved by Echle and colleagues using approximately 8000
training samples (ResNet18) on the same testing dataset. Swin-T was extremely
efficient using small training datasets and exhibits robust predictive
performance with only 200-500 training samples. These data indicate that Swin-T

model parameters or gradients can expose private training data samples. To
address this challenge, we adopt secure multiparty computation (SMC) to
establish a privacy-preserving federated learning framework. In our proposed
method, the hospitals are divided into clusters. After local training, each
hospital splits its model weights among other hospitals in the same cluster
such that no single hospital can retrieve other hospitals' weights on its own.
Then, all hospitals sum up the received weights, sending the results to the
central server. Finally, the central server aggregates the results, retrieving
the average of models' weights and updating the model without having access to
individual hospitals' weights. We conduct experiments on a publicly available
repository, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We compare the performance of the
proposed framework with differential privacy and federated averaging as the
baseline. The results reveal that compared to differential privacy, our
framework can achieve higher accuracy with no privacy leakage risk at a cost of
higher communication overhead.

decades in the computer vision and computer graphics community. We propose
Vox-Surf, a voxel-based implicit surface representation. Our Vox-Surf divides
the space into finite bounded voxels. Each voxel stores geometry and appearance
information in its corner vertices. Vox-Surf is suitable for almost any
scenario thanks to sparsity inherited from voxel representation and can be
easily trained from multiple view images. We leverage the progressive training
procedure to extract important voxels gradually for further optimization so
that only valid voxels are preserved, which greatly reduces the number of
sampling points and increases rendering speed.The fine voxels can also be
considered as the bounding volume for collision detection.The experiments show
that Vox-Surf representation can learn delicate surface details and accurate
color with less memory and faster rendering speed than other methods.We also
show that Vox-Surf can be more practical in scene editing and AR applications.

the crucial role RCs play in determining the progress of a chemical reaction.
The choice of the reaction coordinate is often based on heuristic knowledge.
However, an essential criterion for the choice is that the coordinate should
capture both the reactant and product states unequivocally. Also, the
coordinate should be the slowest one so that all the other degrees of freedom
can easily equilibrate along the reaction coordinate. Also, the coordinate
should be the slowest one so that all the other degrees of freedom can easily
equilibrate along the reaction coordinate. We used a regularised sparse
autoencoder, an energy-based model, to discover a crucial set of reaction
coordinates. Along with discovering reaction coordinates, our model also
predicts the evolution of a molecular dynamics(MD) trajectory. We showcased
that including sparsity enforcing regularisation helps in choosing a small but
important set of reaction coordinates. We used two model systems to demonstrate
our approach: alanine dipeptide system and proflavine and DNA system, which
exhibited intercalation of proflavine into DNA minor groove in an aqueous
environment. We model MD trajectory as a multivariate time series, and our
latent variable model performs the task of multi-step time series prediction.
This idea is inspired by the popular sparse coding approach - to represent each
input sample as a linear combination of few elements taken from a set of
representative patterns.

claim is made that quantum theory can be interpreted in an intelligible way by
positing a bundle-theoretic view of objective idealism instead of materialism

high cost of obtaining high-quality point clouds. Therefore, with the recent
remarkable development of deep learning, point cloud up-sampling research,
which uses deep learning to generate high-quality point clouds from low-quality
point clouds, is one of the fields attracting considerable attention. This
paper proposes a new point cloud up-sampling method called Point cloud
Up-sampling via Multi-scale Features Attention (PU-MFA). Inspired by previous
studies that reported good performance using the multi-scale features or
attention mechanisms, PU-MFA merges the two through a U-Net structure. In
addition, PU-MFA adaptively uses multi-scale features to refine the global
features effectively. The performance of PU-MFA was compared with other
state-of-the-art methods through various experiments using the PU-GAN dataset,

real-scanned point cloud dataset. In various experimental results, PU-MFA
showed superior performance in quantitative and qualitative evaluation compared

interactions and long-lasting relationships in different fields, from
educational, service, collaborative, companion, care-home and medical robotics.
In particular, we aimed in investigating how robots can manipulate (i.e.
creating, improving, and recovering) people's ability of accepting and trusting
them for a fruitful and successful coexistence between humans and people. While
advanced progresses are reached in studying and evaluating the factors
affecting acceptance and trust of people in robots in controlled or short-term

are accepted and trusted by people where the supervision of operators is not
possible, still presents an open challenge for scientists in robotics, AI and
HRI fields. In such unstructured static and dynamic human-centred environments
scenarios, robots should be able to learn and adapt their behaviours to the
situational context, but also to people's prior experiences and learned
associations, their expectations, and their and the robot's ability to predict
and understand each other's behaviours. Although the previous editions valued
the participation of leading researchers in the field and several exceptional
invited speakers who tackled down some fundamental points in this research

  Synthesizing Network",,,,,"cs.CR cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving
distributed machine learning framework recently. It aims at collaboratively
learning a shared global model by performing distributed training locally on
edge devices and aggregating local models into a global one without centralized
raw data sharing in the cloud server. However, due to the large local data
heterogeneities (Non-I.I.D. data) across edge devices, the FL may easily obtain
a global model that can produce more shifted gradients on local datasets,
thereby degrading the model performance or even suffering from the
non-convergence during training. In this paper, we propose a novel FL training
framework, dubbed Fed-FSNet, using a properly designed Fuzzy Synthesizing
Network (FSNet) to mitigate the Non-I.I.D. FL at-the-source. Concretely, we
maintain an edge-agnostic hidden model in the cloud server to estimate a
less-accurate while direction-aware inversion of the global model. The hidden
model can then fuzzily synthesize several mimic I.I.D. data samples (sample
features) conditioned on only the global model, which can be shared by edge
devices to facilitate the FL training towards faster and better convergence.
Moreover, since the synthesizing process involves neither access to the
parameters/updates of local models nor analyzing individual local model
outputs, our framework can still ensure the privacy of FL. Experimental results
on several FL benchmarks demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate
the Non-I.I.D. issue and obtain better performance against other representative
methods.

computer vision plays an essential role. However, most public drone-based
vision datasets focus on detection and tracking. On the other hand, the
performance of most existing image super-resolution methods is sensitive to the
dataset, specifically, the degradation model between high-resolution and
low-resolution images. In this thesis, we propose the first image
super-resolution dataset for drone vision. Image pairs are captured by two
cameras on the drone with different focal lengths. We collect data at different
altitudes and then propose pre-processing steps to align image pairs. Extensive
empirical studies show domain gaps exist among images captured at different
altitudes. Meanwhile, the performance of pretrained image super-resolution
networks also suffers a drop on our dataset and varies among altitudes.
Finally, we propose two methods to build a robust image super-resolution
network at different altitudes. The first feeds altitude information into the
network through altitude-aware layers. The second uses one-shot learning to
quickly adapt the super-resolution model to unknown altitudes. Our results
reveal that the proposed methods can efficiently improve the performance of

its size with another 2121 refined video segments with both unimodal and

rich acoustic and visual emotion-bearing context to highlight non-verbal cues
for sentiment prediction. Secondly, from the model perspective, benefiting from
the unimodal annotations and the unsupervised data in the CH-SIMS v2.0, the
Acoustic Visual Mixup Consistent (AV-MC) framework is proposed. The designed
modality mixup module can be regarded as an augmentation, which mixes the

unobserved multimodal context along with the text, the model can learn to be

$\textrm{CO}_2$. Our model is based solely on standard structural input files
containing atomistic descriptions of the adsorbent material candidates. We
construct novel methodological extensions to match the prediction accuracy of
classical machine learning models that were built with hundreds of features at
much higher computational cost. Our approach can be more broadly applied to
optimize gas capture processes at industrial scale.

multifunctional performance of graphene and related materials are of great
scientific and technological interest. New opportunities are provided by the
fabrication of a novel class of nanocomposites with a nanolaminate
architecture. In this work, by using the iterative lift-off/float-on process
combined with wet depositions, we incorporated cm-size graphene monolayers
produced via Chemical Vapour Deposition into a poly (methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) matrix with a controlled, alternate-layered structure. The produced
nanolaminate shows a significant improvement in mechanical properties, with
enhanced stiffness, strength and toughness, with the addition of only 0.06 vol%
of graphene. Furthermore, oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability measurements
performed at different relative humidity levels, reveal that the addition of
graphene leads to significant reduction of permeability, compared to neat PMMA.
Overall, we demonstrate that the produced graphene-PMMA nanolaminate surpasses,
in terms of gas barrier properties, the traditional discontinuous
graphene-particle composites with a similar filler content. Moreover, we found
that the gas permeability through the nanocomposites departs from a monotonic
decrease as a function of relative humidity, which is instead evident in the
case of the pure PMMA nanolaminate. This work suggests the possible use of
Chemical Vapour Deposition graphene-polymer nanolaminates as a flexible gas
barrier, thus enlarging the spectrum of applications for this novel material.

  Machine Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Predicting mechanical properties in metal additive manufacturing (MAM) is
vital to ensure the printed parts' performance, reliability, and whether they
can fulfill requirements for a specific application. Conducting experiments to
estimate mechanical properties in MAM processes, however, is a laborious and
expensive task. Also, they can solely be designed for a particular material in
a certain MAM process. Nonetheless, Machine learning (ML) methods, which are
more flexible and cost-effective solutions, can be utilized to predict
mechanical properties based on the processing parameters and material
properties. To this end, in this work, a comprehensive framework for
benchmarking ML for mechanical properties is introduced. An extensive
experimental dataset is collected from more than 90 MAM articles and 140 MAM
companies' data sheets containing MAM processing conditions, machines,
materials, and resultant mechanical properties, including yield strength,
ultimate tensile strength, elastic modulus, elongation, hardness as well as
surface roughness. Physics-aware MAM featurization, adjustable ML models, and
evaluation metrics are proposed to construct a comprehensive learning framework
for mechanical properties prediction. Additionally, the Explainable AI method,
i.e., SHAP analysis was studied to explain and interpret the ML models'
predicted values for mechanical properties. Moreover, data-driven explicit
models have been identified to estimate mechanical properties based on the
processing parameters and material properties with more interpretability as
compared to the employed ML models.

changing slowly towards scenarios in which occupants have more choice and
flexibility in where and how they work. The global COVID-19 pandemic
accelerated this phenomenon rapidly through lockdowns and hybrid work
arrangements. Many occupants and employers are considering keeping some of
these flexibility-based strategies due to their benefits and cost impacts. This
paper simulates various scenarios related to the operational technologies and
policies of a real-world campus using a district-scale City Energy Analyst
(CEA) model that is calibrated with measured energy and occupancy profiles
extracted from WiFi data. These scenarios demonstrate the energy impact of
ramping building operations up and down more rapidly and effectively to the
flex-based work strategies that may solidify. The scenarios show a 4-12%
decrease in space cooling demand due to occupant absenteeism if centralized
building system operation is in place, but as high as 21-68% if
occupancy-driven building controls are implemented. The paper discusses
technologies and strategies that are important in this paradigm shift of
operations.
