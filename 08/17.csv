algorithms on near-term small and noisy devices. In particular, we generalise
earlier ""learning to measure"" strategies in two ways. First, by considering a
class of adaptive positive operator valued measures (POVMs) that can be
simulated with simple projective measurements without ancillary qubits, we
decrease the amount of required qubits and two-qubit gates. Second, by
introducing a method based on Quantum Detector Tomography to mitigate the
effect of noise, we are able to optimise the POVMs as well as to infer
expectation values reliably in the currently available noisy quantum devices.
Our numerical simulations clearly indicate that the presented strategies can
significantly reduce the number of needed shots to achieve chemical accuracy in
variational quantum eigensolvers, thus helping to solve one of the bottlenecks
of near-term quantum computing.

  Tutorial",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Auto-encoding Variational Bayes (AEVB) is a powerful and general algorithm
for fitting latent variable models (a promising direction for unsupervised
learning), and is well-known for training the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE).
In this tutorial, we focus on motivating AEVB from the classic Expectation
Maximization (EM) algorithm, as opposed to from deterministic auto-encoders.
Though natural and somewhat self-evident, the connection between EM and AEVB is
not emphasized in the recent deep learning literature, and we believe that
emphasizing this connection can improve the community's understanding of AEVB.
In particular, we find it especially helpful to view (1) optimizing the
evidence lower bound (ELBO) with respect to inference parameters as approximate
E-step and (2) optimizing ELBO with respect to generative parameters as
approximate M-step; doing both simultaneously as in AEVB is then simply
tightening and pushing up ELBO at the same time. We discuss how approximate
E-step can be interpreted as performing variational inference. Important
concepts such as amortization and the reparametrization trick are discussed in
great detail. Finally, we derive from scratch the AEVB training procedures of a
non-deep and several deep latent variable models, including VAE, Conditional
VAE, Gaussian Mixture VAE and Variational RNN. It is our hope that readers
would recognize AEVB as a general algorithm that can be used to fit a wide
range of latent variable models (not just VAE), and apply AEVB to such models
that arise in their own fields of research. PyTorch code for all included
models are publicly available.

control these processes for bottom-up manufacturing and understand their

systematically study the effect of surfactant nature and concentration on the

magnitude of concentration. The minimum effective concentration is found
approximately equal to the critical micelle concentration (CMC), or the

understanding of the impact of long-range and local structural features on

methods to control polymorphism and cation disorder in Na-Y-Zr-Cl solid

the existence of a more conductive P2$_1$/n polymorph of Na$_2$ZrCl$_6$ formed
upon ball milling. In Na$_3$YCl$_6$, the R$\bar{3}$ polymorph is shown to be
more conductive than its P2$_1$/n counterpart owing to the presence of
intrinsic vacancies and disorder on the Y sublattice. Transition metal ordering
in the Na$_{2.25}$Y$_{0.25}$Zr$_{0.75}$Cl$_6$ composition strongly impacts
Na-ion transport, where a greater mixing of Y$^{3+}$ and Zr$^{4+}$ on the
transition metal sublattice facilitates ion migration through partial
activation of Cl rotations at relevant temperatures. Overall, Na-ion transport
sensitively depends on the phases and transition metal distributions stabilized

monitoring targets or areas of interest. Maintaining the network for continuous
surveillance is a challenge due to the limited battery capacity in each sensor.
Wireless power transfer technology is emerging as a reliable solution for
energizing the sensors by deploying a mobile charger (MC) to recharge the
sensor. However, designing an optimal charging path for the MC is challenging
because of uncertainties arising in the networks. The energy consumption rate
of the sensors may fluctuate significantly due to unpredictable changes in the
network topology, such as node failures. These changes also lead to shifts in
the importance of each sensor, which are often assumed to be the same in
existing works. We address these challenges in this paper by proposing a novel
adaptive charging scheme using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach.
Specifically, we endow the MC with a charging policy that determines the next
sensor to charge conditioning on the current state of the network. We then use
a deep neural network to parametrize this charging policy, which will be
trained by reinforcement learning techniques. Our model can adapt to
spontaneous changes in the network topology. The empirical results show that
the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing on-demand algorithms by a

matrix into the sum of two components. Through a latent factor representation,
they can be interpreted as a diagonal matrix of idiosyncratic variances and a
shared variation matrix, that is, the product of a p x k factor loadings matrix
and its transpose. If k << p, this defines a sparse factorization of the
covariance matrix. Historically, little attention has been paid to
incorporating prior information in Bayesian analyses using factor models where,
at best, the prior for the factor loadings is order invariant. In this work, a
class of structured priors is developed that can encode ideas of dependence
structure about the shared variation matrix. The construction allows
data-informed shrinkage towards sensible parametric structures while also
facilitating inference over the number of factors. Using an unconstrained
reparameterization of stationary vector autoregressions, the methodology is
extended to stationary dynamic factor models. For computational inference,

even contains misleading information (e.g. buggy firmware). In this work, we
propose a new approach that builds peripheral models from the peripheral
specification. Using NLP, we translate peripheral behaviors in human language

By checking, executing, and chaining them at runtime, we can dynamically
synthesize a peripheral model for each firmware execution. The extracted
condition-action rules might not be complete or even be wrong. We, therefore,
propose incorporating symbolic execution to quickly pinpoint the root cause.
This assists us in the manual correction of the problematic rules. We have

limits their usage and development by the wider community. We present a
python-based one-dimensional atmospheric radiative-convective equilibrium
model. This model has heritage from the Fortran-based code (Marley et al.,1996}
which has been widely used to model the atmospheres of Solar System objects,
brown dwarfs, and exoplanets. In short, the basic capability of the original
model is to compute the atmospheric state of the object under
radiative-convective equilibrium given its effective or internal temperature,
gravity, and host--star properties (if relevant). In the new model, which has
been included within the well-utilized code-base PICASO, we have added these
original features as well as the new capability of self-consistently treating

this challenge by exploiting the stochastic switching activity of STT-RAM cells

our technique by analyzing the vulnerability of write operation against
radiation-induced soft errors and applying a low-cost improvement. Due to
serious reliability challenges in nanometer-scale technology, the robustness of

superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. After defining the response as a
two-point two-fermion correlation function in the basis of the Bogolyubov's
quasiparticles, the equation of motion (EOM) method is applied using the most
general fermionic Hamiltonian with a bare two-body interaction, also
transformed to the quasiparticle space. As a superfluid extension of the case
of the normal phase, the resulting EOM is of the Bethe-Salpeter-Dyson form with
the static and dynamical interaction kernels, where the former determines the
short-range correlations and the latter is responsible for the long-range ones.
Both kernels as well as the entire EOM have the double dimension as compared to
that of the normal phase. Non-perturbative approximations via the cluster
decomposition of the dynamical kernel are discussed, with the major focus on a
continuous derivation of the quasiparticle-phonon coupling variant of the
latter kernel, where the phonons (vibrations) are composite correlated
two-quasiparticle states unifying both the normal and pairing modes. The
developed theory is adopted for nuclear structure applications, such as the
nuclear response in various channels. In particular, the finite-amplitude
method generalized beyond the quasiparticle random phase approximation, taking
into account the quasiparticle-vibration coupling, is formulated for
prospective calculations in non-spherical nuclei.

observed. It is driven by the Marangoni effect. At the transition to Stage II,
the radial flow partially reverses, starting from the contact line. This flow
breaks the axial symmetry and remarkably is driven by the segregation itself.
Finally at Stage III, the flow decays as the evaporation gradually ceases. At
this stage the segregation has grown to the entire droplet, and the flow is
again controlled by the Marangoni effect. The resulting Marangoni flow
homogenizes the distribution of the entrapped volatile water over the whole
droplet.

  Repo: https://github.com/arthur-qiu/StyleFaceV",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Realistic generative face video synthesis has long been a pursuit in both
computer vision and graphics community. However, existing face video generation
methods tend to produce low-quality frames with drifted facial identities and
unnatural movements. To tackle these challenges, we propose a principled
framework named StyleFaceV, which produces high-fidelity identity-preserving
face videos with vivid movements. Our core insight is to decompose appearance
and pose information and recompose them in the latent space of StyleGAN3 to
produce stable and dynamic results. Specifically, StyleGAN3 provides strong
priors for high-fidelity facial image generation, but the latent space is
intrinsically entangled. By carefully examining its latent properties, we
propose our decomposition and recomposition designs which allow for the
disentangled combination of facial appearance and movements. Moreover, a
temporal-dependent model is built upon the decomposed latent features, and
samples reasonable sequences of motions that are capable of generating
realistic and temporally coherent face videos. Particularly, our pipeline is
trained with a joint training strategy on both static images and high-quality
video data, which is of higher data efficiency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art face video generation
results both qualitatively and quantitatively. Notably, StyleFaceV is capable
of generating realistic $1024\times1024$ face videos even without
high-resolution training videos.

a hot super-virial phase at log ($T/$K) = $6.88_{-0.07}^{+0.08}$ is required.
Furthermore, we present observations of five fields within $5$ degrees of the
primary field. Their spectra also require a two-phase model at warm-hot and hot
temperatures. The hot phase, first discovered in Das et al. 2019, appears to be
widespread. By chemical tagging we show that emission from the supevirial phase
comes from the L-shell transitions of Fe XVIII-FeXXII, and that the range of
temperatures probed in emission is distinct from that in absorption. We detect
scatter in temperature and emission measure (EM) in both the phases, and deduce
that there is small-scale density inhomogeneity in the MW CGM. The emitting gas
likely has higher density, possibly from regions close to the disk of the MW,
while the absorption in the virial phase may arise from low-density gas
extended out to the virial radius of the MW. The presence of the super-virial
phase far from the regions around the Galactic center implicates physical
processes unrelated to the activity at the Galactic center. Hot outflows
resulting from star-formation activity throughout the Galactic disk are likely
responsible for producing this phase.

successive perihelia (at 1.76 AU), indicative of a sublimation origin. The
absence of 4.6 um band excess indicates zero or negligible CO or CO2 gas
production from P3. The properties of the ejected dust are remarkably
consistent with those found in other main-belt comets (continuous emission of
~0.05-5 mm particles at 0.3-3 m/s speeds), with mass-loss rates of >~2 kg/s.
The orbit of P3 is unstable on timescales ~10 Myr. We speculate that P3 has
recently arrived from a more stable source (either the Kuiper Belt or elsewhere
in the main belt) and has been physically aged at its current location, finally
becoming indistinguishable from a weakly sublimating asteroid in terms of its
dust properties. Whatever the source of P3, given the dynamical instability of
its current orbit, P3 should not be used to trace the native distribution of
asteroid ice.

extension of the Standard Model (SM) to account for tiny neutrino masses.
Recently, the seesaw effective field theories (SEFTs) of the three canonical

$N^{}_{\rm R}$ and $\Phi$, and finally achieve the complete one-loop structure
of the type-(I+II) SEFT. In the type-(I+II) SEFT, the number and content of
dim-6 operators are exactly the same as those in the type-II SEFT, but the
Wilson coefficients of the unique dim-5 and nine dim-6 operators as well as the
quartic coupling constant of the SM Higgs gain some additional contributions,

potential for the radial direction of the Peccei-Quinn field, naturally
realized in supersymmetric models. We carefully compute the efficiency of this

the sum of the squares of the neutrino masses and so can strengthen as the

evolution of IMBHs throughout their dynamical lifetimes, ending with their
ejection from the parent cluster due to gravitational radiation recoil from BH
mergers, or dynamical recoil kicks from few-body scattering encounters. We find
that $ \textit{all}$ of the IMBHs in our models are ejected from the host
cluster within the first $\sim 500$ Myr, indicating a low retention probability
of IMBHs in this mass range for globular clusters today. We estimate the peak
IMBH merger rate to be $\mathcal{R} \approx 2 \, \rm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\rm{yr}^{-1}$

leads to a density of $\rho_{p} = 9.4^{+1.6}_{-1.5}$ $\rm g~cm^{-3}$, a
significantly lower value than previously reported in the literature. We use
planet interior models that assume a two-layer planet comprised of a liquid,
pure Fe core and iron-free, $\rm MgSiO_{3}$ mantle, and we determine the range
of core mass fractions that are consistent with the observed mass and radius.
We use existing high-resolution spectra of the host star to derive Fe/Mg/Si
abundances ([Fe/H]$=-0.03 \pm 0.01$, [Mg/H]$= 0.04 \pm 0.02$, [Si/H]$=0.03 \pm

reflects the relative refractory abundances of its host star. K2-106b is
therefore unlikely to be a super-Mercury, as has been suggested in previous

crucial step in determining what resolution and what conditions are required to
properly capture the magnetic fields observed in galaxies. Here, we present an
extensive study on the numerical dependencies of the galactic dynamo in
isolated spiral galaxies using smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD).
We performed 53 isolated spiral galaxy simulations with different initial
setups, feedback, resolution, Jeans floor and dissipation parameters. The
results show a strong mean-field dynamo occurring in the spiral-arm region of
the disk, likely produced by the classical alpha-omega dynamo or the recently
described gravitational instability dynamo. The inclusion of feedback is seen
to work in both a destructive and positive fashion for the amplification
process. Destructive interference for the amplification occurs due to break
down of filament structure in the disk, increase of turbulent diffusion and the
ejection of magnetic flux from the central plane to the circumgalactic medium.
The positive effect of feedback is the increase in vertical motions and the
turbulent fountain flows that develop, showing a high dependence on the
small-scale vertical structure and the numerical dissipation within the galaxy.
Galaxies with an effective dynamo saturate their magnetic energy density at
levels between 10-30% of the thermal energy density. The density averaged
numerical Prandtl number is found to be below unity throughout the galaxy for
all our simulations, with an increasing value with radius. Assuming a turbulent
injection length of 1 kpc, the numerical magnetic Reynolds number are within
the range of $Re_{mag}=10-400$, indicating that some regions are below the
levels required for the small-scale dynamo ($Re_{mag,crit}=30-2700$) to be
active.

limitation is seen to recover the Taub inequality in the case of a zero heat
flux, but is more strict if a non-zero heat flux is considered. These results
imply that, in order for the distribution function to be non-negative, (i) the
energy of a gas must be larger than a minimum threshold; (ii) the heat flux, on
the other hand, has a maximum value determined by the energy and the pressure
tensor; and (iii) there exists an upper limit for the the adiabatic index
$\Gamma$ of the relativistic equation of state, and that limit decreases in the

Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The estimated $B_{\rm pos}$ is $\sim$80 to
1200 $\mu$G. From Wang et al., $B_{\rm pos}$ of E-47, a core in the eastern hub
(E-hub), and E-hub were re-estimated to be 500 and 320 $\mu$G, respectively,
with the same method. We measured the gravitational ($E_{\rm G}$), kinematic
($E_{\rm K}$), and magnetic energies ($E_{\rm B}$) in the filament and hubs and
compared the relative importance among them. We found that an $E_{\rm
B}$-dominant filament has $aligned$ fragmentation type, while $E_{\rm
G}$-dominant hubs show $no$ and $clustered$ fragmentation types. In the $E_{\rm
G}$ dominant hubs, it seems that the portion of $E_{\rm K}$ determines whether
the hub becomes to have $clustered$ (the portion of $E_{\rm K}\sim20\%$) or
$no$ fragmentation type ($\sim10\%$). We propose an evolutionary scenario for
the E- and W-HFSs, where the HFS forms first by the collision of turbulent
flows, and then the hubs and filaments can go into various types of
fragmentation depending on their energy balance of gravity, turbulence, and
magnetic field.

solution to address the limited communication resource problem of single-server
FL. We consider a typical multi-server FL architecture, where the coverage
areas of regional servers may overlap. The key point of this architecture is
that the clients located in the overlapping areas update their local models
based on the average model of all accessible regional models, which enables
indirect model sharing among different regional servers. Due to the complicated
network topology, the convergence analysis is much more challenging than
single-server FL. In this paper, we firstly propose a novel MS-FedAvg algorithm
for this multi-server FL architecture and analyze its convergence on non-iid
datasets for general non-convex settings. Since the number of clients located
in each regional server is much less than in single-server FL, the bandwidth of
each client should be large enough to successfully communicate training models
with the server, which indicates that full client participation can work in
multi-server FL. Also, we provide the convergence analysis of the partial
client participation scheme and develop a new biased partial participation
strategy to further accelerate convergence. Our results indicate that the
convergence results highly depend on the ratio of the number of clients in each
area type to the total number of clients in all three strategies. The extensive
experiments show remarkable performance and support our theoretical results.

largely unexplored for long-chain organic molecules. Here, we report
light-driven C-H activation in complex organic materials mediated by 2D
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and the resultant solid-state
synthesis of luminescent carbon dots in a spatially resolved fashion. Through
the first-principle calculations, we unravel that the defects and oxidized

Furthermore, we exploit the light-controlled point-and-shoot chemical reaction
for versatile carbon dot patterning and optical encoding of encrypted

computational infrastructure at hand. This assignment is complicated by the
facts that (a) tasks typically have highly heterogeneous resource requirements
and (b) in many infrastructures, compute nodes offer highly heterogeneous
resources. In consequence, predictions of the runtime of a given task on a
given node, as required by many scheduling algorithms, are often rather
imprecise, which can lead to sub-optimal scheduling decisions.
  We propose Reshi, a method for recommending task-node assignments during
workflow execution that can cope with heterogeneous tasks and heterogeneous

are modeled as feature vectors over the results of dedicated micro benchmarks

used as input to a scheduler. For our evaluation, we benchmarked 27 AWS machine

normal logic program-as an (explainable) trained model. Explainability provided
by FOLD-SE is scalable, meaning that regardless of the size of the dataset, the
number of learned rules and learned literals stay quite small while good
accuracy in classification is maintained. A model with smaller number of rules
and literals is easier to understand for human beings. FOLD-SE is competitive
with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost and
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) wrt accuracy of prediction. However, unlike
XGBoost and MLP, the FOLD-SE algorithm is explainable. The FOLD-SE algorithm
builds upon our earlier work on developing the explainable FOLD-R++ machine
learning algorithm for binary classification and inherits all of its positive
features. Thus, pre-processing of the dataset, using techniques such as one-hot
encoding, is not needed. Like FOLD-R++, FOLD-SE uses prefix sum to speed up
computations resulting in FOLD-SE being an order of magnitude faster than
XGBoost and MLP in execution speed. The FOLD-SE algorithm outperforms FOLD-R++
as well as other rule-learning algorithms such as RIPPER in efficiency,
performance and scalability, especially for large datasets. A major reason for
scalable explainability of FOLD-SE is the use of a literal selection heuristics
based on Gini Impurity, as opposed to Information Gain used in FOLD-R++. A

typically change dynamically in real-life scenarios. Furthermore, storing a

scalable to continuous robotic tasks. The proposed approach, Preference-Driven
MORL (PD-MORL), utilizes the preferences as guidance to update the network

ground-based instruments can be improved by using all the archival data to
optimize the subtraction of stellar contributions. We characterize the
performance of RDI on SPHERE/IRDIS data in direct imaging of exoplanets and
disks. We made use of all the archival data in H23 obtained by SPHERE/IRDIS in
the past five years to build a master reference library and perform RDI. In the
point-source detection, RDI can outperform ADI at small angular separations
(<0.4"") if the observing conditions are around the median conditions of our
master reference library. On average, RDI has a gain of ~0.8 mag over ADI at
0.15"" separation for observations under median conditions. We demonstrate that
including more reference targets in the master reference library can indeed
help to improve the performance of RDI. In disk imaging, RDI can reveal more
disk features and provide a more robust recovery of the disk morphology. We
resolve 33 disks in total intensity (19 planet-forming disks and 14 debris
disks), and 4 of them can only be detected with RDI. Two disks are resolved in
scattered light for the first time. Three disks are detected in total intensity
for the first time. The master reference library we built in this work can be
easily implemented into legacy or future SPHERE surveys to perform RDI,
achieving better performance than that of ADI. To obtain optimal RDI gains over
ADI, we recommend future observations be carried out under seeing conditions of

most fundamental challenges facing our society and global ecological systems.
Waste generation is rapidly increasing, with corresponding shifts in the
structure of our societies where almost all nations are moving from rural
agrarian societies to urban and technological ones. However, the connections
between these radical societal shifts and waste generation have not yet been
described. Here we apply scaling theory to establish a new understanding of
waste in urban systems. We identify universal scaling laws of waste generation
across diverse urban systems worldwide for three forms of waste: wastewater,
municipal solid waste, and greenhouse gasses. We show that wastewater
generation scales superlinearly, municipal solid waste scales linearly, and
greenhouse gasses scales sublinearly with city size. In specific cases
production can be understood in terms of city size coupled with financial and
natural resources. For example, wastewater generation can be understood in
terms of the increased economic activity of larger cities, and the deviations
around the scaling relationship - indicating relative efficiency - depend on
GDP per person and local rainfall. We also show how the temporal evolution of
these scaling relationships reveals a loss of economies of scale and the
general increase in waste production, where sublinear scaling relationships
become linear. Our findings suggest general mechanisms controlling waste
generation across diverse cities and global urban systems. Our approach offers
a systematic approach to uncover these underlying mechanisms that might be key
to reducing waste and pursing a more sustainable future.

resources across competing transactions. Most existing fee market designs
utilize a joint, fungible unit of account (e.g., gas in Ethereum) to price
otherwise non-fungible resources such as bandwidth, computation, and storage,
by hardcoding their relative prices. Fixing the relative price of each resource
in this way inhibits granular price discovery, limiting scalability and opening
up the possibility of denial-of-service attacks. As a result, many prominent
networks such as Ethereum and Solana have proposed multi-dimensional fee
markets. In this paper, we provide a principled way to design fee markets that
efficiently price multiple non-fungible resources. Starting from a loss
function specified by the network designer, we show how to compute dynamic
prices that align the network's incentives (to minimize the loss) with those of
the users and miners (to maximize their welfare), even as demand for these
resources changes. Our pricing mechanism follows from a natural decomposition
of the network designer's problem into two parts that are related to each other
via the resource prices. These results can be used to efficiently set fees in
order to improve network performance.

consider both cases of lateral and axial intrusion in which the long axis of

different regimes of behavior for the drag force as a function of the
penetration depth. In lateral intrusion, where the motion is effectively
quasi-two-dimensional, we establish quantitative comparisons with existing

we observe peculiar undulations in the force-depth profiles in a wide range of

non-linear and non-integrable field theories in $(3+1)$-dimensions, living at
finite density and possessing non-trivial topological charges and non-Abelian
internal symmetries (both local and global). With suitable types of ans\""atze,
one can construct infinite-dimensional families of analytic solutions with
non-vanishing topological charges (representing the Baryonic number) labelled
by both two integers numbers and by free scalar fields in $(1+1)$-dimensions.
These exact configurations represent $(3+1)$-dimensional topological solitons
hosting $(1+1)$-dimensional chiral modes localized at the energy density peaks.
First, we analyze the Yang-Mills-Higgs model, in which the fields depend on all
the space-time coordinates (to keep alive the topological Chern-Simons charge),
but in such a way to reduce the equations system to the field equations of
two-dimensional free massless chiral scalar fields. Then, we move to the
non-linear sigma model, showing that a suitable ansatz reduces the field
equations to the one of a two-dimensional free massless scalar field. Then, we
discuss the Skyrme model concluding that the inclusion of the Skyrme term gives
rise to a chiral two-dimensional free massless scalar field (instead of a free
massless field in two dimensions as in the non-linear sigma model) describing
analytically spatially modulated Hadronic layers and tubes. The comparison of
the present approach both with the instantons-dyons liquid approach and with
Lattice QCD is shortly outlined.

regions of open magnetic field on the Sun called coronal holes. The energy
source responsible for accelerating the plasma to high speeds is widely
debated, however there is evidence that it is ultimately magnetic in nature
with candidate mechanisms including wave heating^(1,2) and interchange
reconnection^(3,4,5). The coronal magnetic field near the solar surface is
structured on scales associated with supergranulation convection cells, where
descending flows create intense fields. The energy density in these network
magnetic field bundles is a likely candidate as an energy source of the wind.
Here we report measurements of fast solar wind streams from the Parker Solar
Probe (PSP) spacecraft^6 which provides strong evidence for the interchange
reconnection mechanism. We show that supergranulation structure at the coronal
hole base remains imprinted in the near-Sun solar wind resulting in asymmetric
patches of magnetic 'switchbacks'^(7,8) and bursty wind streams with power
law-like energetic ion spectra to beyond 100 keV. Computer simulations of
interchange reconnection support key features of the observations, including
the ion spectra. Important characteristics of interchange reconnection in the
low corona are inferred from the data including that the reconnection is
collisionless and that the energy release rate is sufficient to power the fast
wind. In this scenario, open magnetic flux undergoes continuous reconnection
and the wind is driven both by the resulting plasma pressure and the radial
Alfvenic flow bursts.

claims for a software-based safety-critical system, particularly when evidence
suggests the software's executions are not statistically independent. We
formalise informal notions of ""doubting"" that the software's executions are

study the extent to which an assumption of independent executions can undermine
conservatism in assessments, and identify conditions under which this impact
is, or is not, significant. These techniques - novel extensions of conservative
Bayesian inference (CBI) methods - are illustrated in two applications: the
assessment of a nuclear power-plant safety protection system and the assessment
of autonomous vehicle (AV) safety. Our analyses reveals: 1) the required amount
of confidence an assessor should possess before subjecting a system to
operational testing. Otherwise, such testing is shown to be futile - no amount
of favourable operational testing evidence will increase one's confidence in
the system being sufficiently dependable; 2) the independence assumption
supports optimistic claims in certain situations, and conservative claims in
other situations; 3) in some scenarios, upon observing a system operate without
failure, an assessor's confidence in the system being sufficiently dependable
is less than it would be had the system exhibited some failures; 4) posterior
confidence in a system being sufficiently dependable is very sensitive to
failures - each additional failure means significantly more operational testing
evidence is required, in order to support a dependability claim.

flavor violation (CLFV) by four orders of magnitude. By considering P and CP
selection rules and the structure of possible charge and current densities, we
show that rates are governed by six nuclear responses. To generate a
microscopic formulation of these responses, we construct in non-relativistic
effective theory (NRET) the CLFV nucleon-level interaction, then embed it in a
nucleus. We discuss previous work, noting the lack of a systematic treatment of
the various small parameters.
  Because the momentum transfer is comparable to the inverse nuclear size, a
full multipole expansion of the response functions is necessary, a daunting
task with Coulomb-distorted electron partial waves. We perform such an
expansion to high precision by introducing a simplifying local electron
momentum, treating the full set of 16 NRET operators. Previous work has been
limited to the simplest charge/spin operators, ignored Coulomb distortion (or
alternatively truncated the partial wave expansion) and the nucleon velocity
operator, which is responsible for three of the response functions. This
generates inconsistencies in the treatment of small parameters. We obtain a
""master formula"" for mu-to-e conversion that properly treats all such effects
and those of the muon velocity. We compute muon-to-electron conversion rates
for a series of experimental targets, deriving bounds on the coefficients of
the CLFV operators.
  We discuss the nuclear physics: two types of coherence enhance certain CLFV
operators and selection rules blind elastic mu-to-e conversion to others. We
discuss the matching of the NRET onto higher level EFTs, and the relation to
mu-to-e conversion to other CLFV tests. Finally we describe a publicly
available script that can be used to compute mu-to-e conversion rates in
nuclear targets.

practice, this paper focuses on the generalization of neural networks whose
training dynamics do not necessarily converge to fixed points. Our main
contribution is to propose a notion of statistical algorithmic stability (SAS)

to study its connection to generalization. This ergodic-theoretic approach
leads to new insights when compared to the traditional optimization and
learning theory perspectives. We prove that the stability of the
time-asymptotic behavior of a learning algorithm relates to its generalization
and empirically demonstrate how loss dynamics can provide clues to
generalization performance. Our findings provide evidence that networks that

causing line broadening and decreasing the coherence time (T2). Following our
previous electric and magnetic field noise work, we investigate noise caused by
the diamond surface roughness, which is a source for charge density
fluctuations and incoherent photon scattering. We find that the varying surface
charge density noise source is prevalent throughout the entire NV dynamical
decoupling frequency range, while the photon scattering noise is almost
negligible. Next, we combine the results from various noise sources to perform
comprehensive analyses on T2 and how it varies with NV depth. At a given NV
depth of 5 nm below a hydrogen- or fluorine-terminated surface, we find that
these magnetic nuclei reduce the NV coherence time the most, followed by the
surface electric field noise sources. The photon scattering and bulk magnetic
field noise effects on T2 are weak compared to the varying charge density,
electric dipole, and surface impurity noise. However, with oxygen surface
termination, the surface electric field noise becomes comparable to the surface
magnetic field noise. Our calculated values of T2,Hahn (few microseconds to ten
microseconds) are in good agreement with the experimental values reported
elsewhere. Finally, we calculate an anticipated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for
NV AC magnetometry of external nuclear spins. In our simplified assessment,
where some depth-dependent parameters (e.g. NV conversion efficiency) are held
constant, we find that shallower NV layers should yield the best SNR, which is
consistent with experimental findings.

spectra of PDS 70. Ground-based observations have so far revealed two formative
giant planets orbiting in a wide gap in its circumstellar disk. Both the star
and young planets are thought to still be accreting. The HST spectra provide
new insight into physical conditions in the star's outer atmosphere and
circumstellar environment. The spectra are dominated by chromospheric and
transition region emission lines with maximum formation temperatures log T =
4.5 - 5.2 K. Stellar continuum emission is present in the NUV but we find no
significant FUV continuum, as could arise from accretion shocks. Several
fluorescent FUV H2 emission lines are present, a surprising result since H2
lines are usually undetected in wTTS. The H2 lines likely originate in
irradiated circumstellar gas that could serve as a reservoir for the star's
waning accretion. A previously established correlation between C IV line
luminosity and accretion rate yields $\dot{M}_{acc}$ $\sim$ 10$^{-10}$
$M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, consistent with previous estimates. ALMA disk gas models
imply strong absorption of stellar X-ray and UV (XUV) radiation near the star,

in the context of the semiclassical Schr\""odinger equation that the
computational cost for a class of observables can be much lower than the

constant $h \ll 1$), the operator norm of the Hamiltonian is $O(h^{-1})$. We
show that the number of Trotter steps used for the observable evolution can be
$O(1)$, that is, to simulate some observables of the Schr\""odinger equation on
a quantum scale only takes the simulation time comparable to the classical

Qiskit software stack. Based on real card payment data, a thorough comparison
is performed to assess the complementary impact brought in by the current
state-of-the-art Quantum Machine Learning algorithms with respect to the
Classical Approach. A new method to search for best features is explored using
the Quantum Support Vector Machine's feature map characteristics. The results
are compared using fraud specific key performance indicators: Accuracy, Recall,
and False Positive Rate, extracted from analyses based on human expertise (rule
decisions), classical machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost) and
quantum based machine learning algorithms using QSVM. In addition, a hybrid
classical-quantum approach is explored by using an ensemble model that combines
classical and quantum algorithms to better improve the fraud prevention
decision. We found, as expected, that the results highly depend on feature
selections and algorithms that are used to select them. The QSVM provides a
complementary exploration of the feature space which led to an improved
accuracy of the mixed quantum-classical method for fraud detection, on a
drastically reduced data set to fit current state of Quantum Hardware.

is acid-stable, its applicability is limited by catalytically inactive basal

heterostructure (vdW HTS). The second constituent monolayer Boron Phosphide
(BP) is advantageous as an electrode material owing to its chemical stability
in both oxygen and water environments. Here, we have performed first-principles
based calculations under the framework of density functional theory (DFT) for
HER in an electrochemical double layer model with the BP monolayer, MoS$_2$/BP

has been employed to determine the minimum energy pathways for Tafel and
Heyrovsky reactions. The calculations yield that Tafel reaction shows no
reaction barrier. Thereafter, for Heyrovsky reaction, we have obtained low
reaction barrier in the vdW HTSs as compared to that in the BP monolayer.
Subsequently, we have observed no significant difference in the reaction
profile of MoS$_2$/BP and MoSSe/BP vdW HTSs in case of high coverage (25 %) and
1/3 H$^+$ concentration (conc.). However, in the case of small coverage (11 %)

reaction barrier. Finally, on comparing the coverages with 1/4 H$^+$ conc., we
deduce high coverage with low conc. and low coverage with high conc. to be apt

that will obtained in the future are different from the others? In this work
the aim is to show that a difference in the shadow of some observed black holes
in the future, might explain the $H_0$-tension problem. In this letter we
investigate the possible effects of a pressure cosmological singularity on the
circular photon orbits and the shadow of galactic supermassive black holes at
cosmological redshifts. Since the pressure singularity is a global event in the
Universe, the effects of the pressure singularity will be imposed on
supermassive black holes at a specific redshift. As we show, the pressure
singularity affects the circular photon orbits around cosmological black holes
described by the McVittie metric, and specifically, for some time before the
time instance that the singularity occurs, the photon orbits do not exist. We
discuss the possible effects of the absence of circular photon orbits on the
shadow of these black holes. Our idea indicates that if a pressure singularity
occurred in the near past, then this could have a direct imprint on the shadow
of supermassive galactic black holes at the redshift corresponding to the time
instance that the singularity occurred in the past. Thus, if a sample of
shadows is observed in the future for redshifts $z\leq 0.01$, and for a
specific redshift differences are found in the shadows, this could be an
indication that a pressure singularity occurred, and this global event might
resolve the $H_0$-tension as discussed in previous work. However, the
observation of several shadows at redshifts $z\leq 0.01$ is rather a far future
task.

uniform external flow stream at $M_f=0.15$. We assess the mechanisms that
underpin the reduction in fluctuation energy that is known to occur when a jet
is surrounded by a flight stream. The analysis combines experimental and
numerical databases, spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) and linear
modelling. The experiments involve Time-Resolved, Stereo PIV measurements at
different cross-sections of the jet. A companion large-eddy simulation was
performed with the same operating conditions using the ""CharLES"" solver by
Cascade Technologies in order to obtain a complete and highly resolved 3D
database. We show that the energy reduction is spread over a broad region of
the frequency-wavenumber space and involves, apart from the known stabilization
of the modal Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability, the attenuation of flow
structures associated with the non-modal Orr and lift-up mechanisms. Streaky
structures, associated with helical azimuthal wavenumbers and very slow time
scales, are the most strongly affected by the flight stream, in terms of energy
attenuation and spatial distortion. The energy reductions are accompanied by a
weakening of the low-rank behaviour of the jet dynamics revealed by previous
studies. These trends are found to be consistent with results of a local linear
model based on the modified mean flow in the flight stream case.

carbonaceous grains are presolar graphites, whereas several grains with
moderate C isotopic anomalies are probably organics. The presolar silicate was
located in a clast with a less altered lithology than the typical extensively
aqueously altered Ryugu matrix. The matrix-normalized presolar grain abundances
in Ryugu are 4.8$^{+4.7}_{-2.6}$ ppm for O-anomalous grains, 25$^{+6}_{-5}$ ppm
for SiC grains and 11$^{+5}_{-3}$ ppm for carbonaceous grains. Ryugu is
isotopically and petrologically similar to carbonaceous Ivuna-type (CI)
chondrites. To compare the in situ presolar grain abundances of Ryugu with CI
chondrites, we also mapped Ivuna and Orgueil samples and found a total of SiC

the Ryugu-CI connection. They also reveal intriguing hints of small-scale
heterogeneities in the Ryugu samples, such as locally distinct degrees of

simulate Li$_2$Co$_2$O$_4$ and Co$_2$O$_4$ gas-phase models, which represent
the lithiated and delithiated states during the discharge and the charge of the

benchmarked against the classical wavefunction-based methods, such as
coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) and complete active space

quantitatively agree with the results obtained from CCSD. However, the
comparison against the CASCI results clearly suggests that advanced trial
wavefunctions are likely necessary to capture the multi-reference
characteristics as well as the correlations emerging from high-level electronic

been developed as a unique training paradigm for training machine learning
models on edge devices without access to sensitive data. Traditional FL and
existing methods directly employ aggregation methods on all edges of the same
models and training devices for a cloud server. Although these methods protect
data privacy, they are not capable of model heterogeneity, even ignore the
heterogeneous computing power, and incur steep communication costs. In this
paper, we purpose a resource-aware FL to aggregate an ensemble of local
knowledge extracted from edge models, instead of aggregating the weights of
each local model, which is then distilled into a robust global knowledge as the
server model through knowledge distillation. The local model and the global
knowledge are extracted into a tiny size knowledge network by deep mutual
learning. Such knowledge extraction allows the edge client to deploy a
resource-aware model and perform multi-model knowledge fusion while maintaining
communication efficiency and model heterogeneity. Empirical results show that
our approach has significantly improved over existing FL algorithms in terms of
communication cost and generalization performance in heterogeneous data and

communications. In this paper, we propose a pair of structured quantum
transceiver designs that leverage continuous-variable pre-shared entanglement
generated, e.g., from a down-conversion source, binary phase modulation, and
non-Gaussian joint detection over a code word block, to achieve this scaling
law of capacity enhancement. Further, we describe a modification to the
aforesaid receiver using a front-end that uses sum-frequency generation
sandwiched with dynamically-programmable in-line two-mode squeezers, and a
receiver back-end that takes full advantage of the output of the receiver's
front-end by employing a non-destructive multimode vacuum-or-not measurement to
achieve the entanglement-assisted classical communications capacity.

and the existence of black holes. The remnant of a binary black hole merger
emits gravitational waves in the form of quasinormal modes, whose spectrum is
known as the ""fingerprints"" of a black hole, as it depends only on the
properties of the remnant. The quasinormal modes can be used to test how
closely an astrophysical black hole matches the Kerr geometry. Each mode is
parameterized by three indices: the harmonic numbers $(\ell, m)$ and the
overtone index $n$, that labels the fundamental mode ($n = 0$) and the
overtones ($n = 1,2,3,\ldots$). Black hole spectroscopy is the proposal to use
the detection of multiple quasinormal modes to test the no-hair theorem. In
this work, we investigate the prospects for performing black hole spectroscopy.
The $(2,2,0)$ is the dominant mode, and we analyze the contribution of the most
relevant subdominant modes in numerical relativity simulations. We show that
the overtone mode $(2,2,1)$ has an amplitude higher or comparable to the
amplitude of the most relevant higher harmonic modes. For current and future
gravitational wave detectors, we compute the black hole spectroscopy horizon,
which is the maximum distance of an event up to which two or more quasinormal
modes can be detected. For low mass ratio binaries, the secondary and tertiary
modes are the $(2,2,1)$ and $(3,3,0)$, respectively, and, for the large mass
ratio case, the $(3,3,0)$ and $(4,4,0)$ are the most relevant subdominant modes
for detection. Our work indicates promising prospects for the detection of
subdominant modes with future gravitational wave detectors. The event rate for
LIGO is much smaller, but not prohibitively so.

created on a common substrate infrastructure to support diverse services. A
virtualized network slice is a logical combination of multiple virtual network
functions, which run on virtual machines (VMs) as software applications by
virtualization techniques. As the performance of network slices hinges on the
normal running of VMs, detecting and analyzing anomalies in VMs are critical.
Based on the three-tier management framework of virtualized network slicing, we
first develop a federated learning (FL) based three-tier distributed VM anomaly
detection framework, which enables distributed network slice managers to
collaboratively train a global VM anomaly detection model while keeping metrics
data locally. The high-dimensional, imbalanced, and distributed data features
in virtualized network slicing scenarios invalidate the existing anomaly
detection models. Considering the powerful ability of generative adversarial
network (GAN) in capturing the distribution from complex data, we design a new
multi-discriminator Bidirectional Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty
(BiWGAN-GP) model to learn the normal data distribution from high-dimensional
resource metrics datasets that are spread on multiple VM monitors. The
multi-discriminator BiWGAN-GP model can be trained over distributed data
sources, which avoids high communication and computation overhead caused by the
centralized collection and processing of local data. We define an anomaly score
as the discriminant criterion to quantify the deviation of new metrics data
from the learned normal distribution to detect abnormal behaviors arising in
VMs. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed collaborative anomaly
detection algorithm are validated through extensive experimental evaluation on
a real-world dataset.

(because it is contrary to the most cases currently known), we unambiguously

should be precisely measured by the running LHCb and Belle II experiments,

directional network studies of epilepsy have been mostly limited to
low-dimensional directional networks between the SOZ and contiguous regions due
to the lack of efficient methods for analyzing high-dimensional directional
brain networks. To address this gap, we study high-dimensional directional

autoregressive state-space model (MARSS) to analyze multi-channel intracranial
EEG recordings of focal seizures. This new MARSS characterizes the SOZ, nearby
regions, and many other non-SOZ regions as one integrated high-dimensional
directional network system with a clustering feature. Using the new MARSS, we
reveal changes in high-dimensional directional brain networks throughout
seizure development. We simultaneously identify directional connections and the
SOZ cluster, regions most affected by SOZ activity, in different seizure
periods. We found that, after seizure onset, the numbers of directional
connections of the SOZ and regions in the SOZ cluster increase significantly.
We also reveal that many regions outside the SOZ cluster have no changes in
directional connections, although these regions' EEG data signal ictal
activity. Lastly, we use these high-dimensional network results to localize the
SOZ and achieve 100% true positive rates and less than 3% false positive rates

potential to transform debates about how humans learn language. However, the
learning environments and biases of current artificial learners and humans
diverge in ways that weaken the impact of the evidence obtained from learning
simulations. For example, today's most effective neural language models are
trained on roughly one thousand times the amount of linguistic data available
to a typical child. To increase the relevance of learnability results from
computational models, we need to train model learners without significant
advantages over humans. If an appropriate model successfully acquires some
target linguistic knowledge, it can provide a proof of concept that the target
is learnable in a hypothesized human learning scenario. Plausible model
learners will enable us to carry out experimental manipulations to make causal
inferences about variables in the learning environment, and to rigorously test
poverty-of-the-stimulus-style claims arguing for innate linguistic knowledge in
humans on the basis of speculations about learnability. Comparable experiments
will never be possible with human subjects due to practical and ethical

attempts to deprive current models of unfair advantages obtain sub-human
results for key grammatical behaviors such as acceptability judgments. But
before we can justifiably conclude that language learning requires more prior
domain-specific knowledge than current models possess, we must first explore

interaction as ways to make our learners more efficient at learning from

  In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of supervised learning with

Our method aims to directly search candidate models in the discrete space using
a simple and efficient gradient-based method. Furthermore, we introduce
orthogonal regularity on embedding tables to reduce correlations within

Since users' interests naturally exhibit multiple aspects, it is of increasing
interest to develop multi-interest frameworks for recommendation, rather than

existing methods solely exploit the encoder (the forward flow) to represent
multiple aspects of interests. However, without explicit regularization, the
interest embeddings may not be distinct from each other nor semantically
reflect representative historical items. Towards this end, we propose the Re4
framework, which leverages the backward flow to reexamine each interest
embedding. Specifically, Re4 encapsulates three backward flows, i.e., 1)
Re-contrast, which drives each interest embedding to be distinct from other
interests using contrastive learning; 2) Re-attend, which ensures the
interest-item correlation estimation in the forward flow to be consistent with
the criterion used in final recommendation; and 3) Re-construct, which ensures
that each interest embedding can semantically reflect the information of
representative items that relate to the corresponding interest. We demonstrate
the novel forward-backward multi-interest paradigm on ComiRec, and perform
extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. Empirical studies validate
that Re4 helps to learn learning distinct and effective multi-interest

behaviors, which might render the learned user representation indiscriminating,
and lead to trivial recommendations (e.g., popular items) or even weird ones
that are far beyond users' interests. Contrastive learning is an emergent
technique for learning discriminating representations with random data
augmentations. However, due to neglecting the noises in user behaviors and
treating all augmented samples equally, the existing contrastive learning
framework is insufficient for learning discriminating user representations in
recommendation. To bridge this research gap, we propose the Contrast over
Contrastive Learning framework for training recommender models, named CCL4Rec,
which models the nuances of different augmented views by further contrasting
augmented positives/negatives with adaptive pulling/pushing strengths, i.e.,
the contrast over (vanilla) contrastive learning. To accommodate these
contrasts, we devise the hardness-aware augmentations that track the importance
of behaviors being replaced in the query user and the relatedness of
substitutes, and thus determining the quality of augmented positives/negatives.
The hardness-aware augmentation also permits controllable contrastive learning,
leading to performance gains and robust training. In this way, CCL4Rec captures
the nuances of historical behaviors for a given user, which explicitly shields
off the learned user representation from the effects of noisy behaviors. We
conduct extensive experiments on two micro-video recommendation benchmarks,
which demonstrate that CCL4Rec with far less model parameters could achieve
comparable performance to existing state-of-the-art method, and improve the
training/inference speed by several orders of magnitude.

guessing game between an attack program and a victim program holding a secret.
This guessing game can thus be solved via modern deep RL techniques. AutoCAT
can explore attacks in various cache configurations without knowing design
details and under different attack and victim program configurations. AutoCAT
can also find attacks to bypass certain detection and defense mechanisms. In
particular, AutoCAT discovered StealthyStreamline, a new attack that is able to
bypass performance counter-based detection and has up to a 71% higher
information leakage rate than the state-of-the-art LRU-based attacks on real

prune the predicted distribution by ignoring the options that definitely
violate user constraints and likely result in low-quality layouts, and make the

each track and detection, and efficiently aggregate global information via
attention. We then perform a learned regression on each track/detection feature
pair to estimate affinities, and use a robust two-stage data association and
track management approach to produce the final tracks. We validate our approach
on the nuScenes 3D MOT benchmark, where we observe significant improvements,

respond to each other in a casual style. Detecting the speech activities of

language processing, machine translation, etc. People refer to the detection
technology of ""who speak when"" as speaker diarization (SD). Traditionally,
diarization error rate (DER) has been used as the standard evaluation metric of
SD systems for a long time. However, DER fails to give enough importance to
short conversational phrases, which are short but important on the semantic
level. Also, a carefully and accurately manually-annotated testing dataset
suitable for evaluating the conversational SD technologies is still unavailable
in the speech community. In this paper, we design and describe the
Conversational Short-phrases Speaker Diarization (CSSD) task, which consists of
training and testing datasets, evaluation metric and baselines. In the dataset
aspect, despite the previously open-sourced 180-hour conversational
MagicData-RAMC dataset, we prepare an individual 20-hour conversational speech
test dataset with carefully and artificially verified speakers timestamps

suffer when the source views are affected by blur, which is commonly observed
for images in the wild. Previous deblurring methods either do not account for

works show that backdoor attacks pose a severe security threat to 3D vision
applications. The attacker injects the backdoor into the 3D model by poisoning
a few training samples with trigger, such that the backdoored model performs
well on clean samples but behaves maliciously when the trigger pattern appears.
Existing attacks often insert some additional points into the point cloud as
the trigger, or utilize a linear transformation (e.g., rotation) to construct
the poisoned point cloud. However, the effects of these poisoned samples are
likely to be weakened or even eliminated by some commonly used pre-processing
techniques for 3D point cloud, e.g., outlier removal or rotation augmentation.
In this paper, we propose a novel imperceptible and robust backdoor attack
(IRBA) to tackle this challenge. We utilize a nonlinear and local
transformation, called weighted local transformation (WLT), to construct
poisoned samples with unique transformations. As there are several
hyper-parameters and randomness in WLT, it is difficult to produce two similar
transformations. Consequently, poisoned samples with unique transformations are
likely to be resistant to aforementioned pre-processing techniques. Besides, as
the controllability and smoothness of the distortion caused by a fixed WLT, the
generated poisoned samples are also imperceptible to human inspection.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and four models show that
IRBA achieves 80%+ ASR in most cases even with pre-processing techniques, which
is significantly higher than previous state-of-the-art attacks.

complete set of solutions in de Sitter space, and implement the covariant
canonical quantization which restricts the residual gauge transformation down
to a quantum residual gauge transformation. Then, in the Gupta-Bleuler (GB)
physical state, we calculate the stress tensor which is amazingly independent
of the gauge fixing constant and is also invariant under the quantum residual
gauge transformation.
  The transverse components are simply the same as those in the Minkowski
spacetime, and the transverse vacuum stress tensor has only one UV divergent
term ($\propto k^4$), which becomes zero by the 0th-order adiabatic
regularization. The longitudinal-temporal stress tensor in the GB state is zero
due to a cancelation between the longitudinal and temporal parts. More
interesting is the stress tensor of the GF term. Its particle contribution is
zero due to the cancelation in the GB state, and its vacuum contribution is
twice that of a minimally-coupling massless scalar field, containing $k^4$ and
$k^2$ divergences. After the 2nd-order adiabatic regularization, the GF vacuum
stress tensor becomes zero too, so that there is no need to introduce a ghost
field, and the zero GF vacuum stress tensor can not be a possible candidate for
the cosmological constant. Thus, all the physics predicted by the Maxwell field

Not limited to wannier states, our scheme ensures a dispersionless quantized
transport even for initial Gaussian-like wave packets of interacting bosons
which do not uniformly occupy a given band. This is because the tilting
potential leads to Bloch oscillations uniformly sampling the Berry curvatures
over the entire Brillouin zone. The interplay among on-site potential
difference, tunneling rate and interactions contributes to the topological

high-quality compressed 3D content is even more critical. MPEG recently
developed a video-based point cloud compression (V-PCC) standard for dynamic
point cloud coding. However, reconstructed point clouds using V-PCC suffer from
different artifacts, including losing data during pre-processing before
applying existing video coding techniques, e.g., High-Efficiency Video Coding
(HEVC). Patch generations and self-occluded points in the 3D to the 2D
projection are the main reasons for missing data using V-PCC. This paper
proposes a new method that introduces overlapping slicing as an alternative to
patch generation to decrease the number of patches generated and the amount of
data lost. In the proposed method, the entire point cloud has been
cross-sectioned into variable-sized slices based on the number of self-occluded
points so that data loss can be minimized in the patch generation process and
projection. For this, a variable number of layers are considered, partially
overlapped to retain the self-occluded points. The proposed method's added
advantage is to reduce the bits requirement and to encode geometric data using
the slicing base position. The experimental results show that the proposed
method is much more flexible than the standard V-PCC method, improves the
rate-distortion performance, and decreases the data loss significantly compared
to the standard V-PCC method.

$0.5-0.8$ mag around mid-2020. However, there is no evidence of significant
variation in the corresponding light curve of the optical band from the Zwicky
Transient Facility. This implies that the flare may have been heavily obscured
by nuclear dust. Through follow-up spectroscopic observations with Gemini-North
after the flare, we find that broad emission lines in ${\rm Pa}\alpha$ and
${\rm Pa}\beta$ newly appear, while the broad ${\rm H}\beta$ emission is
marginally detected in the post-flare spectrum. In addition, their central
wavelengths are systematically redshifted up to 900 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to
the narrow emission lines. This reveals that the flare is associated with the
changing-look phenomenon from type 1.8 to type 1. Based on these findings, we
argue that the flare is likely to originate from an obscured tidal disruption
event, although extreme variation in the accretion rate may not be ruled out

naturally extended to a larger domain than that of the classical

need to explicitly track the contact line motion, and difficulties arising from
free boundary problems can be avoided. In addition, topological change events
can be automatically captured. Under some mild and physically meaningful

anti-thermal or non-Arrhenius behavior) have attracted significant interest in
recent years. In this study, we use atomistic simulations to systematically
investigate the effect of driving force on GB mobility based on a set of
bicrystalline models in Ni. It is found that the thermal behavior of GB
migration strongly depends on temperature and the magnitude of driving forces.
When the driving force is at the zero-driving force limit as induced solely by
thermal fluctuations, the mobility of all GBs investigated in the current study
shows a transition from thermally activated to anti-thermal behavior when the
temperature is increased. As the driving force increases, the transition
temperature at which the mobility peaks would gradually decrease so that for
some GBs only the anti-thermal behavior would be detected. Energy analysis
further reveals that the transition temperature (Ttrans) is linearly related to
both energy barrier per area (E) from NEB simulation and the fitted apparent
activation (Q) energy, and both E and Q are lowered as the driving force
increases. Our work supports the previous theoretical models for GB migration
based on both classical thermal activation and disconnection nucleation.
Furthermore, the current study can be used to improve both models by
considering the influence of driving force with a simple fix to how the energy
barrier for GB migration should be considered. It is expected that this work
advances the current understanding of general GB migration and sheds some light
on a unified theoretical framework in the near future.

velocities, accelerates and becomes supersonic. When the flow is directed from
the subsonic to supersonic region, the surface on which the normal component of
fluid velocity equals the local speed of sound acts as an acoustic horizon.
This is because no acoustic perturbation from the supersonic region can cross
it to reach the subsonic part of the fluid. One can show that if the fluid
velocity is locally irrotational, the field equations for acoustic
perturbations of the velocity potential are identical to that of a massless
scalar field propagating in a black hole background. One, therefore, expects
Hawking radiation in the form of a thermal spectrum of phonons. There have been
numerous investigations of this possibility, theoretically, as well as

Presentations dataset as a large-scale benchmark testing the capabilities of
machine learning models in multimodal understanding of educational content. Our
dataset contains aligned slides and spoken language, for 180+ hours of video
and 9000+ slides, with 10 lecturers from various subjects (e.g., computer
science, dentistry, biology). We introduce two research tasks which are
designed as stepping stones towards AI agents that can explain (automatically
captioning a lecture presentation) and illustrate (synthesizing visual figures
to accompany spoken explanations) educational content. We provide manual
annotations to help implement these two research tasks and evaluate
state-of-the-art models on them. Comparing baselines and human student
performances, we find that current models struggle in (1) weak crossmodal
alignment between slides and spoken text, (2) learning novel visual mediums,
(3) technical language, and (4) long-range sequences. Towards addressing this

best pre-trained control filters for various types of noise can achieve a fast
response time. However, it may lead to large steady-state errors due to
inaccurate filter selection and the lack of adaptability. In comparison, the
filtered-X normalized least-mean-square (FxNLMS) algorithm can obtain lower
steady-state errors through adaptive optimization. Nonetheless, its slow
convergence has a detrimental effect on dynamic noise attenuation. Therefore,
this paper proposes a hybrid SFANC-FxNLMS approach to overcome the adaptive

the SFANC method. A lightweight one-dimensional convolutional neural network
(1D CNN) is designed to automatically select the most suitable pre-trained

algorithm continues to update the coefficients of the chosen pre-trained

DNNs are misled to false outputs due to inputs containing imperceptible

multiple orthogonal solution spaces, we leverage a simple and straightforward
multi-branch neural network that eclipses adversarial attacks with no increase
in inference time. We heuristically propose a corresponding loss function,
branch-orthogonal loss, to make each solution space of the multi-branch model
orthogonal. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN against
\ell_{\infty} norm-bounded perturbations of size \epsilon = 8/255,

Therefore, the conventional sign function cannot be well used for effectively
binarizing full-precision values in BNNs. To this end, we present a simple yet
effective approach called AdaBin to adaptively obtain the optimal binary sets
$\{b_1, b_2\}$ ($b_1, b_2\in \mathbb{R}$) of weights and activations for each
layer instead of a fixed set (\textit{i.e.}, $\{-1, +1\}$). In this way, the
proposed method can better fit different distributions and increase the
representation ability of binarized features. In practice, we use the center
position and distance of 1-bit values to define a new binary quantization
function. For the weights, we propose an equalization method to align the
symmetrical center of binary distribution to real-valued distribution, and
minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence of them. Meanwhile, we introduce a

limited kinds of non-visual modality data. This hinders the multi-modal HAR
association as it is unable to simultaneously use both visual and non-visual

multimodal data on wearable devices with their limited computation resources.
In this work, we propose a novel Progressive Skeleton-to-sensor Knowledge

observation or interaction, which are two challenging features of quantum field
theory, become very serious problems in quantum gravity as well as in quantum
geometry of space-time. These problems can be divided into two categories:
technical and conceptual parts. In the technical aspect, the biggest problem
comes from the definition of the point, which constructs classical geometry. By
changing the point definition, the technical problem may be approximately
bypassed, and a mathematical formulation of quantum geometry may be found. On
the other hand, the conceptual problem comes from the quantum state collapse
due to the observation since the entanglement between the observer and gravity
cannot be eliminated in the presence of gravity. The conceptual part does not
depend on the techniques which are employed. As much as possible, we try to
discuss these problems by rediscovering the perception and understanding of a
phenomenon for an observer in quantum theory.

reach-avoid (or, eventuality) properties of continuous-time systems modelled by
ordinary differential equations. Given a system, an initial set, a safe set and
a target set of states, we say that the reach-avoid property holds if for all
initial conditions in the initial set, any trajectory of the system starting at
them will eventually, i.e.\ in unbounded yet finite time, enter the target set
while remaining inside the safe set until that first target hit. Based on a
discount value function, two sets of quantified constraints are derived for
verifying the reach-avoid property via the computation of
exponential/asymptotic guidance-barrier functions (they form a barrier
escorting the system to the target set safely at an exponential or asymptotic
rate). It is interesting to find that one set of constraints whose solution is
termed exponential guidance-barrier functions is just a simplified version of
the existing one derived from the moment based method, while the other one
whose solution is termed asymptotic guidance-barrier functions is completely
new. Furthermore, built upon this new set of constraints, we derive a set of
more expressive constraints, which includes the aforementioned two sets of
constraints as special instances, providing more chances for verifying the
reach-avoid properties successfully. When the involved datum are polynomials,
i.e., the initial set, safe set and target set are semi-algebraic, and the
system has polynomial dynamics, the problem of solving these sets of
constraints can be framed as a semi-definite optimization problem using
sum-of-squares decomposition techniques and thus can be efficiently solved in
polynomial time via interior point methods. Finally, several examples
demonstrate the theoretical developments and performance of proposed methods.

self-interacting scalar field $\phi$ nonminimally coupled to the Ricci scalar
$R$ of the form $F(\phi)R$. The scalar field has a self-interacting potential
and sits at its vacuum expectation value $\phi_v$ far away from the source.
Inside the NS, the dominance of a positive nonminimal coupling over a negative
mass squared of the potential leads to a symmetry restoration with the central
field value $\phi_c$ close to $0$. This allows the existence of scalarized NS
solutions connecting $\phi_v$ with $\phi_c$ whose difference is significant,
whereas the field is located in the vicinity of $\phi=\phi_v$ for weak
gravitational stars. The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass and radius of NSs as well
as the gravitational force around the NS surface can receive sizable
corrections from the scalar hair, while satisfying local gravity constraints in
the Solar system. Unlike the original scenario of spontaneous scalarization
induced by a negative nonminimal coupling, the catastrophic instability of
cosmological solutions can be avoided. We also study the cosmological dynamics
from the inflationary epoch to today and show that the scalar field $\phi$
finally approaches the asymptotic value $\phi_v$ without spoiling a successful
cosmological evolution. After $\phi$ starts to oscillate about the potential
minimum, the same field can also be the source for cold dark matter.

from an $8\times8$ pixel video sequence. Surprisingly, it turns out to be quite
a lot. We show that when we process this $8\times8$ video with the right set of
audio and image priors, we can obtain a full-length, $256\times256$ video. We
achieve this $32\times$ scaling of an extremely low-resolution input using our
novel audio-visual upsampling network. The audio prior helps to recover the
elemental facial details and precise lip shapes and a single high-resolution
target identity image prior provides us with rich appearance details. Our
approach is an end-to-end multi-stage framework. The first stage produces a
coarse intermediate output video that can be then used to animate single target
identity image and generate realistic, accurate and high-quality outputs. Our
approach is simple and performs exceedingly well (an $8\times$ improvement in
FID score) compared to previous super-resolution methods. We also extend our
model to talking-face video compression, and show that we obtain a $3.5\times$
improvement in terms of bits/pixel over the previous state-of-the-art. The

locomotion control strategies to perfectly integrate modeling and control. This
paper presents a kind of control strategy by modeling the bipedal robot as a
flywheel-spring loaded inverted pendulum (F-SLIP) to extract characteristics of
swing arms and using the whole-body controller (WBC) to achieve these

swarms are in a state of scale-free chaos characterized by minimal correlation
time, correlation length proportional to swarm size and topological data

physical quantities characterizing nonlinear-beam propagation. Above the
critical power, the spatial and temporal profiles of the beam deviate from its
original shapes. Therefore, the critical power is considered an important
indicator in nonlinear optical phenomena, such as filamentation and laser
processing. However, although the concept of the critical power has been
established for fundamental waves, it remains unclear if the power-dependent
phenomena can also be observed in harmonic generation because of the complex
interplay of nonlinear-propagation effects and ionization-plasma effects. In
this study, we find the critical power for the third-harmonic generation; the
criterion for whether or not temporal-pulse collapse occurs in the
third-harmonic generation is determined only by the incident power. Experiments
show that a certain incident power exists, at which the third-harmonic power
exerts a specific dependence, independent of the focusing conditions. This
incident power is approximately six times lower than the self-trapping critical
power of the fundamental pulse, which indicates that it is unique to the
third-harmonic generation. Numerical calculations reveal that at this incident
power, the third-harmonic pulse begins to collapse temporally. Furthermore, the
numerical calculations reproduce the experimental results without the nonlinear
effects of the fundamental pulse, dispersion effect, and ionization-plasma
effects. This shows that the pulse collapse is due to the interference effects
from the third-order nonlinear term, which disappears after long-distance
propagation due to phase mismatch, and higher-order nonlinear terms. This study
demonstrates the existence of the critical power for harmonic pulses and show
that higher-order nonlinear effects on the harmonics can yield a universal
phenomenon.

been widely adopted by followers. It was even chosen as the reference model for
the MLPerf training benchmark. The distributed training performance
optimization of BERT models plays an important role in accelerating the
solutions of most NLP tasks. BERT model often uses padding tensors as its
inputs, leading to excessive redundant computations. Thus, removing these
redundant computations is essential to improve the distributed training
performance.
  This paper designs a new approach to train BERT models with variable-length
inputs efficiently. Firstly, we propose a general structure for the
variable-length BERT models, and accelerate the encoder layer via our grouped
multi-stream FMHA (Fused Multi-Head Attention) method. Secondly, through data
exchange, we address the unbalanced workload problem caused by the
variable-length inputs, which overlaps highly with the training process.
Finally, we optimize the overall performance of the BERT model, such as kernel
fusion, and operator optimization. Our experimental results show that our
highly optimized BERT model achieves state-of-the-art throughput and ranks
first in MLPerf Training v2.0 within the same GPU configuration. The
optimizations in this paper can be applied to more BERT-like models in our

cryptosystems enjoy strong worst-case hardness security proofs based on
approximate versions of known NP-hard lattice problems. 5. Lattice-based
cryptosystems are believed to be good candidates for post-quantum cryptography,
since there are currently no known quantum algorithms for solving lattice

introduce a novel neural architecture for GCRL that achieves significantly
better sample efficiency than the commonly-used monolithic network

introduce the metric residual network (MRN) that deliberately decomposes the
action-value function Q(s,a,g) into the negated summation of a metric plus a

task uncertainty. Although a strong prior can be obtained from meta-learning

information while utilizing the disparity information in terms of stereo image
pairs. To alleviate this issue, we propose a stereo superpixel segmentation
method with a decoupling mechanism of spatial information in this work. To
decouple stereo disparity information and spatial information, the spatial
information is temporarily removed before fusing the features of stereo image
pairs, and a decoupled stereo fusion module (DSFM) is proposed to handle the
stereo features alignment as well as occlusion problems. Moreover, since the
spatial information is vital to superpixel segmentation, we further design a
dynamic spatiality embedding module (DSEM) to re-add spatial information, and
the weights of spatial information will be adaptively adjusted through the
dynamic fusion (DF) mechanism in DSEM for achieving a finer segmentation.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the
state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI2015 and Cityscapes datasets, and also
verify the efficiency when applied in salient object detection on NJU2K

pollutants or virus particles, the dynamics of tracer-like to low inertial
particles are significantly altered by the fluctuating motion of the carrier
fluid phase. Neglecting the effects of fluid velocity fluctuations on particle
dynamics causes poor prediction of particle transport and dispersion. To
account for the effects of fluid phase fluctuating velocity on the particle
transport, stochastic differential equations coupled with large-eddy simulation
are proposed to model the fluid velocity seen by the particle. The drift and
diffusion terms in the stochastic differential equation are modelled using
neural networks ('neural stochastic differential equations'). The neural
networks are trained with direct numerical simulations (DNS) of decaying
homogeneous isotropic turbulence at low and moderate Reynolds numbers. The
predictability of the proposed models are assessed against DNS results through
a priori analyses and a posteriori simulations of decaying homogeneous
isotropic turbulence at low-to-high Reynolds numbers. Total particle
fluctuating kinetic energy is under-predicted by 40% with no model, compared to
the DNS data. In contrast, the proposed model predictions match total particle
fluctuating kinetic energy to within 5% of the DNS data for low to high-inertia
particles. For inertial particles, the model matches the variance of
uncorrelated particle velocity to within 10% of DNS results, compared to 60-70%
under-prediction with no model. It is concluded that the proposed model is

performance compared to those having GaAs shell. AlGaAs shell acts as a strong
barrier restricting most of the photogeneration to the inner GaAs regions and
it also acts as a strong passivation layer, reducing the recombination losses
due to surface effects. Further, it is observed that the nanocones achieve
their highest photoconversion efficiency when they are sparsely packed, with a
constant i-shell thickness of 7-9 nm and have an angle of tilt of 5 degrees.
This enhanced performance is attributed to a more effective and extended
photogeneration throughout the nanowire length, a strong overlapping built-in
electric field, and lower recombination losses.

observe all other robots as long as there are no restrictions for visibility
range or obstructions, regardless of the number of robots. In this paper, we
provide a new perspective on the observation by robots; a robot cannot
necessarily observe all other robots regardless of distances to them. We call
this new computational model defected view model. Under this model, in this
paper, we consider the gathering problem that requires all the robots to gather
at the same point and propose two algorithms to solve the gathering problem in
the adversarial ($N$,$N-2$)-defected model for $N \geq 5$ (where each robot
observes at most $N-2$ robots chosen adversarially) and the distance-based
(4,2)-defected model (where each robot observes at most 2 closest robots to
itself) respectively, where $N$ is the number of robots. Moreover, we present
an impossibility result showing that there is no (deterministic) gathering
algorithm in the adversarial or distance-based (3,1)-defected model. Moreover,
we show an impossibility result for the gathering in a relaxed ($N$,

of deep learning methods have been proposed to support radiologists
interpreting radiographs. Mostly, these approaches rely on convolutional neural

classification of pathologies on chest radiographs (Chest X-Rays, CXR), CNNs
have proven to be well suited. On the Contrary, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
not been applied to this task despite their high classification performance on
generic images and interpretable local saliency maps which could add value to
clinical interventions. ViTs do not rely on convolutions but on patch-based
self-attention and in contrast to CNNs, no prior knowledge of local
connectivity is present. While this leads to increased capacity, ViTs typically
require an excessive amount of training data which represents a hurdle in the
medical domain as high costs are associated with collecting large medical data
sets. In this work, we systematically compare the classification performance of
ViTs and CNNs for different data set sizes and evaluate more data-efficient ViT

identical, additive valuations but individual budget constraints. Here, the
indivisible goods--each with a specific size and value--need to be allocated
such that the bundle assigned to each agent is of total size at most the
agent's budget. Since envy-free allocations do not necessarily exist in the
indivisible goods context, compelling relaxations--in particular, the notion of
envy-freeness up to $k$ goods (EFk)--have received significant attention in
recent years. In an EFk allocation, each agent prefers its own bundle over that
of any other agent, up to the removal of $k$ goods, and the agents have
similarly bounded envy against the charity (which corresponds to the set of all
unallocated goods). Recently, Wu et al. (2021) showed that an allocation that
satisfies the budget constraints and maximizes the Nash social welfare is
$1/4$-approximately EF1. However, the computation (or even existence) of exact
EFk allocations remained an intriguing open problem.
  We make notable progress towards this by proposing a simple, greedy,
polynomial-time algorithm that computes EF2 allocations under budget
constraints. Our algorithmic result implies the universal existence of EF2
allocations in this fair division context. The analysis of the algorithm
exploits intricate structural properties of envy-freeness. Interestingly, the
same algorithm also provides EF1 guarantees for important special cases.
Specifically, we settle the existence of EF1 allocations for instances in
which: (i) the value of each good is proportional to its size, (ii) all goods
have the same size, or (iii) all the goods have the same value. Our EF2 result
extends to the setting wherein the goods' sizes are agent specific.

Calculating the expected improvement can help create stopping rules for

exploited by a number of selfish investors, a situation known as the tragedy of
the commons (TOC). Without regulations, agents optimize the size of their
individual investments into the commons by balancing incurring costs with the
returns received. The resulting Nash equilibrium involves a self-consistency
loop between individual investment decisions and the state of the commons. As a
consequence, several non-trivial properties emerge. For $N$ investing actors we
prove rigorously that typical payoffs do not scale as $1/N$, the expected
result for cooperating agents, but as $(1/N)^2$. Payoffs are hence reduced with
regard to the functional dependence on $N$, a situation denoted catastrophic
poverty. We show that catastrophic poverty results from a fine-tuned balance
between returns and costs. Additionally, a finite number of oligarchs may be
present. Oligarchs are characterized by payoffs that are finite and not
decreasing when $N$ increases. Our results hold for generic classes of models,
including convex and moderately concave cost functions. For strongly concave
cost functions the Nash equilibrium undergoes a collective reorganization,
being characterized instead by entry barriers and sudden death forced market

vulnerabilities present in the codebase? To yield a deeper understanding of
this important kind of vulnerability, we perform two main analyses: one on
attack gadgets, i.e., exploitable pieces of code, present in Java libraries,
and one on vulnerabilities present in Java applications. For the first
analysis, we conduct an exploratory large-scale study by running 256515
experiments in which we vary the versions of libraries for each of the 19
publicly available exploits. Such attacks rely on a combination of gadgets
present in one or multiple Java libraries. A gadget is a method which is using
objects or fields that can be attacker-controlled. Our goal is to precisely
identify library versions containing gadgets and to understand how gadgets have
been introduced and how they have been patched. We observe that the
modification of one innocent-looking detail in a class -- such as making it
public -- can already introduce a gadget. Furthermore, we noticed that among
the studied libraries, 37.5% are not patched, leaving gadgets available for
future attacks. For the second analysis, we manually analyze 104
deserialization vulnerabilities CVEs to understand how vulnerabilities are
introduced and patched in real-life Java applications. Results indicate that
the vulnerabilities are not always completely patched or that a workaround

defined in terms of a Riesz interaction kernel. These MFG systems describe Nash
equilibria of games with a large population of indistinguishable rational
players attracted toward regions where the population is highly distributed.
Equilibria solve a system of PDEs where an Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is
combined with a Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equation for the mass distribution.
Due to the interplay between the strength of the attractive term and the
behavior of the diffusive part, we will obtain three different regimes for the
existence and non existence of classical solutions to the MFG system. By means
of a Pohozaev-type identity, we prove nonexistence of regular solutions to the
MFG system without potential in the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev-supercritical
regime. On the other hand, using a fixed point argument, we show existence of
classical solutions in the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev-subcritical regime at least
for masses smaller than a given threshold value. In the mass-subcritical regime
we show that actually this threshold can be taken to be $+\infty$.

materials against rigid substrates moving at constant velocity. Despite the
non-conservative behavior of the system, the closure equation of the contact
problem can be rigorously formulated in the form of a local energy balance. In
the case of adhesiveless contacts, this is equivalent to enforce the
stationarity of the total energy stored into the viscoelastic material.
However, in the presence of interfacial adhesion, the appearance of
non-conservative terms leads to different values of the energy release rates G1
and G2 at the contact trailing and leading edges, respectively. Specifically,
the present theory predicts a non-monotonic trend of G1 and G2 as function of
the indenter velocity, as well as a very significant enhancement of hysteretic
friction due to the coupling between adhesion and viscoelasticity, compared to
the adhesiveless case. Both predictions are in very good agreement with
existing experimental data.

high-dimensional datasets, e.g. images. This makes high-quality GANs useful for
unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. However, differences in
training datasets such as output image dimensionality and appearance of
semantically meaningful features mean that GAN models from the natural image
domain may not work `out-of-the-box' for medical imaging, necessitating
re-implementation and re-evaluation. In this work we adapt and evaluate three
GAN models to the task of modelling 3D healthy image patches for pulmonary CT.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such an evaluation
has been performed. The DCGAN, styleGAN and the bigGAN architectures were
investigated due to their ubiquity and high performance in natural image
processing. We train different variants of these methods and assess their
performance using the FID score. In addition, the quality of the generated
images was evaluated by a human observer study, the ability of the networks to
model 3D domain-specific features was investigated, and the structure of the
GAN latent spaces was analysed. Results show that the 3D styleGAN produces
realistic-looking images with meaningful 3D structure, but suffer from mode
collapse which must be addressed during training to obtain samples diversity.
Conversely, the 3D DCGAN models show a greater capacity for image variability,
but at the cost of poor-quality images. The 3D bigGAN models provide an
intermediate level of image quality, but most accurately model the distribution
of selected semantically meaningful features. The results suggest that future
development is required to realise a 3D GAN with sufficient capacity for
patch-based lung CT anomaly detection and we offer recommendations for future
areas of research, such as experimenting with other architectures and
incorporation of position-encoding.

implement their responsiveness to the external stimuli. One of the factors that
improves the emulsion stability is the nanogel softness. Here, we study how the
softest nanogels that can be synthesised with precipitation polymerisation of
N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM), the ultra-low crosslinked (ULC) nanogels,
stabilise oil-in-water emulsions. We show that ULC nanogels can efficiently
stabilise emulsions already at low mass concentrations. These emulsions are
resistant to droplet flocculation, stable against coalescence, and can be
easily broken upon an increase in temperature. The resistance to flocculation
of the ULC-stabilised emulsion droplets is similar to the one of emulsions
stabilised by linear pNIPAM. In contrast, the stability against coalescence and
the temperature-responsiveness closely resemble the one of emulsions stabilised
by regularly crosslinked pNIPAM nanogels. The reason for this combination of
properties is that ULC nanogels can be thought of as colloids in between
flexible macromolecules and particles. As a polymer, ULC nanogels can
efficiently stretch at the interface and cover it uniformly. As a regularly
crosslinked nanogel particle, ULC nanogels protect emulsion droplets against
coalescence by providing a steric barrier and rapidly respond to changes in
external stimuli thus breaking the emulsion. This polymer-particle duality of
ULC nanogels can be exploited to improve the properties of emulsions for
various applications, for example in heterogeneous catalysis or in food
science.

under-damping across a critical-damping. We propose that the mechanical

highly sensitive optomechanical sensing can be realized around the EPs for

that software is used to generate safety-relevant behavior of the machinery but

rules for selecting safety measures depending on the SIL. In this paper, we
argue that this approach can hardly be adopted with respect to ML and other

are sufficient in the given case. To get a first rating regarding the

  Approach","12 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.SI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph anomaly detection on attributed networks has become a prevalent
research topic due to its broad applications in many influential domains. In
real-world scenarios, nodes and edges in attributed networks usually display
distinct heterogeneity, i.e. attributes of different types of nodes show great
variety, different types of relations represent diverse meanings. Anomalies
usually perform differently from the majority in various perspectives of
heterogeneity in these networks. However, existing graph anomaly detection
approaches do not leverage heterogeneity in attributed networks, which is
highly related to anomaly detection. In light of this problem, we propose
AHEAD: a heterogeneity-aware unsupervised graph anomaly detection approach
based on the encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, for the encoder, we
design three levels of attention, i.e. attribute level, node type level, and
edge level attentions to capture the heterogeneity of network structure, node
properties and information of a single node, respectively. In the decoder, we
exploit structure, attribute, and node type reconstruction terms to obtain an
anomaly score for each node. Extensive experiments show the superiority of
AHEAD on several real-world heterogeneous information networks compared with
the state-of-arts in the unsupervised setting. Further experiments verify the
effectiveness and robustness of our triple attention, model backbone, and

challenging uneven terrain navigation on raw point cloud maps. Unlike
techniques based on Digital Elevation Maps (DEMs), our novel surfel-based
state-space formulation and implementation are based on raw point cloud maps,
allowing for the modeling of overlapping surfaces such as bridges, piers, and
tunnels. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method
for robot navigation in real and simulated unstructured environments. The
proposed approach also optimizes planners' performances by boosting their
success rates up to 5x for challenging unstructured terrain planning and

sufficiently large external strains, which in turn plays major roles in
determining the mechanical stability and functionality of living systems. We
present a complete scaling theory of the critical strain-stiffened state in

singular perturbation applied to the stiff anisotropic backbone corresponding
to fibers' stretching/compression. The critical state features quartic
anharmonicity, from which a set of nonlinear scaling relations for various
fundamental biophysical quantities are derived. These results, which are

cosmology and fundamental physics. However, the radio signal of lensed FRBs
will be deflected by plasma in lens galaxies in addition to gravity. Such
deflections by both gravity and plasma will cause frequency dependent time
delays, which are different from the dispersion delay and the geometric delay
caused by gravitational lensing. Depending on the lensing and plasma models,
the frequency-time delay relation of the lensed images can show distinguishing
behaviours either between the multiple images, or from the dispersion relation.
Such phenomena cannot be neglected in future studies, especially at low radio
frequency, as plasma exists in lens galaxies in general. More importantly, such
information provides not only a potential way to search for lensed FRBs, but
also constraints on the mass and plasma distributions in lens galaxy. In

$\Omega\big(\min\big\{\frac{\log\Delta}{\log\log\Delta},\sqrt{\frac{\log

$\Theta(\log n)$, even on bounded-degree graphs. We show that the problem can
be solved deterministically with node-averaged complexity $O(\log^* n)$, while
keeping the worst-case complexity in $O(\log n)$.

detects the radiation phase-sensitively and allows to determine the
magnetization alignment. Our scanning technique with motorized stages with step
sizes in the sub-micrometer range, allows to image two dimensional magnetic
structures. Theoretically the resolution is restricted to half of the
wavelength if focusing optics in the far-field limit are used. By applying
near-field imaging, the spatial resolution is enhanced to the single digit
micrometer range. For this purpose, spintronic emitters in diverse geometric
shapes, e.g. circles, triangles, squares, and sizes are prepared to observe the
formation of magnetization patterns. The alignment of the emitted THz radiation
can be influenced by applying unidirectional external magnetic fields. We
demonstrate how magnetic domains with opposite alignment and different shapes
divided by domain walls are created by demagnetizing the patterns using minor
loops and imaged using phase sensitive THz radiation detection. For analysis,
the data is compared to Kerr microscope images. The possibility to combine this
method with THz range spectroscopic information of magnetic texture or
antiferromagnets in direct vicinity to the spintronic emitter, makes this
detection method interesting for much wider applications probing THz excitation
in spin systems with high resolution beyond the Abbe diffraction limit, limited
solely by the laser excitation area.

  System","Paper got accepted to Oral ECCV workshop (CVCIE)",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although the smart camera parking system concept has existed for decades, a
few approaches have fully addressed the system's scalability and reliability.
As the cornerstone of a smart parking system is the ability to detect
occupancy, traditional methods use the classification backbone to predict spots
from a manual labeled grid. This is time-consuming and loses the system's
scalability. Additionally, most of the approaches use deep learning models,
making them not error-free and not reliable at scale. Thus, we propose an
end-to-end smart camera parking system where we provide an autonomous detecting
occupancy by an object detector called OcpDet. Our detector also provides
meaningful information from contrastive modules: training and spatial
knowledge, which avert false detections during inference. We benchmark OcpDet
on the existing PKLot dataset and reach competitive results compared to
traditional classification solutions. We also introduce an additional SNU-SPS
dataset, in which we estimate the system performance from various views and
conduct system evaluation in parking assignment tasks. The result from our
dataset shows that our system is promising for real-world applications.

with maximal closeness to the semantics of the input data. We propose an
approach (called FSYNTH) that leverages lightweight error-feedback and input
synthesis to repair invalid inputs. FSYNTH is grammar-agnostic, and it does not

FSYNTH provides a set of repairs prioritized by the distance of the repair from
the original input. We evaluate FSYNTH on 806 (real-world) invalid inputs using
four well-known input formats, namely INI, TinyC, SExp, and cJSON. In our

also highly effective and efficient in input repair: It repairs 77% of invalid

sequential games is of paramount importance in practice. Indeed, it is well
known that the NE has several weaknesses, since it may prescribe to play
sub-optimal actions in those parts of the game that are never reached at the
equilibrium. NE refinements, such as the extensive-form perfect equilibrium
(EFPE), amend such weaknesses by accounting for the possibility of players'
mistakes. This is crucial in real-world applications, where bounded rationality
players are usually involved, and it turns out being useful also in boosting
the performances of superhuman agents for recreational games like Poker.
Nevertheless, only few works addressed the problem of computing NE refinements.
Most of them propose algorithms finding exact NE refinements by means of linear
programming, and, thus, these do not have the potential of scaling up to
real-world-size games. On the other hand, existing iterative algorithms that
exploit the tree structure of sequential games only provide convergence
guarantees to approximate refinements. In this paper, we provide the first
efficient last-iterate algorithm that provably converges to an EFPE in
two-player zero-sum sequential games with imperfect information. Our algorithm
works by tracking a sequence of equilibria of suitably-defined,
regularized-perturbed games. In order to do that, it uses a procedure that is
tailored to converge last-iterate to the equilibria of such games. Crucially,
the updates performed by such a procedure can be performed efficiently by
visiting the game tree, thus making our algorithm potentially more scalable
than its linear-programming-based competitors. Finally, we evaluate our
algorithm on a standard testbed of games, showing that it produces strategies
which are much more robust to players' mistakes than those of state-of-the-art
NE-computation algorithms.

  Reinforcement Learning Approach",,,,,"cs.IT cs.AI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a semantic communication framework is proposed for textual
data transmission. In the studied model, a base station (BS) extracts the
semantic information from textual data, and transmits it to each user. The
semantic information is modeled by a knowledge graph (KG) that consists of a
set of semantic triples. After receiving the semantic information, each user
recovers the original text using a graph-to-text generation model. To measure
the performance of the considered semantic communication framework, a metric of
semantic similarity (MSS) that jointly captures the semantic accuracy and
completeness of the recovered text is proposed. Due to wireless resource
limitations, the BS may not be able to transmit the entire semantic information
to each user and satisfy the transmission delay constraint. Hence, the BS must
select an appropriate resource block for each user as well as determine and
transmit part of the semantic information to the users. As such, we formulate
an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the total MSS by jointly
optimizing the resource allocation policy and determining the partial semantic
information to be transmitted. To solve this problem, a
proximal-policy-optimization-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
integrated with an attention network is proposed. The proposed algorithm can
evaluate the importance of each triple in the semantic information using an
attention network and then, build a relationship between the importance
distribution of the triples in the semantic information and the total MSS.
Compared to traditional RL algorithms, the proposed algorithm can dynamically
adjust its learning rate thus ensuring convergence to a locally optimal
solution.

aligned with human intent. Our exhaustive experiments demonstrate that ILLUME
is competitive with standard supervised finetuning while using significantly

emission in UV-selected galaxies at $z\sim7$, to investigate the dust content

fraction of obscured star formation $f_\mathrm{obs} = \mathrm{SFR}_\mathrm{IR}

observed at lower redshift, and ranges from $f_\mathrm{obs} \approx 0.3 - 0.6$

wanting to discover causal relationships from observational data. While most
previous approaches to causal discovery have implicitly assumed that no expert

knowledge from prior experience. Recent work has incorporated domain knowledge
into constraint-based causal discovery. The majority of such constraint-based
methods, however, assume causal faithfulness, which has been shown to be
frequently violated in practice. Consequently, there has been renewed attention
towards exact-search score-based causal discovery methods, which do not assume
causal faithfulness, such as A*-based methods. However, there has been no
consideration of these methods in the context of domain knowledge. In this
work, we focus on efficiently integrating several types of domain knowledge
into A*-based causal discovery. In doing so, we discuss and explain how domain
knowledge can reduce the graph search space and then provide an analysis of the
potential computational gains. We support these findings with experiments on

based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter (mm/submm) Array (ALMA)
continuum observations at 230 GHz. This search is based on a new
self-calibration algorithm, especially designed for variability detection in
the GC field. Using this method, we have performed a search of radio transients
in the effective field of view of~$\sim 30\,$arcseconds of the GC central
supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (SgrA*) using ALMA 230 GHz observations
taken during the 2017 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) campaign, which span
several observing hours (5-10) on 2017 April 6, 7, and 11. This calibration
method allows one to disentangle the variability of unresolved SgrA* from any
potential transient emission in the wider field of view and residual effects of
the imperfect data calibration. Hence, a robust statistical criterion to
identify real transients can be established: the event should survive at least
three times the correlation time and it must have a peak excursion of at least
seven times the instantaneous root-mean-square between consecutive images. Our
algorithms are successfully tested against realistic synthetic simulations of
transient sources in the GC field. Having checked the validity of the
statistical criterion, we provide upper limits for transient activity in the

most $(1+\epsilon)\cdot \frac{n}{k}$ each, while minimizing the cost of the
partitioning, defined as the number of cut hyperedges, possibly also weighted
by the number of partitions they intersect. We show that this problem cannot be
approximated to within a $n^{1/\text{poly} \log\log n}$ factor of the optimal
solution in polynomial time if the Exponential Time Hypothesis holds, even for
hypergraphs of maximal degree 2. We also study the hardness of the partitioning
problem from a parameterized complexity perspective, and in the more general
case when we have multiple balance constraints.
  Furthermore, we consider two extensions of the partitioning problem that are
motivated from practical considerations. Firstly, we introduce the concept of
hyperDAGs to model precedence-constrained computations as hypergraphs, and we
analyze the adaptation of the balanced partitioning problem to this case.
Secondly, we study the hierarchical partitioning problem to model hierarchical
NUMA (non-uniform memory access) effects in modern computer architectures, and
we show that ignoring this hierarchical aspect of the communication cost can
yield significantly weaker solutions.

apply the stochastic search procedures to an open qutrit system and

large for relatively strong system-bath coupling strength and high bath

underlying mechanism of multimodal pre-training models still remains a grand
challenge. Revealing the explainability of such models is likely to enable
breakthroughs of novel learning paradigms in the AI field. To this end, given
the multimodal nature of the human brain, we propose to explore the
explainability of multimodal learning models with the aid of non-invasive brain
imaging technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
Concretely, we first present a newly-designed multimodal foundation model
pre-trained on 15 million image-text pairs, which has shown strong multimodal
understanding and generalization abilities in a variety of cognitive downstream
tasks. Further, from the perspective of neural encoding (based on our
foundation model), we find that both visual and lingual encoders trained
multimodally are more brain-like compared with unimodal ones. Particularly, we
identify a number of brain regions where multimodally-trained encoders
demonstrate better neural encoding performance. This is consistent with the
findings in existing studies on exploring brain multi-sensory integration.
Therefore, we believe that multimodal foundation models are more suitable tools
for neuroscientists to study the multimodal signal processing mechanisms in the
human brain. Our findings also demonstrate the potential of multimodal
foundation models as ideal computational simulators to promote both
AI-for-brain and brain-for-AI research.

including serum-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE), total IgE, skin prick tests
(SPTs), comorbidities, sex, and age. Using these features, multiple machine
learning models were constructed to predict OFC outcomes for three common

was an ensemble of random forest (egg) or Learning Using Concave and Convex

learned models can reveal sensitive information about their training data. Many
works have investigated the effect of widely-adopted data augmentation (DA) and
adversarial training (AT) techniques, termed data enhancement in the paper, on
the privacy leakage of machine learning models. Such privacy effects are often
measured by membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether
a particular example belongs to the training set or not. We propose to
investigate privacy from a new perspective called memorization. Through the
lens of memorization, we find that previously deployed MIAs produce misleading
results as they are less likely to identify samples with higher privacy risks
as members compared to samples with low privacy risks. To solve this problem,
we deploy a recent attack that can capture individual samples' memorization
degrees for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we unveil non-trivial
findings about the connections between three essential properties of machine
learning models, including privacy, generalization gap, and adversarial
robustness. We demonstrate that, unlike existing results, the generalization
gap is shown not highly correlated with privacy leakage. Moreover, stronger
adversarial robustness does not necessarily imply that the model is more
susceptible to privacy attacks.

the next two decades. Around the middle of the 21st century model and scenario
uncertainty become the dominant contribution in the tropics but internal

of 5G systems because it imposes very strict Quality of Service (QoS)
requirements related to throughput, latency, and reliability. A high-resolution
AR/VR flow requires a bandwidth of dozens of MHz. Since the existing
low-frequency bands (i.e., below 6 GHz) have limited bandwidth and are
overpopulated, one of the ways to satisfy high AR/VR demands is to use wide
frequency channels available in the millimeter-Wave (mmWave) band. However,
transmission in the mmWave band suffers from high throughput fluctuation and
even blockage, which leads to violation of strict AR/VR latency and reliability
requirements. To address this problem, 5G specifications introduce a
Multi-Connectivity (MC) feature that allows a mobile user to connect
simultaneously to several base stations. The paper considers a scenario with
two base stations: the first base station operates in the low-frequency band to
provide reliable data delivery, while the second one operates in the mmWave
band and offers high data rates when the channel conditions are favorable. An
open question that falls out of the scope of specifications is how to balance
AR/VR traffic between two links with different characteristics. The paper
proposes a Delay-Based Traffic Balancing (DBTB) algorithm that minimizes
resource consumption of the low-frequency link while satisfying strict AR/VR
QoS requirements. With extensive simulations, DBTB is shown to double the
network capacity for AR/VR traffic compared with the state-of-the-art traffic
balancing algorithms.

concerned with just treatment of individuals and sensitive groups (e.g., based
on sex, race). While many studies focus on fair learning and fairness testing
for the classification tasks, the literature is rather limited on how to
examine fairness in regression tasks. This work presents error parity as a
regression fairness notion and introduces a testing methodology to assess group
fairness based on a statistical hypothesis testing procedure. The error parity
test checks whether prediction errors are distributed similarly across
sensitive groups to determine if an ADS is fair. It is followed by a suitable
permutation test to compare groups on several statistics to explore disparities
and identify impacted groups. The usefulness and applicability of the proposed
methodology are demonstrated via a case study on COVID-19 projections in the US

unlabeled data to reduce the risk by increasing the exposure of the model to
varying distribution shifts. Specifically, we propose a novel Multi-Grained
Consistency Regularization (MGCR) method to make use of unlabeled data and
design two filters specifically for TOWE to filter noisy data at different
granularity. Extensive experimental results on four TOWE benchmark datasets
indicate the superiority of MGCR compared with current state-of-the-art

monoliths with locked configurations or reconfigurable mechanical linkages.
This work introduces a transformable topological mechanical metamaterial (TTMM)
made from a shape memory polymer and based on a generalized kagome lattice. It
is capable of reversibly exploring topologically distinct phases of the
non-trivial phase space via a kinematic strategy that converts sparse
mechanical inputs at free edge pairs into a biaxial, global transformation that
switches its topological state. Thanks to the shape memory effect, all
configurations are stable even in the absence of confinement or a continuous
mechanical input. Topologically-protected mechanical behaviors, while robust
against structural (with broken hinges) or conformational defects (up to ~55%
mis-rotations), are shown to be vulnerable to the adverse effects of stored
elastic energy from prior transformations (up to a ~70% reduction in edge
stiffness ratios, depending on hinge width). Interestingly, we show that shape
memory polymer's intrinsic phase transitions that modulate chain mobility can
effectively shield a dynamic metamaterial's topological response (with a 100%
recovery) from its own kinematic stress history, an effect we refer to as
""stress caching"".

tomography (CBCT) scanning. Metal implants inserted into the anatomy cause
severe artifacts in reconstructed images. Widely used inpainting-based metal
artifact reduction (MAR) methods require segmentation of metal traces in the

a deep learning method to segment metals in the projections. However, the
success of deep learning methods is limited by the availability of realistic
training data. It is challenging and time consuming to get reliable ground
truth annotations due to unclear implant boundary and large number of
projections. We propose to use X-ray simulations to generate synthetic metal
segmentation training dataset from clinical CBCT scans. We compare the effect
of simulations with different number of photons and also compare several
training strategies to augment the available data. We compare our model's
performance on real clinical scans with conventional threshold-based MAR and a
recent deep learning method. We show that simulations with relatively small
number of photons are suitable for the metal segmentation task and that
training the deep learning model with full size and cropped projections
together improves the robustness of the model. We show substantial improvement
in the image quality affected by severe motion, voxel size under-sampling, and
out-of-FOV metals. Our method can be easily implemented into the existing
projection-based MAR pipeline to get improved image quality. This method can
provide a novel paradigm to accurately segment metals in CBCT projections.

CCTEST features a set of novel mutation strategies, namely program

completion outputs by selecting the output that mostly reflects the ""average""

the conditional moment restrictions can be severely ill-posed as well as admit
multiple solutions. This is sometimes resolved by imposing strong conditions

by increasing the attention mechanism, which commonly includes:

location features between channels or within channels, but fail to perceive the
differences between input images. In this paper, we propose a novel image
difference attention network (IDAN). In the image preprocessing stage, we use a
pre-training model to extract the feature differences between two input images

obtain the edge difference map (ED-map). In the image feature extracting stage,
the FD-map and ED-map are input to the feature difference attention module and
edge compensation module, respectively, to optimize the features extracted by
IDAN. Finally, the change detection result is obtained through the feature
difference operation. IDAN comprehensively considers the differences in
regional and edge features of images and thus optimizes the extracted image
features. The experimental results demonstrate that the F1-score of IDAN
improves 1.62% and 1.98% compared to the baseline model on WHU dataset and

it even more challenging since the outputs could be multi-modal. The

straightforward cases but usually fail to restore the contextual information in
the absence of clear figure-ground separation. Also, the images suffer from
color bleeding and desaturated backgrounds since a single model trained on full
image features is insufficient for learning the diverse data modes. To address
these issues, we present a parallel GAN-based colorization framework. In our
approach, each separately tailored GAN pipeline colorizes the foreground (using
object-level features) or the background (using full-image features). The
foreground pipeline employs a Residual-UNet with self-attention as its
generator trained using the full-image features and the corresponding
object-level features from the COCO dataset. The background pipeline relies on
full-image features and additional training examples from the Places dataset.
We design a DenseFuse-based fusion network to obtain the final colorized image
by feature-based fusion of the parallelly generated outputs. We show the
shortcomings of the non-perceptual evaluation metrics commonly used to assess
multi-modal problems like image colorization and perform extensive performance
evaluation of our framework using multiple perceptual metrics. Our approach
outperforms most of the existing learning-based methods and produces results

a new complexity measure for Ising models and thoroughly classify Ising models

problem corresponding to the function graph of its Hamiltonian, and classify
this problem in the Chomsky hierarchy. We prove that the language of this

PASTEL, which directly optimizes the information propagation path and solves
the topology-imbalance issue in essence. Our key insight is to enhance the
connectivity of nodes within the same class for more supervision information,
thereby relieving the under-reaching and over-squashing phenomena.
Specifically, we design an anchor-based position encoding mechanism, which
better incorporates relative topology position and enhances the intra-class
inductive bias by maximizing the label influence. We further propose a
class-wise conflict measure as the edge weights, which benefits the separation
of different node classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
potential and adaptability of PASTEL in enhancing GNNs' power in different data
annotation scenarios.

but have brightened significantly in the radio flux (by a factor of >5) in the
epoch I (2017-2019) observations of Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). All
the 18 galaxies have been detected in the epoch II VLASS observations in
2020-2021, for which the radio flux is found to evolve slowly (by a factor of
~40%) over a period of about three years. 15 galaxies have been observed in the
Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, and a flat or inverted spectral slope between 888
MHz and 3 GHz is found. Based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra taken
before the radio brightening, 14 out of 18 can be classified to be LINERs or
normal galaxies with weak or no nuclear activity. Most galaxies are red and
massive, with more than half having central black hole masses above 10^8Msun.
We find that only one galaxy in our sample displays optical flare lasting for
at least two months, and a long decay in the infrared light curve that can be
explained as the dust-heated echo emission of central optical flare, such as a
stellar tidal disruption event. We discuss several possibilities for the
transient radio emission and conclude that it is likely associated with a
new-born radio jet triggered by short sporadic fueling of supermassive black
hole. Such a scenario can be tested with further multi-frequency radio
observations of these sources through measuring their radio flux variability

during the AGB phase by analysing results from observations of single post-AGB
stars in the Magellanic Clouds. We also aim at reconstruct dust formation
processes, that are active in the circumstellar envelope of AGB stars. Methods:
We study likely single post-AGB sources in the Magellanic Clouds that exhibit a
double-peaked (shell-type) spectral energy distribution (SED). We interpret
their SED by comparing with results from radiative transfer calculations, to
derive the luminosity and the dust content of the individual sources.
Additionally, we compare the observationally derived stellar parameters and the
photospheric chemical abundances of the target sample with results from stellar
evolution modelling of AGB and post-AGB stars. This allows for the
characterization of the individual sources in terms of initial mass and
formation epoch of the progenitors. Results: We find that amongst our target
sample of 13 likely single post-AGB stars with shell-type SED, 8 objects are
carbon stars descending from ~1-2.5 Msun progenitors. 5 of the 13 objects are
of lower mass, descending from M<1 Msun stars. Based on the dust mineralogy, we
find that these 5 stars are surrounded by silicate dust, and thus failed to
become carbon stars. The dust optical depth and the luminosity of the stars are
correlated, owing to the faster evolutionary time-scale brighter stars, which
makes the dusty layer to be closer to the central object. From our detailed
analysis of the SEDs, we deduce that the dust currently observed around
post-AGB stars was released after the onset of the central star contraction and
an increase in the effective temperature to ~3500-4000 K.

enhancement remains at ~1.6 dB via optimizing the first splitting ratio when
the loss rate changes from 0% to 90%, indicating that the quantum resource is

manipulate public opinion and spread misinformation. Research efforts have been
made to automatically identify bots based on texts and networks on social
media. Existing methods only leverage texts or networks alone, and while few
works explored the shallow combination of the two modalities, we hypothesize
that the interaction and information exchange between texts and graphs could be
crucial for holistically evaluating bot activities on social media. In
addition, according to a recent survey (Cresci, 2020), Twitter bots are
constantly evolving while advanced bots steal genuine users' tweets and dilute
their malicious content to evade detection. This results in greater
inconsistency across the timeline of novel Twitter bots, which warrants more
attention. In light of these challenges, we propose BIC, a Twitter Bot
detection framework with text-graph Interaction and semantic Consistency.
Specifically, in addition to separately modeling the two modalities on social
media, BIC employs a text-graph interaction module to enable information
exchange across modalities in the learning process. In addition, given the
stealing behavior of novel Twitter bots, BIC proposes to model semantic
consistency in tweets based on attention weights while using it to augment the
decision process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BIC consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two widely adopted datasets. Further
analyses reveal that text-graph interactions and modeling semantic consistency
are essential improvements and help combat bot evolution.

several NaCl crystallographic planes by means of the Mold Integration
technique, a highly efficient computational method to evaluate interfacial free
energies with anisotropic crystal resolution. Making use of the JC-SPC/E model,
one of the most benchmarked force fields for NaCl/water solutions, we measure
the interfacial free energy of four different planes, (100), (110), (111), and
(11-2) with the saturated solution at normal conditions. We find high
anisotropy between the different crystal orientations with values ranging from
100 to 150 mJ/m2 and the average value of the distinct planes being 137(20)
mJ/m2. This value for the coexistence interfacial free energy is in reasonable
agreement with previous extrapolations from nucleation studies. Our work
represents a milestone in the computational calculation of interfacial free
energies between ionic crystals and aqueous solutions.

formation of quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions. Despite significant
efforts, the separate identification of quark and gluon jet quenching has
remained as a challenge. Here we show that $J/\psi$ in high transverse momentum
($p_T$) region provides a uniquely sensitive probe of in-medium gluon energy
loss since its production at high $p_T$ is particularly dominated by gluon
fragmentation. Such gluon-dominance is first demonstrated for the baseline of
proton-proton collisions within the framework of leading power NRQCD
factorization formalism. We then use the linear Boltzmann transport model
combined with hydrodynamics for the simulation of jet-medium interaction in
nucleus-nucleus collisions. The satisfactory description of experimental data
on both nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and elliptic flow $v_2$ reveals,
for the first time, that the gluon jet quenching is the driving force for high
$p_T$ $J/\psi$ suppression. This novel finding is further confirmed, in a
robust and model-independent way, by the data-driven Bayesian analyses of
relevant experimental measurements, from which we also obtain the first
quantitative extraction of the gluon energy loss distribution in the
quark-gluon plasma.

of processing through traces of past information in the system's collective
dynamics. The extent of memory about past inputs is commonly quantified by the
autocorrelation time of collective dynamics. Based on past experimental
evidence, a potential explanation for the underlying autocorrelations are
close-to-critical fluctuations. Here, we show for self-organized networks of
excitatory and inhibitory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons that
autocorrelations can originate from emergent bistability upon reducing external
input strength. We identify the bistability as a fluctuation-induced stochastic
switching between metastable active and quiescent states in the vicinity of a
non-equilibrium phase transition. This bistability occurs for networks with
fixed heterogeneous weights as a consequence of homeostatic self-organization
during development. Specifically, in our experiments on neuromorphic hardware
and in computer simulations, the emergent bistability gives rise to
autocorrelation times exceeding 500 ms despite single-neuron timescales of only
20 ms. Our results provide the first verification of biologically compatible
autocorrelation times in networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, which
here are not generated by close-to-critical fluctuations but by emergent
bistability in homeostatically regulated networks. Our results thereby
constitute a new, complementary mechanism for emergent autocorrelations in
networks of spiking neurons, with implications for biological and artificial

bistability for driven systems with absorbing states.

a canonical scalar field where now the second derivative of the Gauss-Bonnet
scalar coupling function appears and effectively alters the numerical value of
the scalar potential. The appearance of such term is reminiscing of a $\lambda
R$ model of gravity where $\lambda$ is now dynamical. We consider two viable
inflationary models of interest, the former involves an error function as
scalar Gauss-Bonnet coupling function and the latter a Woods-Saxon scalar
potential. It is shown that for both models the aforementioned quantities can
be in agreement with theoretical expectations. The only constraint that is
needed is the assumption that the second time derivative of the Gauss-Bonnet
scalar coupling function is actually lesser than the Planck mass squared, that
is $\ddot\xi<\frac{M_{Pl}^2}{8}$ in order to obtain a viable description. We
find that a free parameter of the theory and specifically the potential

effective equations of state and therefore the reheating epoch can be described
either by a type of stiff matter with EoS parameter equal to unity or by an EoS

regularity of weak solutions of the Euler equations, was completely resolved in
recent years. In this work, we pursue an analogue of Onsager's conjecture in
the context of the hydrostatic Euler equations (also known as the inviscid
primitive equations of oceanic and atmospheric dynamics). In this case the
relevant conserved quantity is the horizontal kinetic energy.
  We first consider the standard notion of weak solution which is commonly used
in the literature. We show that if the horizontal velocity $(u,v)$ is
sufficiently regular then the horizontal kinetic energy is conserved.
Interestingly, the spatial H\""older regularity exponent which is sufficient for
energy conservation in the context of the hydrostatic Euler equations is
$\frac{1}{2}$ and hence larger than the corresponding regularity exponent for
the Euler equations (which is $\frac{1}{3}$).
  This is due to the anisotropic regularity of the velocity field: Unlike the
Euler equations, in the case of the hydrostatic Euler equations the vertical
velocity $w$ is one degree spatially less regular with respect to the
horizontal variables, compared to the horizontal velocity $(u,v)$. Since the
standard notion of weak solution is not able to deal with this anisotropy
properly, we introduce two new notions of weak solutions for which the vertical
part of the nonlinearity is interpreted as a paraproduct. We finally prove
several sufficient conditions for such weak solutions to conserve energy.

this method to be both calibrated and sharp under the assumption of independent

this method can be readily applied to trained neural network force fields with
traditional and graph neural network architectures to obtain estimates of
uncertainty with low computational costs on a training dataset of 1 million

to measure whether a process, or algorithm, may unintentionally produce unfair
outcomes, as well as whether or how the potential unfairness of such processes
can be mitigated. Statistical discrimination describes a set of informational
issues that can induce rational (i.e., Bayesian) decision-making to lead to
unfair outcomes even in the absence of discriminatory intent. In this article,
we provide overviews of these two related literatures and draw connections
between them. The comparison illustrates both the conflict between rationality
and fairness and the importance of endogeneity (e.g., ""rational expectations""
and ""self-fulfilling prophecies"") in defining and pursuing fairness. Taken in
concert, we argue that the two traditions suggest a value for considering new
fairness notions that explicitly account for how the individual characteristics
an algorithm intends to measure may change in response to the algorithm.

(DeepJSCC) has led to a new paradigm of semantic communications. Two salient
features of DeepJSCC-based semantic communications are the exploitation of
semantic-aware features directly from the source signal, and the discrete-time
analog transmission (DTAT) of these features. Compared with traditional digital
communications, semantic communications with DeepJSCC provide superior
reconstruction performance at the receiver and graceful degradation with
diminishing channel quality, but also exhibit a large peak-to-average power
ratio (PAPR) in the transmitted signal. An open question has been whether the
gains of DeepJSCC come from the additional freedom brought by the high-PAPR
continuous-amplitude signal. In this paper, we address this question by
exploring three PAPR reduction techniques in the application of image
transmission. We confirm that the superior image reconstruction performance of
DeepJSCC-based semantic communications can be retained while the transmitted
PAPR is suppressed to an acceptable level. This observation is an important
step towards the implementation of DeepJSCC in practical semantic communication
systems.

(open classes). We define Open Long-Tailed Recognition++ (OLTR++) as learning
from such naturally distributed data and optimizing for the classification
accuracy over a balanced test set which includes both known and open classes.
OLTR++ handles imbalanced classification, few-shot learning, open-set
recognition, and active learning in one integrated algorithm, whereas existing
classification approaches often focus only on one or two aspects and deliver
poorly over the entire spectrum. The key challenges are: 1) how to share visual
knowledge between head and tail classes, 2) how to reduce confusion between
tail and open classes, and 3) how to actively explore open classes with learned
knowledge. Our algorithm, OLTR++, maps images to a feature space such that
visual concepts can relate to each other through a memory association mechanism
and a learned metric (dynamic meta-embedding) that both respects the closed
world classification of seen classes and acknowledges the novelty of open
classes. Additionally, we propose an active learning scheme based on visual

However, DL-based solutions can be vulnerable to overfitting and the resulting
inability to generalise to images captured by different colonoscopes. Recent
transformer-based architectures for semantic segmentation both achieve higher

fixed-filter active noise control (SFANC) method appears to be a viable
candidate for widespread use in a variety of practical active noise control
(ANC) systems. In comparison to conventional fixed-filter ANC methods, SFANC
can select the pre-trained control filters for different types of noise. Deep
learning technologies, thus, can be used in SFANC methods to enable a more
flexible selection of the most appropriate control filters for attenuating
various noises. Furthermore, with the assistance of a deep neural network, the
selecting strategy can be learned automatically from noise data rather than
through trial and error, which significantly simplifies and improves the
practicability of ANC design. Therefore, this paper investigates the
performance of SFANC based on different one-dimensional and two-dimensional
convolutional neural networks. Additionally, we conducted comparative analyses
of several network training strategies and discovered that fine-tuning could
improve selection performance.

expansion scalar $\theta \left( t\right) $ is proportional to the shear scalar
$\sigma \left( t\right) $ which leads to the relation between the metric

behavior of the deceleration parameter predicts a transition from deceleration

diverse and critical applications in smart cities. Existing works mostly
perform consecutive predictions of following steps with observations completely
and continuously obtained, where nearest observations can be exploited as key
knowledge for instantaneous status estimation. However, the practical issues of
early activity planning and sensor failures elicit a brand-new task, i.e.,
non-consecutive forecasting. In this paper, we define spatiotemporal learning
systems with missing observation as Grey Spatiotemporal Systems (G2S) and
propose a Factor-Decoupled learning framework for G2S (FDG2S), where the core
idea is to hierarchically decouple multi-level factors and enable both flexible
aggregations and disentangled uncertainty estimations. Firstly, to compensate
for missing observations, a generic semantic-neighboring sequence sampling is
devised, which selects representative sequences to capture both periodical
regularity and instantaneous variations. Secondly, we turn the predictions of
non-consecutive statuses into inferring statuses under expected combined
exogenous factors. In particular, a factor-decoupled aggregation scheme is
proposed to decouple factor-induced predictive intensity and region-wise
proximity by two energy functions of conditional random field. To infer
region-wise proximity under flexible factor-wise combinations and enable
dynamic neighborhood aggregations, we further disentangle compounded influences
of exogenous factors on region-wise proximity and learn to aggregate them.
Given the inherent incompleteness and critical applications of G2S, a
DisEntangled Uncertainty Quantification is put forward, to identify two types
of uncertainty for reliability guarantees and model interpretations.

combines statistics and data-driven approaches with dynamical modeling to
assess long-term fairness effects of labor market interventions. Specifically,
we develop and use a model to investigate the impact of decisions caused by a
public employment authority that selectively supports job-seekers through
targeted help. The selection of who receives what help is based on a
data-driven intervention model that estimates an individual's chances of
finding a job in a timely manner and rests upon data that describes a
population in which skills relevant to the labor market are unevenly
distributed between two groups (e.g., males and females). The intervention
model has incomplete access to the individual's actual skills and can augment
this with knowledge of the individual's group affiliation, thus using a
protected attribute to increase predictive accuracy. We assess this
intervention model's dynamics -- especially fairness-related issues and
trade-offs between different fairness goals -- over time and compare it to an
intervention model that does not use group affiliation as a predictive feature.
We conclude that in order to quantify the trade-off correctly and to assess the
long-term fairness effects of such a system in the real-world, careful modeling
of the surrounding labor market is indispensable.

strategies that focus on the viral capsid and outwards, rather than on the
nucleic acids inside. These approaches fall into two broad categories:
whole-virus vaccines and subunit vaccines. Whole-virus vaccines use the virus
itself, either in an inactivated or attenuated state. Subunit vaccines contain
instead an isolated, immunogenic component of the virus. Here, we highlight
vaccine candidates that apply these approaches against SARS-CoV-2 in different

development of nucleic-acid based vaccine technologies. We further consider the
role that these COVID-19 vaccine development programs have played in
prophylaxis at the global scale. Well-established vaccine technologies have
proved especially important to making vaccines accessible in low- and
middle-income countries. Vaccine development programs that use established
platforms have been undertaken in a much wider range of countries than those

countries. Therefore, these vaccine platforms, though less novel from a

provided by quantum dots (QDs) as optical gain materials, we have realized
highly-compact active BIC resonators with a record-high quality ($Q$) factor up
to 32500, which enables single-mode continuous wave (CW) lasing with the lowest
threshold of 80 W/cm$^{2}$ among the reported BIC lasers. In addidtion, our
photon statistics measurements under both CW and pulsed excitations confirm the
occurence of the phase transition from spontaneous emission to stimulated
emission, further suggesting that conventional criteria of input-output and
linewidth are not sufficient for claiming nanoscale lasing. Our work reveal a
via path towards compact BIC lasers with ultra-low power consumption and
potentially boost the applications in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QEDs),
nonlinear optics and integrated photonics.

obtaining service the customer is active for a period of time whose random
duration depends on the service type: the longer service type enables longer
activity time. Users can choose a service type every time they are in service,
and we are interested in the system efficiency which is the average number of
active users. Applications include but are not limited to inventory control,
electrical vehicle charging, mobile robotics charging, and machine maintenance.
We prove that choosing the more efficient service is not always optimal. We
demonstrate that if we constrain the strategy to be a threshold strategy
depending on the number of inactive users, then the resulting maximal
efficiency is not significantly lower than the maximal efficiency. We also
study individuals' optimal selection of the service type, and observe that
individuals and the manager have opposite incentives: when the queue is long,
individuals choose the long service, while the manager prefers the short
service in this case.

virtual classrooms, assessments, online tests and transformed the classroom an
into interactive online classroom. Despite the large number of online degrees
offered, face-to-face remained the dominant mode and e-learning was just used
to complement the classroom. The Covid-19 pandemic continues to impact higher
education, and online learning is a forgone conclusion. However, the digital
divide hindered the disadvantaged schools and students efforts to transition to
online learning. As the pandemic continues to change the education landscape,
many challenges arise and prevent student from realising the full potential of
e-learning. One of those is the access to physical labs in science,
engineering, and computer science programs. This study evaluates practical
solutions for virtual labs to be used in teaching information security and
ethical hacking. The course ran over five semesters, and 164 students were

Newton's arguments, and about the same period, based on empirical measurements,
they emitted another theory, claiming that on the contrary, the Earth has the

interpretability for human users, i.e., their outcomes (and, even more so,

regions, taking into account complex changing environmental conditions. The
method allows the construction of optimised routes, describing the three main
stages of the process: discrete modelling of the environmental conditions using
a non-uniform mesh, the construction of mesh-optimal paths, and path smoothing.
In order to account for different vehicle properties we construct a series of
data driven functions that can be applied to the environmental mesh to
determine the speed limitations and fuel requirements for a given vessel and
mesh cell, representing these quantities graphically and geospatially. In
describing our results, we demonstrate an example use case for route planning
for the polar research ship the RRS Sir David Attenborough (SDA), accounting
for ice-performance characteristics and validating the spatial-temporal route
construction in the region of the Weddell Sea, Antarctica. We demonstrate the
versatility of this route construction method by demonstrating that routes
change depending on the seasonal sea ice variability, differences in the
route-planning objective functions used, and the presence of other
environmental conditions such as currents. To demonstrate the generality of our
approach, we present examples in the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea. The
techniques outlined in this manuscript are generic and can therefore be applied
to vessels with different characteristics. Our approach can have considerable
utility beyond just a single vessel planning procedure, and we outline how this
workflow is applicable to a wider community, e.g. commercial and passenger
shipping.

optimization or functional fit. We demonstrate the power of the circuit
construction in examples of multivariable integration on the unit hypercube in
up to 50 dimensions, where the complexity of integration can be understood from
the circuit structure. We find very favorable cost scaling compared to
quasi-Monte-Carlo integration for these cases, and further give an example
where efficient quasi-Monte-Carlo cannot be theoretically performed without
