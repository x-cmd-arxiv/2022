  machine learning with classical data","29 pages",,,,"quant-ph cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite years of effort, the quantum machine learning community has only been
able to show quantum learning advantages for certain contrived
cryptography-inspired datasets in the case of classical data. In this note, we
discuss the challenges of finding learning problems that quantum learning
algorithms can learn much faster than any classical learning algorithm, and we
study how to identify such learning problems. Specifically, we reflect on the
main concepts in computational learning theory pertaining to this question, and
we discuss how subtle changes in definitions can mean conceptually
significantly different tasks, which can either lead to a separation or no
separation at all. Moreover, we study existing learning problems with a
provable quantum speedup to distill sets of more general and sufficient
conditions (i.e., ``checklists'') for a learning problem to exhibit a
separation between classical and quantum learners. These checklists are
intended to streamline one's approach to proving quantum speedups for learning
problems, or to elucidate bottlenecks. Finally, to illustrate its application,
we analyze examples of potential separations (i.e., when the learning problem
is build from computational separations, or when the data comes from a quantum
experiment) through the lens of our approach.

  and terminology were added",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work solves an open question in finite-state compressibility posed by
Lutz and Mayordomo about compressibility of real numbers in different bases.
  Finite-state compressibility, or equivalently, finite-state dimension,
quantifies the asymptotic lower density of information in an infinite sequence.
Absolutely normal numbers, being finite-state incompressible in every base of
expansion, are precisely those numbers which have finite-state dimension equal
to $1$ in every base. At the other extreme, for example, every rational number
has finite-state dimension equal to $0$ in every base.
  Generalizing this, Lutz and Mayordomo (2021) posed the question: are there
numbers which have absolute positive finite-state dimension strictly between 0
and 1 - equivalently, is there a real number $\xi$ and a compressibility ratio
$s \in (0,1)$ such that for every base $b$, the compressibility ratio of the
base-$b$ expansion of $\xi$ is precisely $s$? It is conceivable that there is
no such number. Indeed, some works explore ``zero-one'' laws for other feasible
dimensions - i.e. sequences with certain properties either have feasible
dimension 0 or 1, taking no value strictly in between.
  However, we answer the question of Lutz and Mayordomo affirmatively by
proving a more general result. We show that given any sequence of rational
numbers $\langle q_b \rangle$, we can explicitly construct a single number
$\xi$ such that for any base $b$, the finite-state dimension/compression ratio
of $\xi$ in base-$b$ is $q_b$. As a special case, this result implies the
existence of absolutely dimensioned numbers for any given rational dimension
between $0$ and $1$, as posed by Lutz and Mayordomo.
  In our construction, we combine ideas from Wolfgang Schmidt's construction of
absolutely normal numbers (1962), results regarding low discrepancy sequences
and several new estimates related to exponential sums.

sketching and actuated tangible user interfaces (TUI) for bidirectional
sketching interaction. Bi-directional sketching enables virtual sketches and
physical objects to ""affect"" each other through physical actuation and digital
computation. In the existing AR sketching, the relationship between virtual and
physical worlds is only one-directional -- while physical interaction can
affect virtual sketches, virtual sketches have no return effect on the physical
objects or environment. In contrast, bi-directional sketching interaction
allows the seamless coupling between sketches and actuated TUIs. In this paper,
we employ tabletop-size small robots (Sony Toio) and an iPad-based AR sketching
tool to demonstrate the concept. In our system, virtual sketches drawn and
simulated on an iPad (e.g., lines, walls, pendulums, and springs) can move,
actuate, collide, and constrain physical Toio robots, as if virtual sketches
and the physical objects exist in the same space through seamless coupling
between AR and robot motion. This paper contributes a set of novel interactions
and a design space of bi-directional AR sketching. We demonstrate a series of
potential applications, such as tangible physics education, explorable
mechanism, tangible gaming for children, and in-situ robot programming via

typically uniformly distributed on $(0,1)$ under least favorable parameter
configurations (LFCs) in the null hypothesis. Conservativeness of a $p$-value
$P$ (meaning that $P$ is under the null hypothesis stochastically larger than a
random variable which is uniformly distributed on $(0,1)$) can occur if the
test statistic from which $P$ is derived is discrete, or if the true parameter
value under the null is not an LFC. To deal with both of these sources of
conservativeness, we present two approaches utilizing randomized $p$-values,
namely single-stage and two-stage randomization. We illustrate their
effectiveness for testing a composite null hypothesis under a binomial model.
We also give an example of how the proposed $p$-values can be used to test a
composite null in group testing designs. Similar to previous findings, we find
that the proposed randomized $p$-values are less conservative compared to
non-randomized $p$-values under the null hypothesis, but that they are
stochastically not smaller under the alternative. The problem of establishing
the validity of randomized $p$-values is not trivial and has received attention
in previous literature. We show that our proposed randomized $p$-values are
valid under various discrete statistical models which are such that the
distribution of the corresponding test statistic belongs to an exponential
family. The behaviour of the power function for the tests based on the proposed
randomized $p$-values as a function of the sample size is also investigated.
Simulations and a real data analysis are used to compare the different

application in practically all vehicles, both on- and off-road, a universal
analytical model that captures the essential shock absorber dynamics and
compressibility effects for various common damper architectures is lacking.
This paper presents such a model and derives its system of equations from first
principles for dampers of monotube- and piggyback-type. By applying the model
to a typical suspension configuration, all relevant system variables, such as
pressure drop, shim stack deflection, and damping force, are computed.
Nonlinear oscillations and hysteresis loops, which might prove dangerous during
operation, can be predicted effortlessly. The results achieved with the
mathematical model are validated and agree well with test bench measurements.
Furthermore, the presented approach is shown to be easily modifiable to

  http://oa.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/dailinglong/publications/publications.html",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spatial division multiple access (SDMA) is essential to improve the spectrum
efficiency for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications.
The classical SDMA for massive MIMO with hybrid precoding heavily relies on the
angular orthogonality in the far field to distinguish multiple users at
different angles, which fails to fully exploit spatial resources in the
distance domain. With the dramatically increasing number of antennas, the
extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA) introduces additional resolution in
the distance domain in the near field. In this paper, we propose the concept of
location division multiple access (LDMA) to provide a new possibility to
enhance spectrum efficiency compared with classical SDMA. The key idea is to
exploit extra spatial resources in the distance domain to serve different users
at different locations (determined by angles and distances) in the near field.
Specifically, the asymptotic orthogonality of near-field beam focusing vectors
in the distance domain is proved, which reveals that near-field beam focusing
is able to focus signals on specific locations with limited leakage energy at
other locations. This special property could be leveraged in hybrid precoding
to mitigate inter-user interferences for spectrum efficiency enhancement.
Moreover, we provide the spherical-domain codebook design method for LDMA
communications with the uniform planar array, which provides the sampling
method in the distance domain. Additionally, performance analysis of LDMA is
provided to reveal that the asymptotic optimal spectrum efficiency could be
achieved with the increasing number of antennas. Finally, simulation results
verify the superiority of the proposed LDMA over SDMA in different scenarios.

self-supervised representation learning by recovering corrupted image patches.
However, most existing studies operate on low-level image pixels, which hinders
the exploitation of high-level semantics for representation models. In this
work, we propose to use a semantic-rich visual tokenizer as the reconstruction
target for masked prediction, providing a systematic way to promote MIM from
pixel-level to semantic-level. Specifically, we propose vector-quantized
knowledge distillation to train the tokenizer, which discretizes a continuous
semantic space to compact codes. We then pretrain vision Transformers by
predicting the original visual tokens for the masked image patches.
Furthermore, we introduce a patch aggregation strategy which associates
discrete image patches to enhance global semantic representation. Experiments
on image classification and semantic segmentation show that BEiT v2 outperforms
all compared MIM methods. On ImageNet-1K (224 size), the base-size BEiT v2
achieves 85.5% top-1 accuracy for fine-tuning and 80.1% top-1 accuracy for
linear probing. The large-size BEiT v2 obtains 87.3% top-1 accuracy for
ImageNet-1K (224 size) fine-tuning, and 56.7% mIoU on ADE20K for semantic

feedback communication from the central processor to external sensors. Using
simple but representative state-estimation examples, we investigate fundamental
tradeoffs between the mean-squared error (MSE) of the central processor's
estimate of the environment state, and the total power expenditure per sensor
under more conventional architectures without feedback (INformation) versus
those with broadcast feedback (OUTformation). The primary advantage of enabling
feedback is that each sensor's understanding of the central processor's
estimate improves, which enables each sensor to determine when and what parts
of its current observations to transmit. We use theory to demonstrate
conditions in which OUTformation maintains the same MSE as INformation with
less power expended on average, and conditions in which OUTformation obtains
less MSE than INformation at additional power cost. These performance tradeoffs
are also considered under settings where environments undergo less variation,
and sensors implement random backoff times to prevent transmission collisions.
Our results are supported via numerical studies, which show that the properties
derived in theory still hold even when some of the simplifying assumptions are
removed.

the hottest stars ($T_{\rm eff} = 8500 \pm 150 \, {\rm K}$) to host a known
sub-Jovian planet. HD 56414 b lies on the boundary of the hot Neptune desert in
planet radius -- bolometric insolation flux space, suggesting that the planet
may be experiencing mass loss. To explore this, we apply a photoevaporation
model that incorporates the high near ultraviolet continuum emission of A-type
stars. We find that the planet can retain most of its atmosphere over the
typical 1-Gyr main sequence lifetime of an A-type star if its mass is $\ge 8 \,
M_\oplus$. Our model also predicts that close-in Neptune-size planets with
masses $< 14 \, M_\oplus$ are susceptible to total atmospheric stripping over 1
Gyr, hinting that the hot Neptune desert, which has been previously observed
around FGKM-type stars, likely extends to A-type stars.

partition the embedding tables into multiple devices. However, the embedding

significant design challenge of distributed systems named embedding table
sharding, i.e., how we should partition the embedding tables to balance the
costs across devices, which is a non-trivial task because 1) it is hard to
efficiently and precisely measure the cost, and 2) the partition problem is
known to be NP-hard. In this work, we introduce our novel practice in Meta,
namely AutoShard, which uses a neural cost model to directly predict the
multi-table costs and leverages deep reinforcement learning to solve the
partition problem. Experimental results on an open-sourced large-scale
synthetic dataset and Meta's production dataset demonstrate the superiority of
AutoShard over the heuristics. Moreover, the learned policy of AutoShard can
transfer to sharding tasks with various numbers of tables and different ratios
of the unseen tables without any fine-tuning. Furthermore, AutoShard can
efficiently shard hundreds of tables in seconds. The effectiveness,
transferability, and efficiency of AutoShard make it desirable for production

expect that they allow generalization in downstream tasks. It is however well
known that such identifiability guaranties are typically not achievable without

Independent Component Analysis, in which the LVM maps statistically independent
variables to observations via a deterministic nonlinear function. Several
families of spurious solutions fitting perfectly the data, but that do not
correspond to the ground truth factors can be constructed in generic settings.
However, recent work suggests that constraining the function class of such
models may promote identifiability. Specifically, function classes with
constraints on their partial derivatives, gathered in the Jacobian matrix, have
been proposed, such as orthogonal coordinate transformations (OCT), which
impose orthogonality of the Jacobian columns. In the present work, we prove
that a subclass of these transformations, conformal maps, is identifiable and

are promising materials for next-generation electronic and spintronic
applications. Of magnetic TSMs, Weyl nodal-line (NL) semimetals likely have the
most tunability, and yet they are the least experimentally studied so far due
to the scarcity of material candidates. Here, using a combination of
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and quantum oscillation measurements,
together with density functional theory calculations, we identify the
square-net compound EuGa4 as a new magnetic Weyl nodal ring (NR) semimetal, in
which the line nodes form closed rings in the vicinity of the Fermi level.
Remarkably, the Weyl NR states show distinct Landau quantization with clear
spin splitting upon application of a magnetic field. At 2 K in a field of 14 T,
the transverse magnetoresistance of EuGa4 exceeds 200,000%, which is more than
two orders of magnitude larger than that of other known magnetic TSMs. High
field magnetoresistance measurements indicate no saturation up to 40 T. Our
theoretical model indicates that the nonsaturating MR naturally arises as a
consequence of the Weyl NR state. Our work thus point to the realization of
Weyl NR states in square-net magnetic materials, and opens new avenues for the
design of magnetic TSMs with very large magnetoresistance.

drifting along the superradiance threshold, in which case the evolution of its
parameters can be described analytically or semi-analytically. We quantify the
conditions under which accretion can serve as a mechanism to increase the
cloud-to-black hole mass ratio, beyond the standard maximum of about 10%. This
occurs by a process we call over-superradiance, whereby accretion effectively
feeds the superradiance cloud, by way of the black hole. We give two explicit
examples: accretion from a vortex expected in wave dark matter and accretion
from a baryonic disk. In the former case, we estimate the accretion rate by
using an analytical fit to the asymptotic behavior of the confluent Heun

present a method of reconstructing all-sky information of the Galactic magnetic
field component parallel to the line of sight, $B_{\parallel}$, using simulated
observations of the RM and DM along lines of sight to radio galaxies and FRB
populations, respectively. This technique is capable of distinguishing between
different input Galactic magnetic field and thermal electron density models.
Significant extragalactic contributions to the DM are the predominant
impediment in accurately reconstructing the Galactic DM and

Overall, we are able to reconstruct both large-scale Galactic structure and
local features in the Milky Way's magnetic field from the assumed models. We
discuss the application of this technique to future FRB observations and
address possible differences between our simulated model and observed data,

recommended by NASA's 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey, have a
diffraction-limited resolution that effectively spreads light from a source in
a region around the source point. In this letter, we show that the diffraction

objects, such as other planets and moons, can influence obtained spectra for a
putative habitable planet by producing spurious features and adding additional
uncertainty in the spectra. A model of the Earth observed by a 6 meter space

enhancement depending on the position of a dipole emitter relative to the air
holes. The highest Purcell factors and chirality occur in separate regions, but
there is still a significant area where high values of both can be obtained.
Based on this, we first demonstrate a record large radiative decay rate of 17
ns^-1 (60 ps lifetime) corresponding to a 20 fold Purcell enhancement. This was
achieved by electric-field tuning of the QD to the slow-light region and
quasi-resonant phonon-sideband excitation. We then demonstrate a 5 fold Purcell
enhancement for a dot with high degree of chiral coupling to waveguide modes,
substantially surpassing all previous measurements. Together these demonstrate
the excellent prospects for using QDs in scalable implementations of on-chip
spin-photonics relying on chiral quantum optics.

thousands of nuclear masses. To keep such large-scale fits feasible, several
symmetry restrictions are generally imposed on the nuclear configurations. One
such example is time-reversal invariance, which is generally enforced via the
Equal Filling Approximation (EFA). Here we lift this assumption, enabling us to
access the spin and current densities in the ground states of odd-mass and
odd-odd nuclei and which contribute to the total energy of such nuclei through
so-called ""time-odd"" terms. We present here the Skyrme-based BSkG2 model whose

characteristic scale defined by the distribution peak; centrality distributions
exhibit a skewed two-tail distribution with power law decay on each side of the

at intersections for traffic surveillance applications. The proposed framework
consists of three hierarchical steps, including efficient and accurate object
detection based on the state-of-the-art YOLOv4 method, object tracking based on
Kalman filter coupled with the Hungarian algorithm for association, and
accident detection by trajectory conflict analysis. A new cost function is
applied for object association to accommodate for occlusion, overlapping
objects, and shape changes in the object tracking step. The object trajectories
are analyzed in terms of velocity, angle, and distance in order to detect
different types of trajectory conflicts including vehicle-to-vehicle,
vehicle-to-pedestrian, and vehicle-to-bicycle. Experimental results using real
traffic video data show the feasibility of the proposed method in real-time
applications of traffic surveillance. In particular, trajectory conflicts,
including near-accidents and accidents occurring at urban intersections are
detected with a low false alarm rate and a high detection rate. The robustness

effect of subtracting antibodies from the vaccine arm. We focus on the case
when individuals in the placebo arm are unlikely to have the needed antibodies.
In that case, if a standard assumption (given confounders, potential mediators

strongly depend on the quality of the particle beams produced by such machines.
Indeed, state-of-the-art applications in photon production and high-energy
physics colliders require to use very high brightness electron beams, implying
the coexistence of high peak currents and small transverse emittances. In such
systems, the nominal phase-space density may be diluted by the presence of
self-induced electromagnetic fields, causing interaction among charged
particles through space charge forces and the excitation of wakefields. The two
sources of collective effects may both be present in significant levels, and be
coupled by the strong externally applied transverse and longitudinal fields
present in modern high gradient linear accelerators. Thus, beam dynamics
studies investigating all relevant effects, applied and collective, are
necessary to predict the operational limitations of a given instrument. Such
modeling, involving a large number of computational particles, can require
significant numerical resources. In this paper we present a fast tracking code
which permits accurate evaluation of wakefield effects in rf linacs, while also
including a simple, robust model for space-charge forces to streamline the
computations. The features of such a tool are discussed in detail in this paper
and comparisons with more time-intensive commonly used tracking codes or
analytical models are utilized to validate the approach we introduce. In
addition, the applications motivating the development of this code define
unique and challenging scenarios from the perspective of beam physics.
Specifically, the fast simulation framework developed in this paper aims to
describe intense electron beams injected at low energy in high-gradient
accelerating structures which introduce strong rf focusing as well as strong

projection constants of Banach spaces of multivariate polynomials. The relative
projection constant $\boldsymbol{\lambda}(X,Y)$ of a subspace $X$ of a Banach
$Y$ is the smallest norm among all possible projections on $Y$ onto $X$, and
the projection constant $\boldsymbol{\lambda}(X)$ is the supremum of all
relative projection constants of $X$ taken with respect to all possible super
spaces $Y$. This is one of the most significant notions of modern Banach space
theory and has been intensively studied since the birth of abstract operator
theory. We focus on projection constants of Banach spaces of multivariate
polynomials formed either by trigonometric polynomials $f(g)=\sum_{\gamma \in
E} \hat{f}(\gamma) \gamma(g)$ defined on a compact topological group $G$, which
have Fourier coefficients $\hat{f}(\gamma)$ supported in a finite set $E$ of
characters; or analytic polynomials $P(z)=\sum_{\alpha\in

supported in a finite set $J \subset \mathbb{N}_0^n$ of multi indices.
Depending on the underlying structure (of the group, Banach space or index
set), the goal is to prove precise formulas or asymptotically optimal
estimates. Our general setting is flexible enough to handle a wide variety of
Banach spaces of polynomials, including analytic polynomials on polydiscs,
Dirichlet polynomials on the complex plane, and polynomials on Boolean cubes
$\{-1,+1\}^n$. Moreover, we get an explicit formula for the projection constant
of the space of trace class operators. The methods developed here enable us to
prove new estimates for important invariants such as the unconditional basis

These differences have immense and divisive social and political effects. If we

the social dynamics of gossip we can more effectively respond to the challenges

  Our argument has three parts. (1) We briefly critique epistemological and
truth-centered accounts of misinformation. (2) We describe a basic discursive
grammar of gossip as a social practice. (3) We, then, match the properties of
online information with this discursive grammar of gossip. While gossip has a
particular discursive form, its online modes involve a number of unique social
features that will have immense and divisive social and political effects. Our
goal is not to replace current accounts of information diffusion but to augment

newly born stars as a proxy for its gas motion. We find that the vertical angle
of young stars -- corresponding to their orbital phase perpendicular to the
Galactic plane -- varies significantly as a function of position along the
structure, in a pattern potentially consistent with a wave-like oscillation.
This kind of oscillation is not seen in a control sample of older stars from
Gaia occupying the same volume, disfavouring formation channels caused by
long-lived physical processes. We use a ``wavy midplane'' model to try to
account for the trend in vertical angles seen in young stars, and find that
while the best-fit parameters for the wave's spatial period and amplitude are
qualitatively consistent with the existing morphology defined by 3D dust, there
is no evidence for additional velocity structure. These results support more
recent and/or transitory processes in the formation of the Radcliffe Wave,
which would primarily affect the motion of the wave's gaseous material.
Comparisons of our results with new and upcoming simulations, in conjunction

increases by almost an order of magnitude and develops Lorentzian features near
the temperature T~225 K. These spectral changes were attributed to the
charge-density-wave phase transition even though the temperature of the noise
maximum deviates from the reported Peierls transition temperature in bulk

ease of validation, we propose an open-source APS testbed by integrating APS
controllers with two state-of-the-art glucose simulators and a novel fault
injection engine. The testbed is able to reproduce the blood glucose
trajectories of real patients from a clinical trial conducted over six months.
We evaluate the performance of two closed-loop control algorithms (OpenAPS and
Basal Bolus) using the testbed and find that more advanced control algorithms
are able to keep blood glucose in a safe region 93.49% and 79.46% of the time
on average, compared with 66.18% of the time for the clinical trial. The fault
injection engine simulates the real recalls and adverse events reported to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and demonstrates the resilience of the
controller in hazardous conditions. We used the testbed to generate 25 years of
synthetic data representing 20 different patient profiles with realistic

(VIs) are popular for this purpose, primarily leveraging the spectral red edge
in multispectral imagery. In contrast, spectral mixture models use the full
reflectance spectrum to simultaneously estimate area fractions of multiple
endmember materials present within a mixed pixel. Here, we characterize the
relationships between hyperspectral endmember fractions and 6 common
multispectral VIs in crops & soils of California agriculture. Fractional area
of green vegetation (Fv) was estimated directly from 64,000,000 5 nm, 3 to 5 m
reflectance spectra compiled from a mosaic of 15 AVIRIS-ng flightlines.
Simulated Planet SuperDove reflectance spectra were then derived from the
AVIRIS-ng, and used to compute 6 popular VIs (NDVI, NIRv, EVI, EVI2, SR, DVI).
Multispectral VIs were compared to hyperspectral Fv using parametric (Pearson
correlation, r) and nonparametric (Mutual Information, MI) similarity metrics.
4 VIs (NIRv, DVI, EVI, EVI2) showed strong linear relationships to Fv (r >
0.94; MI > 1.2). NIRv & DVI showed strong interrelation (r > 0.99, MI > 2.4),
but deviated significantly from 1:1 relative to Fv. EVI & EVI2 were also
strongly interrelated (r > 0.99, MI > 2.3) and more closely followed a 1:1
relation with Fv. In contrast, NDVI & SR showed weaker, nonlinear,
heteroskedastic relation to Fv (r < 0.84, MI = 0.69). NDVI showed especially
severe sensitivity to substrate background reflectance (-0.05 < NDVI < +0.6 for
unvegetated spectra) and saturation (0.2 < Fv < 0.8 for NDVI = 0.7). These
direct observational constraints on multispectral VI and hyperspectral mixture

bipolar cycling of metal (Pt/W)/Al0.93B0.07N/W/Al2O3 film stacks first induced
wake-up, then a region of constant switchable polarization. On additional
cycling, the film leakage current increased, and then films underwent
dielectric breakdown. For unpatterned first generation Al0.93B0.07N films with
100 nm thick Pt top electrodes survive ~104 bipolar cycles, whereas films with
1000 nm W top electrodes survive ~10^5 cycles before thermal dielectric
breakdown. Sentaurus modeling was used to design an SU8 field plate which
improved the performance to ~10^6 fatigue cycles. It was found that the thermal
failures during fatigue were not due to surface flashover events but were
associated with hard breakdown events in the dielectric. The films showed
excellent retention of the stored polarization state. As expected, data
retention was slightly inferior in the opposite state (OS) measurements.
However, it is noted that even after 3.6x10^6 sec (1000 hr). at 200{\deg}C, the

effective probe of the magnetic field topology in the interstellar medium and

the recently developed Histogram of Relative Orientations (HRO) analysis and
the polarization-intensity gradient (KTH) method are widely used to assess the
dynamic role of magnetic fields in star formation based on the plane-of-sky

variants, indicate that its largest uncertainty may come from the assumption of
energy equipartition, which should be further calibrated with simulations and
observations. We suggest that the ordered and turbulent magnetic fields of
particular observations are local properties of the considered region. An
analysis of the polarization observations using DCF estimations suggests that
magnetically trans-to-super-critical and averagely trans-to-super-Alfv\'{e}nic

more gravity-dominant than their low-mass counterparts due to higher column

relative orientation between the magnetic field and density structures changes
from parallel to perpendicular with increasing column densities, which, in
conjunction with simulations, suggests that star formation is ongoing in
trans-to-sub-Alfv\'{e}nic clouds. There is a possible transition back from
perpendicular to random alignment at higher column densities. Results from
observational studies using the KTH method broadly agree with those of the HRO

use a detection of gravitational waves from individually resolved SMBHB sources
to produce a purely gravitational wave-based measurement of the Hubble
constant. This is achieved by measuring two separate distances to the same
source from the gravitational wave signal in the timing residual: the
luminosity distance $D_L$ through frequency evolution effects, and the parallax
distance $D_\mathrm{par}$ through wavefront curvature (Fresnel) effects. We
present a generalized timing residual model including these effects in an
expanding universe. Of these two distances, $D_\mathrm{par}$ is challenging to
measure due to the pulsar distance wrapping problem, a degeneracy in the
Earth-pulsar distance and gravitational wave source parameters that requires
highly precise, sub-parsec level, pulsar distance measurements to overcome.
However, in this paper we demonstrate that combining the knowledge of two SMBHB
sources in the timing residual largely removes the wrapping cycle degeneracy.
Two sources simultaneously calibrate the PTA by identifying the distances to
the pulsars, which is useful in its own right, and allow recovery of the source
luminosity and parallax distances which results in a measurement of the Hubble
constant. We find that, with optimistic PTAs in the era of the Square Kilometer
Array, two SMBHB sources within a few hundred Mpc could be used to measure the
Hubble constant with a relative uncertainty on the order of 10 per cent.

programmable control of the piezoelectric coefficient ($d_{31}$) which serves
as the computational weight for multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. The
displacement of the piezoelectric unimorph was recorded by actuating the device
with different input voltages $V_{in}$. The resulting displacement was measured
as a function of the ferroelectric programming/poling voltage $V_p$. The slopes
of central beam displacement ($\delta_{max}$) vs $V_{in}$ were measured to be
between 182.9nm/V (for -8 $V_p$) and -90.5nm/V (for 8 $V_p$), demonstrating
that $V_p$ can be used to change the direction of motion of the beam. The
resultant ($\delta_{max}$) from AC actuation is in the range of -18 to 36 nm
and is a scaled product of the input voltage and programmed $d_{31}$ (governed
by the $V_p$). The multiplication function serves as the fundamental unit for
MAC operations with the ferroelectric NEMS unimorph. The displacement from many
such beams can be added by summing the capacitance changes, providing a pathway

increasing interest. TKGQA requires temporal reasoning techniques to extract
the relevant information from temporal knowledge bases. The only existing TKGQA
dataset, i.e., CronQuestions, consists of temporal questions based on the facts
from a fixed time period, where a temporal knowledge graph (TKG) spanning the
same period can be fully used for answer inference, allowing the TKGQA models
to use even the future knowledge to answer the questions based on the past
facts. In real-world scenarios, however, it is also common that given the
knowledge until now, we wish the TKGQA systems to answer the questions asking
about the future. As humans constantly seek plans for the future, building
TKGQA systems for answering such forecasting questions is important.
Nevertheless, this has still been unexplored in previous research. In this
paper, we propose a novel task: forecasting question answering over temporal
knowledge graphs. We also propose a large-scale TKGQA benchmark dataset, i.e.,
ForecastTKGQuestions, for this task. It includes three types of questions,
i.e., entity prediction, yes-no, and fact reasoning questions. For every
forecasting question in our dataset, QA models can only have access to the TKG
information before the timestamp annotated in the given question for answer
inference. We find that the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods perform poorly on
forecasting questions, and they are unable to answer yes-no questions and fact
reasoning questions. To this end, we propose ForecastTKGQA, a TKGQA model that
employs a TKG forecasting module for future inference, to answer all three
types of questions. Experimental results show that ForecastTKGQA outperforms
recent TKGQA methods on the entity prediction questions, and it also shows
great effectiveness in answering the other two types of questions.

segmentation. However, one remaining challenging problem is that segmentation
models do not generalize to unseen domains. To overcome this problem, one
either has to label lots of data covering the whole variety of domains, which
is often infeasible in practice, or apply unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA),
only requiring labeled source data. In this work, we focus on UDA and
additionally address the case of adapting not only to a single domain, but to a
sequence of target domains. This requires mechanisms preventing the model from
forgetting its previously learned knowledge. To adapt a segmentation model to a
target domain, we follow the idea of utilizing light-weight style transfer to
convert the style of labeled source images into the style of the target domain,
while retaining the source content. To mitigate the distributional shift
between the source and the target domain, the model is fine-tuned on the
transferred source images in a second step. Existing light-weight style
transfer approaches relying on adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) or
Fourier transformation still lack performance and do not substantially improve
upon common data augmentation, such as color jittering. The reason for this is
that these methods do not focus on region- or class-specific differences, but
mainly capture the most salient style. Therefore, we propose a simple and
light-weight framework that incorporates two class-conditional AdaIN layers. To
extract the class-specific target moments needed for the transfer layers, we
use unfiltered pseudo-labels, which we show to be an effective approximation
compared to real labels. We extensively validate our approach (CACE) on a
synthetic sequence and further propose a challenging sequence consisting of
real domains. CACE outperforms existing methods visually and quantitatively.

in coflow scheduling. However, standard CCT minimization may introduce
unfairness between the data transfer phase of different computing jobs. Thus,
while progress guarantees have been introduced in the literature to mitigate
this fairness issue, the trade-off between fairness and efficiency of data
transfer is hard to control. This paper introduces a fairness framework for
coflow scheduling based on the concept of slowdown, i.e., the performance loss
of a coflow compared to isolation. By controlling the slowdown it is possible
to enforce a target coflow progress while minimizing the average CCT. In the
proposed framework, the minimum slowdown for a batch of coflows can be
determined in polynomial time. By showing the equivalence with Gaussian
elimination, slowdown constraints are introduced into primal-dual iterations of
the CoFair algorithm. The algorithm extends the class of the sigma-order
schedulers to solve the fair coflow scheduling problem in polynomial time. It
provides a 4-approximation of the average CCT w.r.t. an optimal scheduler.
Extensive numerical results demonstrate that this approach can trade off
average CCT for slowdown more efficiently than existing state of the art
schedulers.

""universality"" property; for the welding minimizers this means that there is a
single, explicit algebraic curve $\Gamma$ such that truncations of $\Gamma$ or
its reflection $-\bar{\Gamma}$ in the imaginary axis generate all welding
minimizers up to scaling. While Wang noted her minimizer is SLE$_0(-8)$, we

specifically, it is a pair $(G, \lambda)$ where $G$ is a graph and $\lambda$ is

  It is known that Menger's Theorem does not hold on this context, i.e., that
the maximum number of internally vertex disjoint temporal $s,t$-paths is not
necessarily equal to the minimum size of a temporal $s,t$-cut. In a seminal

to be active more than once, giving a characterization also in terms of

economics and increasingly, artificial intelligence. These preferences are not
always known and thus may need to be estimated from observed behavior, in which
case a model is required to map agent preferences to behavior, also known as
structural estimation. Traditional models are based on the assumption that
agents are perfectly rational: that is, they perfectly optimize and behave in
accordance with their own interests. Work in the field of behavioral game
theory has shown, however, that human agents often make decisions that are
imperfectly rational, and the field has developed models that relax the perfect
rationality assumption. We apply models developed for predicting behavior
towards estimating preferences and show that they outperform both traditional
and commonly used benchmark models on data collected from human subjects. In
fact, Nash equilibrium and its relaxation, quantal response equilibrium (QRE),
can induce an inaccurate estimate of agent preferences when compared against
ground truth.
  A key finding is that modelling non-strategic behavior, conventionally
considered uniform noise, is important for estimating preferences. To this end,
we introduce quantal-linear4, a rich non-strategic model. We also propose an
augmentation to the popular quantal response equilibrium with a non-strategic
component. We call this augmented model QRE+L0 and find an improvement in
estimating values over the standard QRE.
  QRE+L0 allows for alternative models of non-strategic behavior in addition to
quantal-linear4.

the Henyey solver, we self-consistently account for adjustments in the interior

evaluate whether a dynamo can operate using the critical magnetic Reynolds
number. We run simulations to explore how planet mass ($M_{pl}$), core mass

lifetime of possible dynamo sources. We find that the $T_{eq}$ determines the
solidification regime of the magma ocean, and only layers with melt fraction
greater than a critical value of 0.4 may contribute to the dynamo source region
in the magma ocean. We find that the mantle mass, determined by $M_{pl}$ and
CMF, controls the thermal isolating effect on the iron core. In addition, we
show that the liquid core last longer with increasing planet mass. For a core
thermal conductivity of 40$\ \mathrm{Wm^{-1}K^{-1}}$, the lifetime of the

to find an $\epsilon$-minimizer of the overall objective; (ii) To design
algorithms which guarantee to find an $\epsilon$-minimizer of the overall

$1/\epsilon$) that the gradient oracle of each functions needs to be assessed
(i.e., upper bound). If these two bounds are at the same order of magnitude,
then the algorithms may be called optimal. Most existing results along this
line of research typically assume that the functions in the objective share the
same condition number. In this paper, the first model we study is the problem
of minimizing the sum of finitely many strongly convex functions whose
condition numbers are all different. We propose an SGD method for this model

analyzing and comparing the outputs of such models, it is possible to gain a
better understanding of the system itself. Though as the complexity of model
outputs increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to compare simulations to
each other. While it is straightforward to only compare a few specific model
outputs across multiple simulations, additional useful information can come
from comparing model simulations as a whole. However, it is difficult to
holistically compare model simulations in an unbiased manner. To address these
limitations, we use representation learning to transform model simulations into
low-dimensional points, with the neural networks capturing the relationships
between the model outputs without the need to manually specify which outputs to
focus on. The distance in low-dimensional space acts as a comparison metric,
reducing the difference between simulations to a single value. We provide an
approach to training neural networks on model simulations and display how the
trained networks can then be used to provide a holistic comparison of model
outputs. This approach can be applied to a wide range of model types, providing
a quantitative method of analyzing the complex outputs of computational models.

most cases, rather converging on a fixed point which is optimal for two
players, but not for the third. Further, we explore how the order of the
updates influences convergence. In addition to alternating and simultaneous
updates, we explore a new update order--maximizer-first--which is only possible
in a three-player game. We find that three-player games can converge on a Nash
equilibrium using maximizer-first updates. Finally, we experiment with
differing momentum values for each player in a trilinear smooth game under all

classification methods based on machine learning are increasingly being

large set of observations. However, well-designed, targeted models can reach
their classification goals with fewer computing resources. This paper presents
SNGuess, a model designed to find young extragalactic nearby transients with
high purity. SNGuess works with a set of features that can be efficiently
calculated from astronomical alert data. Some of these features are static and
associated with the alert metadata, while others must be calculated from the
photometric observations contained in the alert. Most of the features are
simple enough to be obtained or to be calculated already at the early stages in
the lifetime of a transient after its detection. We calculate these features
for a set of labeled public alert data obtained over a time span of 15 months
from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The core model of SNGuess consists of
an ensemble of decision trees, which are trained via gradient boosting.
Approximately 88% of the candidates suggested by SNGuess from a set of alerts
from ZTF spanning from April 2020 to August 2021 were found to be true relevant
supernovae (SNe). For alerts with bright detections, this number ranges between
92% and 98%. Since April 2020, transients identified by SNGuess as potential
young SNe in the ZTF alert stream are being published to the Transient Name
Server (TNS) under the AMPEL_ZTF_NEW group identifier. SNGuess scores for any

backdoor defense method to mark and purify the infected neurons in the
backdoored neural networks. Specifically, we first define a new metric, called
benign salience. By combining the first-order gradient to retain the

with higher accuracy than the commonly used metric in backdoor defense. Then, a
new Adaptive Regularization (AR) mechanism is proposed to assist in purifying

Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can erase the

For MLE, the results probably are model-specific local optimum when available

re-formulate crafting transferable AEs as the maximizing a posteriori
probability estimation problem, which is an effective approach to boost the
generalization of results with limited available data. Because Bayes posterior
inference is commonly intractable, a simple yet effective method called
MaskBlock is developed to approximately estimate. Moreover, we show that the

demonstrate that topological interface modes and trivial edge modes of a

optical power to topologically protected states. This is achieved in a
pump-signal configuration, in which an optical pump propagating in a bulk mode

between edge and topological interface modes. This tunable coupling mechanism
is particularly efficient due to the large Kerr coefficient of graphene.

a two dimensional system with all-to-all long range hopping. In the weak
disorder, cooperative shielding manifests itself as perfect conducting channels
identical to those of the short range model, as if the long range hopping does
not exist. With increasing disorder, the average and fluctuation of conductance
are larger than those in the short range model, since the shielding is
effectively broken and therefore long range hopping starts to take effect. Over
several orders of disorder strength (until $\sim 10^4$ times of nearest
hopping), although the wavefunctions are not fully extended, they are also
robustly prevented from being completely localized into a single site. Each
wavefunction has several localization centers around the whole sample, thus
leading to a fractal dimension remarkably smaller than 2 and also remarkably
larger than 0, exhibiting a hybrid feature of localization and delocalization.
The size scaling shows that for sufficiently large size and disorder strength,
the conductance tends to saturate to a fixed value with the scaling function
$\beta\sim 0$, which is also a marginal phase between the typical metal
($\beta>0$) and insulating phase ($\beta<0$). The all-to-all coupling expels
one isolated but extended state far out of the band, whose transport is
extremely robust against disorder due to absence of backscattering. The bond
current picture of this isolated state shows a quantum version of short circuit

paper, by second order central difference scheme and L1 nonstandard finite
difference scheme, a discrete counterpart of time-fractional reaction-diffusion
epidemic model with generalized incidence rate is considered. More importantly,
the main idea in choosing an nonstandard finite difference scheme is to obtain
unconditionally positivity in the proposed system, which leads to the proposal
of the discrete epidemic model with time delay. Furthermore, the global
properties of the proposed discrete system are studied, including the global
boundedness of positive solutions, the existence and the global stability of
equilibrium points, which are consistent with the corresponding continuous
systems. Meanwhile, it shows that L1 nonstandard finite difference scheme and
second order central difference scheme can keep the properties of the
corresponding continuous system well. It is worth noting that, different from
discrete epidemic model with integer-order, the memory Lyapunov function is
constructed in this paper, which depends on the previous historical information
of the proposed system. This is consistent with the non-local property of
Caputo fractional derivatives. Finally, numerical results are given to verify

causal ignorance regions shrink under additional prior assumptions about the
presence of null control outcomes, and provide new approaches for quantifying
the robustness of causal effect estimates. Finally, we illustrate our

small subset of tuples that preserves the best score with respect to any
nonnegative linear utility function, is an important problem in multi-criteria
decision-making. When an HMS is extracted from a set of individuals to assist
data-driven algorithmic decisions such as hiring and admission, it is crucial
to ensure that the HMS can fairly represent different groups of candidates
without bias and discrimination. However, although the HMS problem was
extensively studied in the database community, existing algorithms do not take
group fairness into account and may provide solutions that under-represent some
groups.
  In this paper, we propose and investigate a fair variant of HMS (FairHMS)
that not only maximizes the minimum happiness ratio but also guarantees that
the number of tuples chosen from each group falls within predefined lower and
upper bounds. Similar to the vanilla HMS problem, we show that FairHMS is
NP-hard in three and higher dimensions. Therefore, we first propose an exact
interval cover-based algorithm called IntCov for FairHMS on two-dimensional
databases. Then, we propose a bicriteria approximation algorithm called
BiGreedy for FairHMS on multi-dimensional databases by transforming it into a
submodular maximization problem under a matroid constraint. We also design an
adaptive sampling strategy to improve the practical efficiency of BiGreedy.
Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets confirm the efficacy
and efficiency of our proposal.

methods like Cholesky decomposition of large matrices at every timestep. In
this study, we perform Petascale BD simulations, with HI, of fairly long and
highly resolved polymer chains on modern GPUs. Our results clearly highlight
the inadequacies of the typical models that use beads connected by springs. In
this manuscript, firstly, we present the details of a highly scalable, parallel
hybrid code implemented on a GPU for BD simulations of chains resolved to a
single Kuhn step. In this hybrid code using CUDA and MPI, we have incorporated
HI using the Cholesky decomposition method. Next, we validate the GPU
implementation extensively with theoretical expectations for polymer chains at
equilibrium and in flow with results in the absence of HI. Further, our results
in flow with HI show significantly different temporal variations of stretch, in
both startup extensional and shear flows, relative to the conventional
bead-spring models. In all cases investigated, the ensemble averaged chain
stretch is much lower than bead-spring predictions. Also, quite remarkably, our
GPU implementation shows a scaling of $\sim$$N^{1.2}$ and $\sim$$N^{2.2}$ of
the computational times for shorter and longer chains in the most modern
available GPU, respectively, which is significantly lower than the
theoretically expected $\sim$$N^{3}$. We expect our methods and results to pave
the way for further analysis of polymer physics in flow fields, with long and

speed and efficiency. In particular, the task of FPI remains great challenges
due to the large differences between different views and the drastic spatial

much attention as an alternative to the cold dark matter. An intriguing feature
of the FDM model is the presence of a soliton core, a stable dense core formed
at the center of halos. In this paper, we analytically study the dependence of
the soliton core properties on the halo characteristics by solving
approximately the Schr\""odinger-Poisson equation. Focusing on the ground-state
eigenfunction, we derive a key expression for the soliton core radius, from
which we obtain the core-halo mass relations similar to those found in the
early numerical work, but involving the factor dependent crucially on the halo
concentration and cosmological parameters. Based on the new relations, we find
that for a given cosmology, (i) there exist a theoretical bound on the radius
and mass of soliton core for each halo mass (ii) incorporating the
concentration-halo mass (C-M) relation into the predictions, the core-halo
relations generally exhibit a non power-law behavior, and with the C-M relation
suppressed at the low-mass scales, relevant to the FDM model, predictions tend
to match the simulations well (iii) the scatter in the C-M relation produces a
sizable dispersion in the core-halo relations, and can explain the results
obtained from cosmological simulations. Finally, the validity of our analytical
treatment are critically examined. A perturbative estimation suggests that the
prediction of the core-halo relations is valid over a wide range of parameter
space, and the impact of the approximation invoked in the analytical
calculations is small, although it is not entirely negligible.

using two realistic, large-scale malware datasets, we evaluate the performance
of the CL methods on both binary malware classification (Domain-IL) and
multi-class malware family classification (Task-IL and Class-IL) tasks. To our

Especially for heterogeneous multi-agent systems in battlefield environments

fall short of addressing diversity among deployed agents. In this work, we
propose \textit{SynchroSim}, an integrated co-simulation middleware to simulate

difference-driven adjustable window size approach with a view to reducing

deployed agents to calculate a suitable window size before transmitting data

millimeter wave (mmWave) and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) are

the difficult acquisition of accurate CSI at the BS in frequency division
duplex (FDD) systems. Many researchers explored effective architectures based
on deep learning (DL) to solve this problem and proved the success of DL-based
solutions. However, existing schemes focused on the acquisition of complete CSI
while ignoring the beamforming and precoding operations. In this paper, we
propose an intelligent channel feedback architecture using eigenmatrix and
eigenvector feedback neural network (EMEVNet). With the help of the attention
mechanism, the proposed EMEVNet can be considered as a dual channel
auto-encoder, which is able to jointly encode the eigenmatrix and eigenvector
into codewords. Simulation results show great performance improvement and
robustness with extremely low overhead of the proposed EMEVNet method compared
with the traditional DL-based CSI feedback methods.

demonstrate that there is an optimal network size, which balances imperfections

specifically, since the average attenuation gradually alters in different parts

preferred black hole mass of RX J0134.2-4258 is $M_{\rm BH} \sim 2 \times

self-organization are not fully understood. Such an understanding is essential
because local structural properties of the settled material are then correlated
with the local stress, which calls into question existing linear theories of
stress transmission in granular media. A method to quantify the local
stress-structure correlations is necessary for addressing this issue and we
present here such a method for planar systems. We then use it to analyze
numerically several different systems, compressed quasi-statically by two
different procedures. We define cells, cell orders, cell orientations, and cell
stresses and report the following. 1. The mean ratio of cell principal stresses
decreases with cell order and increases with friction. 2. The ratio
distributions collapse onto a single curve under a simple scaling, for all
packing protocols and friction coefficients. 3. Cells orient along the local
stress major principal axes. 4. A simple first-principles model explains the
correlations between the local cell and stress principal axis orientations. Our
results quantify the cooperative stress-structure self-organization and provide
a way to relate quantitatively the stress-structure coupling to different
process parameters and particle characteristics. Significantly, the strong
stress-structure correlation, driven by structural re-organization upon
application of external stress, suggests that current stress theories of
granular matter need to be revisited.

estimates for the realization time are debatable. To arrive at human-level AI,
artificial general intelligence (AGI), as opposed to AI systems that are

getting much closer. Considering the recent technological developments, it
would be meaningful to discuss the completion date of human-level AI through
the ""comprehensive technology map approach,"" wherein we map human-level

and predict when all of them will be overcome. This paper presents a new
argumentative option to view the ontological sextet, which encompasses entities
in a way that is consistent with our everyday intuition and scientific
practice, as a comprehensive technological map. Because most of the modeling of
the world, in terms of how to interpret it, by an intelligent subject is the
recognition of distal entities and the prediction of their temporal evolution,
being able to handle all distal entities is a reasonable goal. Based on the
findings of philosophy and engineering cognitive technology, we predict that in
the relatively near future, AI will be able to recognize various entities to
the same degree as humans.

learning models, and detecting whether a given model has been backdoored
becomes a crucial task. Existing defenses are mainly built upon the observation
that the backdoor trigger is usually of small size or affects the activation of
only a few neurons. However, the above observations are violated in many cases
especially for advanced backdoor attacks, hindering the performance and
applicability of the existing defenses. In this paper, we propose a backdoor
defense DTInspector built upon a new observation. That is, an effective
backdoor attack usually requires high prediction confidence on the poisoned
training samples, so as to ensure that the trained model exhibits the targeted
behavior with a high probability. Based on this observation, DTInspector first
learns a patch that could change the predictions of most high-confidence data,
and then decides the existence of backdoor by checking the ratio of prediction
changes after applying the learned patch on the low-confidence data. Extensive
evaluations on five backdoor attacks, four datasets, and three advanced
attacking types demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed defense.

models. This is accomplished by exploring the latent space of GAN models. It is
demonstrated that interpretable directions can be found in the latent space and
they correspond to semantic image transformations. We further explore this
property in alpha matting. Particularly, we invert an input portrait into the
latent code of StyleGAN, and our aim is to discover whether there is an
enhanced version in the latent space which is more compatible with a reference
matting model. We optimize multi-scale latent vectors in the latent spaces
under four tailored losses, ensuring matting-specificity and subtle

models to produce meaningful embeddings of text with several applications, such
as text similarity. Despite significant progress in the field, the explanations
for similarity predictions remain challenging, especially in unsupervised
settings. In this work, we present an unsupervised technique for explaining
paragraph similarities inferred by pre-trained BERT models. By looking at a
pair of paragraphs, our technique identifies important words that dictate each
paragraph's semantics, matches between the words in both paragraphs, and
retrieves the most important pairs that explain the similarity between the two.
The method, which has been assessed by extensive human evaluations and
demonstrated on datasets comprising long and complex paragraphs, has shown
great promise, providing accurate interpretations that correlate better with
human perceptions.

the segmentation of brain structures in magnetic resonance (MR) images for

bias against certain demographic groups when they are under-represented in the
training sets. In this work, we investigate whether CNN models for brain MR
segmentation have the potential to contain sex or race bias when trained with
imbalanced training sets. We train multiple instances of the FastSurferCNN
model using different levels of sex imbalance in white subjects. We evaluate
the performance of these models separately for white male and white female test
sets to assess sex bias, and furthermore evaluate them on black male and black
female test sets to assess potential racial bias. We find significant sex and
race bias effects in segmentation model performance. The biases have a strong
spatial component, with some brain regions exhibiting much stronger bias than
others. Overall, our results suggest that race bias is more significant than
sex bias. Our study demonstrates the importance of considering race and sex
balance when forming training sets for CNN-based brain MR segmentation, to
avoid maintaining or even exacerbating existing health inequalities through
biased research study findings.

coarse-grained behaviour based on convolution averaging that mimics finite

order to reduce the number of RF chains and the channel estimation overhead, RF
beamformers are designed based on the 3D geometry-based mmWave channel model

precoder/combiner is designed by exploiting the reduced-size effective channel
seen from the BB stages. Then, the phase shifts of the RIS are adjusted to
maximize the achievable rate of the system via the nature-inspired particle

that the use of RISs in the AB-HBF systems has the potential to provide more
promising advantages in terms of reliability and flexibility in system design.

perform various tasks including debugging, performance analysis, and detection
of anomalies. Despite the importance of log data, the practice of logging still
suffers from the lack of common guidelines and best practices. Recent studies
investigated logging in C/C++ and Java open-source systems. In this paper, we
complement these studies by conducting the first empirical study on logging
practices in the Linux kernel, one of the most elaborate open-source
development projects in the computer industry. We analyze 22 Linux releases
with a focus on three main aspects: the pervasiveness of logging in Linux, the
types of changes made to logging statements, and the rationale behind these
changes. Our findings show that logging code accounts for 3.73% of the total
source code in the Linux kernel, distributed across 72.36% of Linux files. We
also found that the distribution of logging statements across Linux subsystems
and their components vary significantly with no apparent reasons, suggesting
that developers use different criteria when logging. In addition, we observed a
slow decrease in the use of logging-reduction of 9.27% between versions v4.3
and v5.3. The majority of changes in logging code are made to fix language
issues, modify log levels, and upgrade logging code to use new logging
libraries, with the overall goal of improving the precision and consistency of
the log output. Many recommendations are derived from our findings such as the
use of static analysis tools to detect log-related issues, the adoption of
common writing styles to improve the quality of log messages, the development
of conventions to guide developers when selecting log levels, the establishment
of review sessions to review logging code, and so on. [...]

is consociated with the physics beyond the standard model of electroweak

in the universe including the highly energetic astrophysical objects such as
active galactic nuclei, blazar or supermassive black holes. When such high
energy neutrinos pass through any compact stellar objects like neutron stars or
white dwarfs, their flux can significantly reduce due to the exorbitant
magnetic field provided by these compact objects. For Dirac neutrinos, such
phenomena occur due to the conversion of neutrinos to their sterile
counterparts. In this work, we consider a neutron star possessing a spatially
varying magnetic field which may or may not decay with time. We find that, for
the non-decaying magnetic field, the flux of high energy Dirac neutrinos
becomes nearly half after passing through the neutron star. The flux is further
enfeebled by $\sim 10\%$ in the presence of muons inside the neutron star. For
decaying magnetic field, the flux reduction is abated by $\sim 5\%$ as compared
to the temporally static magnetic field. In the case of a white dwarf, the
depletion of flux is lesser as compared to the neutron stars.

The traffic flow system can be viewed as a dynamic process that transits

real-world traffic system with traffic operation actions like traffic signal

the historical states and the actions of traffic operations. In this paper, we
consider the problem of modeling network-level traffic flow under a real-world

this preprocessing can reinforce group-specific inequities. Our work questions
this choice by studying how imputation affects downstream algorithmic fairness.
First, we provide a structured view of the relationship between clinical
presence mechanisms and group-specific missingness patterns. Then, through
simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that the imputation
choice influences marginalised group performance and that no imputation
strategy consistently reduces disparities. Importantly, our results show that
current practices may endanger health equity as similarly performing imputation
strategies at the population level can affect marginalised groups differently.

present a general framework CAMA to generate adversarial examples by
manipulating graph structure and node features in a hierarchical style.
Specifically, we make use of Graph Class Activation Mapping and its variant to
produce node-level importance corresponding to the graph classification task.
Then through a heuristic design of algorithms, we can perform both feature and

are very useful in the astrophysical context. Chandrasekhar was the first to
solve this problem analytically, by considering atmospheric scattering. These
results have wide applications in the modeling of planetary atmospheres.
However, they cannot be used to model an atmosphere with emission. We solved
this problem by including \textit{thermal emission effect} along with
scattering.Here, our aim is to provide a complete picture of generalized finite
atmosphere problem in presence of scattering and thermal emission, and to give
a physical account of the same. For that, we take an analytical approach using
the invariance principle method to solve the diffuse reflection finite
atmosphere problem in the presence of atmospheric thermal emission. We
established the general integral equations of modified scattering function
$S(\tau; \mu, \phi; \mu_0, \phi_0)$, transmission function $T(\tau; \mu, \phi;
\mu_0, \phi_0)$ and their derivatives with respect to $\tau$ for a thermally
emitting atmosphere. We customize these equations for the case of isotropic
scattering and introduce two new functions $V(\mu)$ and $W(\mu)$, analogous to
Chandrasekhar $X(\mu)$, and $Y(\mu)$ functions respectively. We also derive a
transformation relation between the modified S-T functions and give a physical
account of $V(\mu)$ and $W(\mu)$ functions. Our final results are consistent
with those of Chandrasekhar at low emission limit (i.e. only scattering). From
the consistency of our results, we conclude that the consideration of thermal
emission effect in diffuse reflection finite atmosphere problem gives more
general and accurate results than considering only scattering.

convolutional neural networks for image classification task. However, the
majority of existing methods are weight-oriented, and their pruning results may
be unsatisfactory when the original model is trained poorly. That is, a
fully-trained model is required to provide useful weight information. This may
be time-consuming, and the pruning results are sensitive to the updating
process of model parameters. In this paper, we propose a metric named Average
Filter Information Entropy (AFIE) to measure the importance of each filter. It
is calculated by three major steps, i.e., low-rank decomposition of the
""input-output"" matrix of each convolutional layer, normalization of the
obtained eigenvalues, and calculation of filter importance based on information
entropy. By leveraging the proposed AFIE, the proposed framework is able to
yield a stable importance evaluation of each filter no matter whether the
original model is trained fully. We implement our AFIE based on AlexNet,
VGG-16, and ResNet-50, and test them on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet,

that for our methods, even when the original model is only trained with one
epoch, the importance evaluation of each filter keeps identical to the results
when the model is fully-trained. This indicates that the proposed pruning
strategy can perform effectively at the beginning stage of the training process

  Category-Level Object Pose Estimation","Accepted by IROS 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Category-level pose estimation is a challenging problem due to intra-class
shape variations. Recent methods deform pre-computed shape priors to map the
observed point cloud into the normalized object coordinate space and then
retrieve the pose via post-processing, i.e., Umeyama's Algorithm. The
shortcomings of this two-stage strategy lie in two aspects: 1) The surrogate
supervision on the intermediate results can not directly guide the learning of
pose, resulting in large pose error after post-processing. 2) The inference
speed is limited by the post-processing step. In this paper, to handle these
shortcomings, we propose an end-to-end trainable network SSP-Pose for
category-level pose estimation, which integrates shape priors into a direct
pose regression network. SSP-Pose stacks four individual branches on a shared
feature extractor, where two branches are designed to deform and match the
prior model with the observed instance, and the other two branches are applied
for directly regressing the totally 9 degrees-of-freedom pose and performing
symmetry reconstruction and point-wise inlier mask prediction respectively.
Consistency loss terms are then naturally exploited to align the outputs of
different branches and promote the performance. During inference, only the
direct pose regression branch is needed. In this manner, SSP-Pose not only
learns category-level pose-sensitive characteristics to boost performance but
also keeps a real-time inference speed. Moreover, we utilize the symmetry
information of each category to guide the shape prior deformation, and propose
a novel symmetry-aware loss to mitigate the matching ambiguity. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate that SSP-Pose produces superior
performance compared with competitors with a real-time inference speed at about
25Hz.

is addressed as a supervised learning objective by manually annotating faces
with entity labels. To bypass the annotation burden of this setup, several
works have investigated the problem by utilizing external knowledge sources
such as movie databases. While effective, such approaches do not work when
task-specific knowledge sources are not provided and can only be applied to
movies and TV series. In this work, we take the problem a step further and
propose to discover entities in videos from videos and corresponding captions
or subtitles. We introduce a three-stage method where we (i) create bipartite
entity-name graphs from frame-caption pairs, (ii) find visual entity
agreements, and (iii) refine the entity assignment through entity-level
prototype construction. To tackle this new problem, we outline two new
benchmarks SC-Friends and SC-BBT based on the Friends and Big Bang Theory TV

to discover which named entity belongs to which face or scene, with an accuracy
close to a supervised oracle, just from the multimodal information present in

energy consumption, a joint framework to optimize the precoding vectors at the

allocation, and the passive beamforming at the RIS subject to the power budget
constraints at both the BS and the relaying node, the quality of service (QoS)

formulated problem is a non-convex optimization problem due to the high
coupling among the optimization variables. To tackle this challenge, an
efficient algorithm is presented by invoking the alternating optimization
technique, which decomposes the original problem into two sub-problems; namely,
sub-problem-1 and sub-problem-2, which are alternatively solved. Specifically,
sub-problem-1 is to jointly optimize the precoding vectors, common stream

phase shift matrix at the RIS. In order to solve sub-problem-1, an efficient
low-complexity solution based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) is
proposed. Meanwhile, and with the aid of difference-of-convex rank-one

method to reduce the computational complexity involved in the message passing.
Moreover, an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is applied for tuning the

this study, we propose a bidirectional feature globalization (BFG) approach,
which leverages the similarity measurement between point features and prototype
vectors to embed global perception to local point features in a bidirectional
fashion. With point-to-prototype globalization (Po2PrG), BFG aggregates local
point features to prototypes according to similarity weights from dense point
features to sparse prototypes. With prototype-to-point globalization (Pr2PoG),
the global perception is embedded to local point features based on similarity
weights from sparse prototypes to dense point features. The sparse prototypes
of each class embedded with global perception are summarized to a single
prototype for few-shot 3D segmentation based on the metric learning framework.
Extensive experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet demonstrate that BFG significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

particular, the charge density wave (CDW) has the aspect of a quantum crystal
with a macroscopic wave function (order parameter), so unlike quantum liquids
(superconductivity, quantum Hall liquids $^3$He, $^4$He), new ground states
such as supersolid and Moir\'e solids can be expected. However, it is difficult
to describe these states because of their quantum aspect, hence there is still
no theory that can explain CDW phases in a unified way. The best way to
describe a quantum crystal seems to be a conformal transformation that allows
local deformation (wave properties) and preserves local angles (crystal
properties).
  Here, we propose a unifying conformal description of 2D CDW phases in the
typical 2D CDW material transition metal dichalcogenides (MX$_2$). We discover
that the discommensurate CDW phases in MX$_2$ can be explained beautifully by a
discrete conformal transformation of CDW wavevectors. This conformality is due
to commensurability of CDW with the MX$_2$ lattice. In other words,
interference of harmonic wavefunction induces conformality.
  Using this new conformal formulation, we explain experimental
nearly-commensurate/stripe/T CDW phases in 1$T$-TaS$_2$
($\sqrt{13}\times\sqrt{13}$ structure), 2$H$-TaSe$_2$ ($\sqrt{9}\times\sqrt{9}$
structure), and explain the origin of a new experimental nearly-commensurate
phase in TaSe$_2$ thin-film ($\sqrt{7}\times\sqrt{7}$ structure).
  This theory is very simple in the sense that it includes only
discommensuration and comprises physics as rich as quantum Hall liquids. This
new description will broaden our perspective of quantum crystals.

the information in probability volume, we creatively synthesize the source
